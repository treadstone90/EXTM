watching the match with man utd fans you'd confuse them for tottenham die hards .

a poor corner from holtby comes out to aguero . city counter-attack badly and tottenham regain possession .
portuguese left-back fabio coentrao , 25 , has dealt a blow to tottenham and manchester united by agreeing to stay at real madrid

tottenham can dream on about top 4 😂

tottenham could do with a penalty or 2 , or 3 , or 4
ht mancity 3 spurs 0 . lloris has been spurs main undoing in the 1st half .
annoying that there is no way tottenham will play this bad vs man u
man city spent over £100m & won the league , tottenham have no ' let the players gel ' excuse , you're shit .
mt : 3-0 
holy shit tottenham are bad
tottenham are getting brushed .. 😶
ah well we could get beat 10-0 & id still be tottenham till i die 💙
tottenham i dissapointed in you sia
why has tottenham jus got shit this season ! !
first time this season i've watched tottenham . wish i hadn't bothered . odds on avb being given the sack before santa picks his up this year ?
whats wrong with tottenham man
this has been a long time coming imo , they are papering over cracks at tottenham , he has wasted around 50 million on poor players imo
what are tottenham doing ?! 😣
it's half time ! 3-0 ! !
i'm gonna need tottenham to pick it up ! 
tottenham are now loosing 3-0 and aguero has now scored the same amount as their whole squad in the pl this season .
it hasn't been a good first half for tottenham hahaha
" this season in pl : sergio aguero 9 goals tottenham 9 goals "
fuck off tottenham , get back on the bus and stop embarrassing us . 
spurs are faclng a silvaless citeh ..... let that sink in tottenham fans
half-time : manchester city 3-0 tottenham . 😳
first half was far too easy . tottenham aren't even competing
how many of the tottenham players would you take at arsenal ?
supporting tottenham is so . i'm gonna go play with traffic for a bit 
man city fans singing , " you should have gone christmas shopping " to tottenham . spurs spent £100m this summer .
don't understand why all of the tottenham fans are getting upset about losing even thou the all week they said that they wanted to lose
kai !!! made so bad as a goalkeeper
nti paaa ni ...... no wonder c'os if u hv a striker who only scores from de spot this is wat happens
watching this and tottenham have literally nothing
hey tottenham .. how's the minute silence coming along ? 
it's becoming a chore watching tottenham at the moment . we've got the players but they're not being used in the right way .
aguero has equalled the number of goals tottenham have scored all season , thats embarrassing , £110million my arse
someone remind me never to watch tottenham again .. think i might be bad luck , i'm sure i've never watched them win
tottenham beyond a joke today , it's past the point of any of the 100 excuses so far this year . clueless , weak and quite frankly scary 
tottenham bringing on willian at half time .
ht : man city 3-0 tottenham it's only half time . there's 45 minutes of punishment left for spurs . 😄
it seems the tottenham hotspurs team is doing its best to be featured on comedy nights with kapil .
half time : manchester city 3-0 tottenham hotspurs ( navas 1 ' | negredo 31 ' | aguero 39 '
3-0 tottenham lololol
negative line up from avb have cost . he should have attacked mancity's defense rather than worrying abt their attack . 
tottenham really need to get it together . it's been very easy for city so far . come on !! looking forward to a great second half . 
' adebayor is the only player that can come on and change the game for tottenham ' :') hahahaha !!
i can't enjoy this tottenham performance simply because i'm not over how bad we were yesterday . 
what do we think of tottenham ?
man city leading tottenham by 3 goals at halftime , are they rising or tottenham are below par .
since bale left , tottenham's gone downhill
tottenham kalah . cardiff next 👏
tottenham's defence is on point
110m pounds , na bad market tottenham buy
basics of football somewhat nonexistent from tottenham . very poor . track your men , clear high / long , pass and * move* . shambles today . 
tottenham are helpless against the citizens . 
tottenham are a joke 😐
first half : man city 3-0 tottenham horrble game for spurs
 is a small club .
the best thing about tottenham was that they sold bale !
tottenham buy soldado for £26 million . manchester united by robin van persie for £24 million . wonder who got the better deal ?
even ray winston and paddy power are taking the piss out of tottenham hahaha
so glad i paid £65 to eat a sandwich rather than £65 to watch tottenham get smoked by man city .
tottenham paying for city's last week loss
 hahahaha , i am so enjoying this . wait till tottenham plays west brom and southampton . lol , they haven't seen nothing yet
what's happening tottenham hahaha ?

no bale to bail tottenham ☹
ht : manchester city 3-0 tottenham hotspurs 
soldado can't even run properly , lmfu . poor tottenham .
if tottenham didn't have bale last season , this game wouldn't exist . they would be in the championship
school-boy defending by tottenham and soldado looking as useless as a united player . city should see this one home . 
sergio aguero in epl 9 goals .... tottenham in epl 9 goals .... wonder where all those money spurs spent went .
tottenham find themselves inna firing range ....
omg tottenham are getting moved to ! looool aquero's on fire !
i find it hilarious that suarez has scored as many league goals this year as tottenham ... and he missed 5 games . 
halftime at the etihad ! city 3-0 tottenham . goals from navas , aguero and an own-goal by sandro ! 
i've always been a tottenham fan , and in my opinion this is the worse season to date !
half time : manchester city 3-0 tottenham
half time : manchester city 3-0 tottenham hotspur

 please leave tottenham rite now , please leave england rite now and go back to france .. i miss the old lloris :(
resorting to watching the rugby instead of dreadfull tottenham
tottenham have been dreadful . do not understand why chiriches is not playing at the back and this holtby is awful

man city strikers made tottenham hot spurs look like tottenham cold spurs loolx gunners errday baby
tottenham , i'm enjoying this . keep it up . 👍
anyone can beat tottenham . 
sergio aguero has scored more goals than tottenham this season .
i think tottenham were only good cause of bale last year
 after this 1st half do we say tottenham defence are the worst conceding 3 goals 
tottenham getting battered ooooooo 3-0
tottenham not going to be title contenders at all with the way they're playing now , embarrassing defending
wouldn't have thought tottenham would play so terrible with the side they've got , must be frustrating being a spurs fan
fuck off tottenham , no creative spark , nothing up front . mid table bollocks . gone so far backwards it's pathetic .
44'live ' man . city 3-0 tottenham ; ' goal ' zabaleta feeds navas , who's cross finds aguero to slot home for city's 3rd
supporting tottenham still continues to hurt ... a lot . 
3 players ( aguero , suarez & sturridge ) have scored the same amount of goals at tottenham hotspuds this season - 9 .
man city v tottenham and radio 5 live have the rugby on . i have no issue with this but where can listen to the game ?
i imagine those spurs fan's who moan at ' boring tottenham ' would kill for a 0-0 right now .. 
how much did we spend . this isn't the best team mancity can put out by some way , when we got at them they look awful at bk , but so do we 
shits gone down at man city vs tottenham ;) love being a gunner ;)
and the way it's going , i would be surprised to see villas boas in the tottenham dugout for another season
if only tottenham had someone to bale them out .

0 - tottenham goal difference
avb will be regretting not starting townsend . he's a great outlet for & makes things happen . they've lacked spark so far vs

usually fb and twitter timelines are filled with tottenham related crap .... they've all gone back in hiding
tottenham are now loosing 3-0 and aguero has now scored the same amount as their whole squad in the pl this season .
aguero has now as many goals as tottenham 
i wonder why the striker in the person of jermaine defoe with the best goal ratio for them should be warming the bench .
its always nice to see tottenham lose . 
yeah , with that dismal first half performance , tottenham are premier league contenders alright . i have no doubt . 
miracles really can happen ! we are 150/1 that tottenham can come back and win from this 3 goal deficite 01920 444144
tottenham only got 1 shot on goal ?!

trivia : aguero , sturridge , and suarez have each scored the same amount of goals as tottenham this year
tottenham can be a sh*tty team , but i think the early goal did them in . they tried to get back in too quickly & opened up at the back ...
tottenham getting trashed i see

nw watching mancity vs spurs
tottenham " best defence in the league " hotspurs have conceded 3 goals in 45 mins to the team in 8th position
tottenham were a one man team last season , & they're provin ' it this season

why do tottenham refuse to start defoe ? he's easily their best forward and would give them a chance in games like these
this tottenham team should b playing in d asian league . no no no !!! not fit for d epl ...
always nice to wake up to tottenham losing 3-0
city are just playing with tottenham like a senior team vs junior team ..
when a team does not know how to play , they should at least know how to keep quiet . 
and while we're at it i'd like to cleanse the tottenham facebook page . too many idiots on there
bale mst be pretty smug right now . £108 spent and tottenham were better when they only had him
tottenham have a good squad they are playing lamela on the wrong wing and the other thing andre villas boas is a idiot 😂😂😂😂😂
watching tottenham losing makes me happy
kaboul , dawson and walker have all been rubbish today on defense . they're practically sleep walking 
can't believe that bale has assisted and scored the same amount as the tottenham team have ! actually .. wait .. i can believe that 😒
love this footy man city v tottenham then man united v cardiff
tottenham hasn't been smashed this hard since the riots .
 i wish mancity could play like dis away from home .
tottenham spend 100 million for some great players but even one of them can't make 9 goals before half season
wow tottenham have 6 goals from open play this season . that is shocking 
taa !!!! : man u fans are not allowed to laugh at tottenham until the goal tally reaches 4 - 0 ."

mancity is on fire wtf
tottenham have the shittest fans
tottenham till i die , i'm used to us being shit have been for my 33 years love and hate them rolled into one can't smile without you
i've never been actually embarrassed to be a tottenham fan , but today is looking to change that
tottenham clearly need a washing machine . i don't think villas boas is the main man to blame , but there is some individual quality missing .
mancity under pellegrini have made the ethiad a fortress , but can they replicate their home form away ? not likely yet .
pree my retweets of tottenham fans though looool
tottenham are not a good side , spurs fans think they might be up ther this season . not a chance , they're poo ! 6th place finish for them .
not a good match so far .. hope they score some goals soon :-d go-go-go !!! :-)
tottenham are so dead it's unreal

tottenham back 4 all just retired from international football . 
we weren't even that good , tottenham were awful . their back 4 is so average and they've got serious problems attacking-wise .
tottenham whaddup
i'd actually die of laughter if tottenham's £115m 2013 summer ends up as a bigger bust than liverpool's ~£100m 2011 spending spree .

will tottenham survive this humiliation from man city ? 
i was counting on tottenham to get points out of city .. they've clearly failed . don't mind a 5-0 scoreline

i don't know who that is at centre back for tottenham but he is lie-kaboul in a china shop . 
all tottenham supporters let make a prayer circle

man city killing tottenham
tottenham buzz , defore is a goal scorer
extend the lead man city !!!! 
tottenham best be coming out a diffrent team to show any sort of respect for themselves
man city scored same amount of open play goals against norwich as tottenham have all season
what are they doing tottenham , such defensive lapses in the spurs play is just disgusting , avb has really messed up with the club 
adebayor haha , that's basically tottenham throwing in the towel .
mancity absolutely pulping spurs ! seem to be on a different planet
mancity ftw
being on a coach right now seems like a better option than watching the tottenham game .
now how can tottenham be a rival/threat to arsenal . it has always been 
tottenham will turn the game around .
tottenham getting shit on by manchester city
it's beyond me why tottenham start soldado instead of defoe
 adebayor on ? city 3-5 tottenham . adebayor to score 5 .
the best for me to watch right now for me is mancity vs tottenham
tottenham losing 3-0 , bring on adebayor . 
i still love you tottenham ... 
over £100 million spent and tottenham send on adebayor to save their season ha !
score at least one goal today for the love of god ... 
tottenham's 3rd kit is awesome
tottenham are shot foys
two up front get in adebayor come on tottenham we will be better in the second half 
don't know why people are surprised by tottenham losing , they're shit and they don't belong at the top .. 
awful tottenham .
some of the tottenham fan thought avb was great manager 
no way tottenham can get back into this .
then tottenham just had to ruin th party for us ... #
under way city vs tottenham
i don't like tottenham but it isn't nice to see city win , ah well , anything that puts pressure on arsenal is fine by me .
see as man city dey rip tottenham apart and na first half dem still dey o
sad to see tottenham mismanaging lamela so horrifically , he has had so much potential since his river plate days & he's only 21
i think 2 more goals r coming after ht . 
when i was younger my dad told me to support chelsea , i said no i'll stick with tottenham . i don't regret that decision !
guessing adebayor coming on will turn tottenham into a 4-4-2 . unless he took of soldado . but i dont think they would
pretty sure tottenham have accepted defeat now .
tottenham had only conceded two first half goals in the pl all season before today - nightmare 😡😞 .
so solution in 2nd half is !! wahahahaha
tottenham are 3-0 down so they bring on adebayor ? he couldn't score in a brothel
tottenham looked very stretched in the first half
why the fuck ain't jermaine defoe comming on ? something seriously wrong at tottenham . if was a spurs fan i wouldn't be happy
can tottenham perform a miracle and score 4 in the second half please ? 🙏
everyone should just unfollow me whilst tottenham play , i fucking drain it
tottenham bringing on the worst striker to ever play in the premier league
its a bad day to be a tottenham supporter ...
don't worry tottenham , adebayor is coming on 😂
tottenham tottenham tottenham what's going on ?
tottenham 😂 what a mess
definitely stopped watching this city-tottenham match
personally i dont think tottenham will see european football next year
adebayor coming in to spice up tottenham hopefully
my predictions are manchester united and tottenham to win , ndrwmna 1002p << 4 rt's & mentions
city exploiting everything wrong with tottenham all season long . lamela and holtby have been clueless , soldado has yet to turn up .
tottenham is shit .
adebayor is coming on , tottenham are going to try and get a goal .. this will more than likely result in many goals for man city
tottenham bringing on adebayor is like having a player sent off 
tottenham is so bad lol
tottenham is such a pussy , havin ' most of the finest material but still no match to the shitty
oh i give up on tottenham
man city pounding tottenham ....
 manchester city - tottenham
it's fair to say tottenham have admitted defeat by bringing adeabyor on
luis suarez-9 goals in 6 matches . tottenham-9 goals in 12 matches ! overpriced players 
tottenham should just stop
sergio aguero has scored 9 goals in the premier this season . tottenham have scored 9 goals as a club in the epl so far .
tottenham though ,, spent 108mil , scored just six goals from open play ,, and three penalties that gave them 9 points .. smh
manchester city 3-0 tottenham
defoe needs to leave tottenham . doesnt get a look even though in my opinion hes one of the best english striker about !
watching the tottenham man city match , come on tottenham , you can do better than that !
tough start to my sunday : 1 ) my stud te , julius thomas , is likely out for tonight's game . 2 ) tottenham is down 3-0 to man . city already ! uhg
tottenham have scored 9 total goals .... sas 18 goals
this tottenham game sucks a lot . but at least the blazers won ( again ) last night .
sturridge has scored the same amount of goals as tottenham this season ... he cost £12 mill , the spurs team cost £110 mill ... 
hahaha tottenham putting adebayor on . must really want to get back into this game
" tottenham are title contenders , arsenal are not " yeah we can see that
adebayor is still in tottenham ? hmmm ...
2nd half : manchester city 3-0 tottenham hotspurs 
supporting tottenham is too much for me😭
man city crushing tottenham
tottenham have given up , throwing in the towel for holtby 
watching ireland vs new zealand , proteas vs pakistan , man city vs tottenham . all playing at the same time . channel hopping for days !
tottenham 3 nil down and bring on adebayor 😂 
mancity
tottenham need 3 penalties to have a chance loool
on top for tottenham hahaha they've been sussed out . 
tottenham once again giving every football fan joy , fuck off you cunts
tottenham have downloaded the 2011/12 liverpool virus .
nothing funnier than watching tottenham lose
adebayor's coming on . all hope for tottenham is lost
tottenham having a bendtner problem of their own ... 
tottenham getting decimated , and bring adebayor on instead of defoe ?! i just don't get it 
it's man city 3 and tottenham 0 at half time . can you predict the final score ? 
they were saying in the first half tottenham need to play 442 now there bringing on adebayor there saying it's a shite decision 
english premier league half time man city-3 tottenham-0
tottenham choking as usual , haha
buying so many players doesn't mean you've had a good transfer window . tottenham are a prime example .
tottenham might as well put a defender on to stop city from scoring more . putting adebayor on wont make any difference
watching vs . now leading 3-0
i'm going 2 hours early to work because tottenham have pissed me off
 mancity have so much talent ! do not understand why so poor on the road .
tottenham miss modric and bale so much !
aguero has as many goals as tottenham this season😂😂😂 
actually fuck that tottenham are shit
' tottenham players watch on as man city show them how to score a goal from open play '
how is the tottenham manager so shit how can you not make a good team with that much money ?
tottenham ' till i die .. i'm tottenham ' till i die ... i know i am sure i'm tottenham ' till i die ! 
😂 i love to see tottenham get whooped
tottenham fans right now : " yesssss adebayor , get us back in the game ! "
lmao tottenham can still come back yo
tottenham getting ripped looool
the seville men and aguero carry city . city 3 spurs 0 . ? mancity are rampant at home
tottenham suffering ..... i'm enjoying it and idek why .
it's tottenham's own fault for leaving the door open , right glenn ?
if only tottenham had someone to bale them out ...
waking up 7:30 am to watch the spurs get killed ? let's go ??
remember when tottenham thought they were better than us .... 😂😂😂 
tottenham are jus so crap
impressive 1st half by mancity , i just hope they can play this way away from the ettihad too .
holtby , figured . lets see if tottenham can get some pride back , new formation might spark them and at least create chances
lets go ! mancity
tottenham who ?
tottenham are playing disgraceful yet they have some quality players
100m spent in the summer and the best thing they've to bring on from the bench is emmanuel adebayor tottenham , ladies and gents .
man city shd remain some goals 4us as we play tottenham next week .. 
mancity kill off tottenham but lose against mckems !? mean mckems is better than tottenham . but position confuse lol 
tottenham switching the extra striker in may not be beneficial
let's try winning the league without scoring any goals . it is the tottenham way after all .. 
imagine tottenham that spent £100million in the transfer market and they are playing rubbish . avb pack ur bags ur going back to portugal .
i am sure city fans are happier to see adebayor than tottenham ones .
2º tempo , manchester city 3-0 tottenham . c'mon city . 
a fair weather supporter would switch off right now . i'm tottenham till i die ! bring on the second half !
still believe . c'mon tottenham .
tottenham getting ripped apart looool
go go 
i can see tottenham getting back into this game uno , 2 goals within the first 20mins of the half
defoe is hands down tottenham's best striker
1 goal for spurs in the 1st 10 minutes spells disaster for mancity i'd even predict a 5-3 spurs win !!
a way back for tottenham ? 
tottenham are nothing without bale fact .
once tottenham spend the money from bale they will be really good oh wait awkward ...
manchester city vs tottenham hotspur 1-0 . 20 ' sandro , yellow card , tottenham hotspur

tottenham must be sesperate bringing on adebayor
lescott on for city adebayor on for tottenham
tottenham continue to drift southwards in the prem . only 2 teams have scored fewer goals this season and they're both rooted to the bottom
just when you thought it can't get any worse for tottenham they bring adebayor on for the 2nd half ! hahaha 
i don't like how tottenham is just losing like that you know
barca gave me joy ystetdy , today mancity r doing mi strong thing

spurs were considered to have one of the best defences is epl . but still , mancity crushed them to pieces .

loving the absolute pounding tottenham fans are taking from arsenal fans . deservedly so too .

the last time i saw a tottenham fan on twitter was when it was the transfer window .
with city now 5-0 up , what is it about tottenham and not scoring , considering their plethora of attacking talent ...? 
tottenham is going to old trafford after this . they won't get as much of a beating , but they definitely won't win too . ☹
man city have scored more goals in 60 minutes than spurs have in their last 6 premier league games . now , mancity 5 : t'ham 0 . city rampage !

 the best game i'm watching today . speaking pulak
is the man city v tottenham game was a boxing match , the referee would have to stop it .
literally give up with tottenham . only one thing that's been positive has been the spurs fans
spurs until i die i don't care we lost i love my team <3
i'd stop trying if i were a tottenham player
new tottenham would flop now just waiting for liverpool aswell then leave the big guns to fight it out
