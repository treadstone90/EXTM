warning for milan defenders tonight - if you are expecting to have forrest in your back pocket , just watch he doesn't have his cock out ....
allegri's milan is not worth my anxiety , and the neapolitans better win . for calcio .
atmosphere at celtic park on a champions league night is amazing !

need ajax and celtic to pull something out the bag .
fancy celtic to draw tonight
the ac milan defence is terrible compared to what it used to be with the likes of maldini , nesta , stam and cafu !!
same idiot on commentery davy ?
the crappy crosses by milan players still continue , don't they train on how to kick them ? 
watching the celtic match for a wee change as it's on tv . üòä
when are ac milan going to realise they need to sign a decent keeper .
must admit it's fantastic to see celtic fans don't have an offensive banner or flag this time 
come on celtic , do it for the scots .
i hope celtic and that ginger twat lose
ac milan ain't the team they used to be . they'll still probably win though .
i might change to watching celtic-milan now . this game is over really .

great start celtic . lets hope for an early goal and keep the pressure up !
celtic better lose
on skybet , they have suspended betting on 9-0 celtic . you can still bet on any other scoreline . will wait patiently for the chance to bet ..
goalkeeper has made a few errors for milan already , punched the ball right at his own player , throw in celtic
oh , and its 0-0 ... still is after that corner . milan keeper has a touch of the joe hart about him , tho .. might come i handy at some stage
 night again so i've got celtic - milan and basel - chelsea on for the night .

this milan goalie is a fud . get rattling the ball at him .
kayal just took a split-second too long to get his shot away . what a chance that is for celtic .
watching milan play :d
milan all over the place at crosses and corners - we need to capitalise on that better .
what did the celtic banners say ?
come on milan

milan looking dead nervy at the back here
forza milan 
very few places beat celtic park on a european night ! 
celtic started fantastically !
changing channel to milan's game ... nervous start in dortmund-napoli .
be very very surprised if milan keep a clean sheet tonight 
tonight i am a basel and celtic fan
quite jealous of my dad being at the celtic/milan game .
got to admit celtic home support in the champions league is very good !
celtic & ac milan game is where its at
fuk but milan keeper awfull !! but great start by celtic
listen to celtic park tonight boys !! class
i fell asleep and no one thought about waking me for the celtic game , idiots . i woke myself anyway so it's cool !
missed two great chances early doors celtic
there is life after breaking bad . mike ehrmentraut is in goal for ac milan tonight . either him or the bloke out the stereo mcs .
i'll get this out the way early : this is the worst ac milan team of all time and one of the worst italian teams ever to compete in europe .
why does kayal still have a spot in any celtic team riddle me that
milan are nothing on the team they used to be !!
incoming news : brendan owns the entire milan album and sings it on a regular basis . favorite lyric " who is that girl i see ?"
too close milan .
eveytime i put a bet on celtic always seem to be playing milan ! ha
i'm no genius but i've found out heyy ac milan are 13th and haven't won a match is 7 games ... it's the bald fella with the gloves on .
c'mon celtic
can't wait till tomorrow morning to read about the celtic park atmosphere , again .

what game to watch tonight ...... hmmm celtic vs milan i think
nearly as good an atmosphere as at a harty match 
european nights at celtic always sound special 
this celtic v ac games gonna be intense !
 looking good . looking fragile but dangerous . solid start
celtic playin ' well !
this milan keeper looks like a liability fur them already
would love to be at celtic park on a champions league night . unbelievable atmosphere
milan have healthiest keeper in the world ! never catches anything . already more punches than froch managed on saturday
what a chance . celtic have started very well 
close there but celtic need to take their chances
my dad is too much when celtic playüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
decent start from us 
celtic to win 2-1 tonight
the atmosphere at celtic park is unbelievable !!!
celtic won't ever get a better chance to beat ac milan

that is a fucking disgusting display from the green brigade tonight . surley decent celtic fans want this support for terrorism to end ?
milan keeper has to be tested with the high ball into area , non the hhops ! kayal moved like kylie on that chance in the box .

couple of half chances already for celtic . bodes well for them
abbiati looking really uncertain inside opening 10 minutes here . celtic must put pressure on him from crosses , set-pieces , etc .
milan are a poor poor team ..

no watching the game but that milan keeper looks fucking dodgy
celtic are proper shite man what are they doing in the champions league

balotelli is so many levels above anyone in this milan team when he's on it
dangerous fk for milan . think big balo will smash this from 30+ yards

milan will win this . every time abate takes the right wing , he's left unmarked . simple one two passes should do .

you can't hate kaka even if he does score against celtic ... 
fuck sake celtic man
pathetic from celtic . started with kayal not paying attention , followed by mulgrew fannying about followed by amateur marking . brilliant .
that really is awful defending from celtic . milan will just sit back now and soak up all the pressure
goal ! | celtic - milan 0-1 . kaka !
meanwhile , kaka scores for milan . hopes to advance to next round today .
happy that bvb is winning but that faded out when celtic conceded
fucking ridiculous goal to concede 
poor goal to loose from celtic point of view . somebody has to man mark surely ?? 
wow kaka is really thriving at ac milan , ecstatic for him . great guy , great player
kaka .... halagasha milan , you play crap my team but i still got mad love for you . let's seal qualification ... 
celtic , arsenal , chelsea , barcelona all to win . well that's my only bet done for the evening . ...
the goal was from a corner ..... kaka had a free header it was poor defending by celtic
als celtic ff wint ..
i've never seen worse marking at a corner than that n i'm a liverpool fan 
if i get my runnin shoes on a might make it to celtic park in time to pick kaka up at the next corner üòÇüòÇüòÇ
you know milan is in trouble when i read the team sheet and am relieved that bonera is starting . smh
real madrid made a big mistake selling kaka , he's absolute class at milan now !
goooaaall milan get in - stuff the celts !!!
kaka scores the easiest goal of his career . celtic - ac milan 0-1 . 
that milan goal was a terrible goal to concede . zonal marking is rubbish .
woeful defending by celtic , forster should have done better too .
get in milan !!!!!! 
that was shocking defending by celtic leaving alone .
kaka didn't need to jump to head that in he was only 4 yards from the goal line . goalkeeper should have come for it ! 
kaka seems to have re found himself since he's gone back to milan
haha fuck celtic !
told yous !!!!! out your family's mortgages on ac milan ! gooooodnight celtic 
a totally unmarked kaka heads home in the six-yard box from valter birsa's corner from the right . it is 0-1 after 13 minutes .
yess kaka keep pushing milan forward !!! daiiiiiii fenomeno !!!!!!!
classic celtic
goal . celtic 0 milan 1 . the unmarked kaka nods in from four yards . 12 mins gone .
who else ? kaka clearly leading by example . gets the first goal for ac milan away to celtic . 13mins : celtic 0-1 milan . 
is kaka back to his best ? doing sick at milan
fucking hate celtic
fucking hell celtic !!
kaka has put ac milan 1-0 up in their champions league match against celtic .
fancied kaka but fancied celtic win hmmm ac milan maybe to get back a bit of form 
poor defending from celtic ! 
come on celtic !
cheap goal - and milan actually looked like they didn't have the heart for this first 10 mins
that was far to easy for milan . far to easy .
kaka seems to have reformed himself after his move back to milan !
celtic struggling 
that has to be the best set piece defending i've ever seen from there !! 
go haaaaaaard ac milan
ff should not have let that go for a corner in the first place . 
hope celtic lose about 5-0
goal ! kaka capitalises on an error from celtic and gives milan the lead at celtic park , the italian giants lead 1-0
yaaaaaaaaaaasassssssaaaaa !!! btw may i mention that united have conceded less goals than celtic ! best defence in the league !!!
been playing cod ghosts , switched it off , put the tv on and just saw milan score :) aye , tonight's a decent night :)
absolute gift of a goal , awful celtic .
unbelievable organisation at a set piece there from celtic . absolute gift for kaka
kaka wasted so many years at madrid . back at milan where he belongs
no matter how much you may want celtic to score ... you just cant hate kaka 
brilliant .

shocking defending from celtic . and how much of a pussy is forster he should of took ball and player

for the love of all that's good please pull off a win today . 
fuck off milan !
goooooaaal ! celtic glasgow vs . ac mailand . livescore 0-1 
free header 5 yards out , celtic non defending laughable . and as for england's number 2 , is he nailed to that goal line .
kaka the legend 1-0 against celtic
horrendous defending and pathetic goalkeeping . fuck sake . c'mon celtic !!
kaka going back to milan was the best decision he ever made . quality player 
celtic's defending for that goal was possibly the worst marking of all time , kaka does it again against them
milan lead 1-0 at celtic park !
would love the big mental fascist that is abiatti to start noising up the celtic fans .
great to see the legend kaka firing for milan !
wtf where's the defence he was standing in the box unmarked c'mon celtic get the shit together man ,
so far so good for milan and arsenal üòå‚öΩÔ∏è
i would love to go to celtic park at least once in my life time

kaka is doing great with milan
now kicking off , we have arsenal v marseille , basel v chelsea and celtic v ac milan ! polar bear
shocking defending from celtic . easy goal for kaka
what happened to the solid defence at that goal ?
ucl : celtic 0-1 ac milan // kaka scores !!!!!!! 
how many times do celtic concede in the champions league after being the better team by far ? joke
good to see the celtic wankers losing !!!
milan take the lead against celtic [ 1-0 ]
yass fuck you celtic yah wee wanks
kaka has been the only positive in an otherwise forgettable start to the season for milan .
celtic are not going to bother marking kaka then ? alright then . 1-0 milan 
ac milan is a dead team . kaka puts them in front tho
almost as hopeless as me for taking celtic to beat milan , what was i thinking
celtic's defending for that goal was sooooo bad it's untrue
one milan player , surrounded by 5 or 6 celtic players in the six yard box . how on earth does kaka end up nodding that in ? woeful defending .
kaka scores to put ac milan a head in the 12th minute of the game against celtic . 1 - 0
looks like celtic will be winning no trophies this season .
what a terrible goal for celtic to concede - it doesn't come any easier than that .
kaka wat a legend scores again for milan
come on bvb , celtic and chelsea

i see celtic are struggling in their warm up game against a provincial side from italy as they try to prepare for tynecastle on sunday .
a reminder that my blog about celtic wanting ajax to draw only applied if they beat ac milan tonight . want ajax to lose otherwise .
kaka puts milan 1-0 up and porto losing 1-0 at home
goal ! kaka gives ac milan the lead after being left in acres of space to head home past forster
my celtic score pprediction is fucked already
poor goalkeeping/defending from celtic free header for kaka and forster could of come and claimed the corner but didn't .
lol ! how awful was celtic's marking on that corner !?
everyone said kaka's lost it ... no way just needed to be back at milan !!
kaka just doesn't fail to disappoint in milan colours . not then , not now .
that ac milan shirt looks sick on mario balotelli
my live stream goes down for 15 seconds and celtic are down 1-0
come on there is more to defending than standing in your 6 yard box and pointing at each other .... surely ?
damn kaka scores , come on celtic i need a draw !
celtic marking üê¥
celtic park even more quiet now atmosphere is pretty bad

fucking shock kaka scored against celtic !!
marco reus has given the lead in germany , while kaka has given milan an early lead at parkhead , leaving celtic with it all to do .
the prince of milan . 
kaka is one of milan's greatest players of all time 
while everyone else is watching arsenal and chelsea i'm watching celtic vs milan

celtic xi vs ac milan : forster ; lustig , izaguirre , mulgrew van dijk , ambrose , boerrigter , kayal , forrest ; samaras , commons .

six defenders and a goalie in the 6 yard box vs the smallest man on the park ... oh dear celtic !

kaka gives ac milan the lead against celtic . the brazilian was unmarked in the six-yard box from a corner .
going to get kaka on the back of my milan top
a good reason not to support milan : abbiati's political sympathies make berlusconi look like errico malatesta
that was such an easy goal for kaka . poor marking from celtic from the corner .
you know when you're in a solid relationship when your boyfriend goes moody because celtic are losing
c'mon you bhoys ! 
kaka doing well in his return to and puts them ahead . seems to be the only positive for them at the moment !
froza milan ‚ù§Ô∏ègood luck chelsea üíôüíô

always had a soft spot for ac milan since i saw a 5 a side team at home called ac milarne in the 80's . looks easy for them tonight :-)
you would have to say kaka ' is a shadow of his former self but that was poor defending by celtic .
kaka . the scourge of celtic . still remember that solo effort against them some years back in the ucl semis .
not a good start . 
and this one of the weakest ever milan teams aswell , terrible defending
really shocking defending there ffs mon 
wish celtic milan was on tv rather than this arsenal shite 
birsa assisted milan's opening goal vs celtic . direct corner kick , kaka with the header . celtic 0:1 milan , 12 '. his first assist for milan .

we all know how bad milan are these days , what does that say for the tims ! 
mon the hoops ! hate how i can't watch the games because of practice but i have a good feeling ! 
absolute no leadership in celtic defensive , 6 static defenders & a goalkeeper indescive 
at last milan scores from a set piece .... been ages .
remember when ac milan were the team to be on like pes3 or pes4 can't remember that fake line up they had omds üòÇ
celtic are losing coz james forrest is a dick-flashing wee pissfreak , imo
i wouldn't mind if we got played off the park by these bigger teams but it's just dreadful mistakes every time killing us ! 
shocking defending from celtic , all the time in the world for kaka there .
been forced to watch celtic game at work on break and have to admit that was üí©üí©üí©üí©defending by them
future orlando city player kaka on the scoresheet for milan in ucl today . 
its safe to say kaka is back ! he's scoring at will for milan
 !!!! c'mon celtic , step it up !!!!!!!!!
here do celtic fans actually believe they pictures wi messi sayin he loves the atmosphere at celtic park are real ??
kaka should never have went to milan !
i've seen better defending from corners in the falls park on a saturday morning . wake up celtic !
kaka !!!! fuck off celtic you bunch of cunts . serves you right terrorist sympathising cunts
if my sunday league team conceded a goal like celtic just did in the champions league , i'd go uber beserk . absolute shambles

how easy was that for milan ? fuckin poor celtic
that is awful defending/ goalkeeping 
stream froze and when it unfroze , celtic were a goal down . 
terrible goal to lose in your own 6 yard box 
so disappointing from celtic ..
can't afford to give free headers at tho level ! c'mon celtic !!!!
ohhh putain celtic
well that's a disaster 
great atmosphere at celtic park now 
shocking defence from a messy celtic . zonal marking is shite .
one third of d philippines live in milan
kaka is really performing well at ac milan
kak√°'s last cl goal for ac milan had dated back to 6 november 2007 . his 29 career cl goals extend record by a brazilian in 
that was honestly the worst piece of defending i've seen in professional football . 
celtic with the poorest marking since scott brown sat his english standard grade .
didn't know half my newsfeed supported ac milan üòïüòï
goal for ac milan ... kaka you beauty love it . keep up the good work 
its a poor league . really surprised they even have a chance to progress ..

celtic vs ac milan live on ss7 
zonal marking at it's worst 
that's how to silence a fucking crowd . primary school defending fi celtic ffs
brilliant man to man marking there from celtic 
celtic proving exactly why zonal marking never works . 
kaka actually had to bend down to head a ball in the middle of celtics 6 yard box . well no quite bit haha up yees ya wankers 
trust the scottish commentator to blame fraser forster for that milan goal , nothing to do with the 6 defenders not attacking the ball .
not the best start celtic but 75 mins to go . could probs play 7 holes in golf in that time . 
kaka ' a blessing for ac milan :
criminal defending by celtic there
kaka is a brilliant player but for fuck sake . c'mon celtic .
1-0 milan at celtic park . hopefully the first of many .
wow celtic ... 5 guys just stood flat footed and gave that goal away .
big goal denting celtic's qualifying chances they are behind against ac milan kaka with the goal !
what a simple goal for ac milan ! don't get why teams do zonal marking . too many goals conceded .
you know , we can score a couple in injury time . no need for panic as yet . take it easy bhoys ... 
arsenal v celtic would be a good match .
rickyyyy kaka what a life saver this guy is milan 1 celtic 0 
heartbroken 
celtic won't break down milan now #2 -0 milan for me
celtic losing 1-0 to milan
zonal marking will be the death of celtic
lower league clubs laughing at celtic xxx
right celtic , get your fucking finger out .
its shocking defending by celtic . not one player attacked the ball . if you're gonna do zonal marking at least know how to do it ...
well celtic are fucked
there was a player coming in behind kaka to head that in as well . defensive statues from celtic . terrible
how no one is picking up kaka is beyond me ?! only milan player in a dangerous position and he's in so much space 
milan let's keep it simple . the only way we can qualify for next seasons champions league is by winning it . keep it simple guys . forza milan
* turns over to celtic , sees neil lennon shouting , turns back to holby city *
good to see kaka still scoring ... shame its against celtic 
like always kaka is there to save milan
soft goal to give away 
such a good start thrown away , strut your stuff again celtic !
the worst thing about these celtic fans and their irish shit is that they are all scottish people that have never crossed the see yet they
come on barca and celtic
defending from celtic at that milan goal was comical . wouldn't see my old primary school leave someone so free in box like that !
the worst has happened ! the question now is ..... what you going to do about it celtic ?????
poor defending from celtic ... 
so gutted shevchenko isn't playing anymore , he was a god at milan
fucking awful celtic . shameful . need a performance now ...

celtic 0-1 ac milan 12 mins . celtic must win if they wish to proceed 
 c'mon hoops , no panic ... we always needed 2

celtic hapless again . another reason why these uefa allocations are rubbish .
late to the party but yasssssssss milan
' an easy header for someone of kaka's ability ...'? phh ... that was an easy header for someone of my ability . celtic defence totally inept .
foster at fault . terrible goal to give away . still early doors 
chelsea game at 0-0 and ac milan have already scored 1 against celtic
shocking marking , sort it out celtic has to be better !
when was the last milan scored from a corner kick ???
kaka have 98 goals for milan
champions league or sunday morning league ? celtics defending from that corner was absolutely abysmal ! 
just seen the milan goal . why do teams insist on doing zonal marking , too many flaws !
kaka does it for milan
what a gift of a goal to give milan .
and they said kaka is finished ? forza milan !
celtic losing 1-0 twelves minutes into the game üò∞
and celtic ? fucking hell what's a man to do with all this football

c'mon celtic you haggis eating pricks win !

milan is right place where kaka belongs
fake celtic fans do my head in 
celtic may just go for it now 
i am really happy for kaka in milan he can always play among the starting 11 and show us his skills again
celtic that is fucking woeful !
i'm so happy for kaka .. the smile is back on his face clearly because he is enjoying his football again . one nil milan .
milan defence looks shaky
you can hear a pin drop at celtic park
celtic are all over the place
celtic are an embarrassment . the only team you can expect to bring politics into football
radiomeltdown : dj`mercury is celtic thunder - voices
ah fecksakes , get back into it after that disastrous goal . 
kaka's legacy was tainted by moving to real madrid ...... if he stayed in milan he would be the goat of milan and top 10-15 all time
so much wrong with that goal . really was shocking . 
match update from celtic park , james forrest stops in the middle of the park to have a wank
celtic gave kaka a free header inside their 6 yard box , are they serious ? can't be defending like that in the champions league
kaka 29 goal in cl , 3 goals against celtic
get in milan .
it's like people genuinely expect celtic to do well in the champions league . they're fucking shite .
seven celtic players , plus a keeper , gesticulate & search for someone to blame after kaka scores a header standing in the middle . yourself .
 ac milan .
joe hart has just fallen off the couch laughing 
the legend kaka scores against celtic to put milan 1-0 after 12 minutes !

schoolboy defending from the hoops 
kaka has now scored 1 goal in 3 appearances for ac milan this season in the champions league .
nonsense defending from celtic 
celtic player ' sex assault ' arrest : celtic player james forrest has been arrested in connection with an alleged sexual assault , polic ...

a david proctor in the celtic defence would have cleared that ! 
good old kayal . missed a sitter , then let kaka's effort trundle under his leg . still fancy celtic though .
celtic are losing . and the fact that kaka scored makes it more pleasing .
zonal marking or just pish defending ..... 
milan haven't even started we'll still win 2-1
good start for , whilst concede a soft goal against 
kaka is the best player at milan .. right ? right ? right ?
is that celtic getting beat already aye ? shame .

free header for kaka . celtic 0-1 milan . 
celtic defence surely had kaka first goal ? only suitable explanation for that defendingüòÇ
celtic just conceded the softest goal in champions league history ! 
when was the last time milan scored from a corner kick ???
wow ac milan is actually winning
how has kaka only scored 98 goals for ac milan . thought he scored loads b4 he left to real madrid
this ac milan side is probs the worst ac milan side i've ever seen
embarrassing stuff from celtic
didn't know milan had such a big scottish support judgin by tweets
terrible defending from celtic
goaaaal ! celtic a goal down ( already ) against ac milan . courtesy of kaka .
that is one of the worst bits of defending i've ever seen from a celtic team .
celtic will huff & puff all nite , but it'll be same result as every year in ecl shite !!!
celtic and their fucking ' zonal ' marking always piss me off . attack the fucking ball .
yes milan , in to those rabid pricks
kaka has just been banging in goals since joining milan . 
i refuse to believe that teams like celtic and rapid vien and all that rubbish deserve to be in the cl more than we do .
forever haunting celtic 
emanuelson vuole andare al celtic ???? 
kaka goin on nuts for ac milan they should of never sold him !
so many celtic defenders there but not one picked up kaka '. this is why italy always does well at wc , defending is the name of the game .
and if kak√° didn't put it , he had an unmarked teammate behind him too . pathetic from celtic .
horrible goal to give away for celtic !
silly early goal to concede can't afford to give anyone that space let alone kaka .. heads up celtic
kaka is enjoying life at milan its like he never left .
the biggest kaka fan in the world i fucking love you kaka you absolute fucking legend . forza ricky forza milan !!!!
kaka , celtic vs milan 0:1 
sake celtic
98 for ac milan !!!! 2 to go . c'mon ricky give us a hat-trick
sacchi today on celtic : " marking , pressing and restarts need to do damage to an opposing defense that isn't always tactically attentive ."
zonal marking wasn't the problem there , it's the absolute absence of anyone in that zone . it was bad zonal marking 
c'mon celtic ! 
kaka was now a ghost in the celtic box lol bout 5 men jus stand up round him !
still remember that commentary when kaka scord vs celtic in et kaka nd still kaka kaaaakaaaaaaa wat a finish !!!!! 
the awkward moment when celtic defenders say : who the fuck was marking kaka
literally nine celtic players standing round kaka ...
if kaka scores a hat trick tonight , it'll be 100 for him in a milan top
celtic vs ac milan it is
i think the celtic defenders have been learning how not to mark from the thistle defenders !
spoke to soon come on celtic
come on celtic
bit soft from celtic there . no , forrest doesn't have his cock out again , their defending is shocking
kaka just wanted to play for ac milan again .. convinced .. cause the fact he looks so good ..
fuckin hell , i've seen a team of monkeys more organised than celtic at the minute ... come on lads
yeah fuck off celtic
celtic shooting themselves in the foot again
kaka get celtic play book sha ... can wait for el sha to come back . get well soon mr pharaoh ! 
kaka scores and milan 1 up away @ celtic .
celtic are losingüëèüòè
goal kaka ! milan take a 1-0 lead over celtic in scotland .
i love watching ac milan 
celtic decided on zonal marking for the corner . but they failed to mark any zones .
kaka scoring on a champions league night for milan . reminds me of the good old days !
kaka has now scored milan's last three goals
could get ugly for napoli . ricky kaka . when you're a champion , you're a champion . 1-0 milan .
load of shite .... my face tells of a woman who hates her life , celtic you ruin me .
kaka scores for ac milan against celtic !!! he is back !
dam it kaka i want celtic to win
milan doh know how to pass
2-1 tae the celtic come the final whistle . keeeeemon
i thought utd were poor defending at the weekend !!! 
ac milan wtg !!! kaka on the scoresheet
absolutely dreadful goal to concede by celtic great for my bet though
horrendous attempt at zonal marking from celtic !! really shit goal to lose
our very own boy , kaka scores for ac milan . 
get it up you celtic !
i flick over to the celtic v ac milan match and miss the arsenal goal . switch back to arsenal match and miss the ac milan goal . 
goaalll ! kaka ! ' 13 ( celtic 0-1 milan ) 
poor defending from celtic . but kaka must get to 100 goals . :)
although it is actually spelt " caca " but you know what i mean ... 
probably the worst defending i've ever seen in the embarrassing celtic üò°üçÄ
sat my arse down 15 mins into game , goal milan , game off
 
reus scores for to keep group interesting . predict will get more goals out of this . not a bold prediction . ac milan 1-0 
kaka back at ac milan just feels right
2-1 celtic nae bither at all
if fraser forster couldn't keep a clean sheet for england both international games then he was never going to keep out milan
so which game should i watch ? milan , barca , arsenal , dortmund . not planning on multitasking
milan are diving cunts .
five celtic players and the goalie in the six yard box to the one milan player and we concede a header 
celtic need a win and they play kayal he's absolute shite !
fuck off kaka . i rate him but thats celtic done poor defending . 
kaka scoress for milan !! great goal from a great player .. <3 kaka
interesting making from celtic there
hate watching celtic there fucking pish !
gol do milan <33
celtic vs milan
i like that celtic park is now going into meltdown . another goal should do lovely .
it's like celtic go out their way to piss me off .....
celtic vs milan
goal ! celtic 0-1 ac milan ( kaka 13 ' ) that's double odds on 1st goalscorer bets on him ! 
kaka just scored for milan !!! i'm happy for that dude
milan player goes down , makes a meal of it , time wasting begins
big blow for milan
apart from that screamer of a corner , celtic look pretty good
fucking hate zonal marking 
kaka is a blessing to ac milan
me dads at the celtic match here , made sure he went in lonsdale slip on's and kappa tracky bottoms .
if kaka hadn't been there the other lad had a free header with marker trailing metres behind ! easiest goal milan will . ever score ...
sick a this biscuit tin mentality from the board !! fuck right off ! cunts !! 
not the best start celtic but 75 mins to go . could probs play 7 holes of golf in that time . 
kaka scores an easy header from a corner to give milan an early lead at celtic park : 0-1 ! 
gonna watch celtic vs milan , hope celtic can pull this one out and win
yes ! milan ac !!!
that is one of the worst pieces of defending i have ever seen , free header for kaka from 4 yards out . only milan player amongst 5 celtic
i hate ac milan
where d fuck was d marking 4d milan goal v celtic . absolute disgrace ud see better marking from a pub team . 2 of them queing up . 
kak√°'s last cl goal for ac milan had dated back to 6 november 2007 . his 29 career cl goals extend record by a brazilian in 
fuck sake celtic he was the only man in the danger area and didn't even need to jump .
milan have dominated so far but their passing has been a bit lazy
celtic don't do thereselves any favours with tifos like that ....
don't think celtic understand the concept of defending corners . 
love how rangers fans having nothing better to do than hope celtic get beat in europe
9 celtic defender's in the box . 8 of them defender's not marking a man . aye ns mark the space & we'll ball watch !! zonal marking zzzzzzzzzzz
if only inzaghi still played for milan ..
dislike milan but anyone against celtic is being cheered by me
( goal kaka !! )celtic-acm , livestreeming nobar 
blatant cheating from milan there
i hate celtic
wilshere has given arsenal 1-0 lead against marseille . kaka has put milan 1-0 up against celtic . ajax vs barca 0-0 , basel vs chelsea is 0-0 .
yes ac milan are winning . could be mega rich here !!!
kaka forever scoring against celtic
milan should just get d 3points for us please
keep it up milan
golll de ricardo kaka 
as if i needed more reasons to hate celtic .
celtic all mouth no trousers ..
come on celtic !
rangers fans clearly obsessed with celtic yet again tonight .
the boy ricardo getting it done for milan lets get it
boy on the post for celtic what were u going ?
kaka scored for milan by the way ... you've just got to love him ! <3
ac milan has scored away in scotland , they lead celtic 0-1 * 
celtic just loosing it all the time man
did a few of the celtic players have kaka first goal !!
this arsenl game is dead but im not watching chelsea or celtic so ill have to deal with this 
oh the celtic are shite !!!!
i thought swans were horrendous at defending set pieces ( and they are ) but my word , kaka's goal . take a bow celtic
fucking hell celtic wot kind of defending is that ! üò°üò¢
have that celtic
pissed off enough as it was because i missed the first 10 minutes then i get the fucking thing working and milan score ! fuck sake
celtic just conceded the worst goal imaginable . shocking piece of defending !!
that celtic defending was as horrendous as there pathetic support .
still trying to remember the last ucl goal milan scored through a header . maybe t silva's goal in the 2-2 draw at camp nou
good start for celtic !
celtic's banner was fucking horrible ! one more thing‚Ä¶ kakaaaaaaaa !!! 
0-1 milan - kaka with a rare headed goal from one of the worst defended corners you are ever likely to see .
fuck sake celtic
it's brilliant to see kaka in a milan shirt again , what a player .
haha celtic scum losing
go on milan , knock out " brave " celtic .
people say that it's bad defending from celtic in that corner but that's how fifa goals are made .
celtic and milan look as vulnerable as each other at the back , should be a few more goals here .
milan are winning , its all over
forza milan ! milan champion ! forza milan milan ole ... forza milan ! win for us ! forza milan the south and with you ! ale , ale , ale , ale ,
zonal marking , pfft , mrs galloway will tell you man marking is the way .e 
first time i have ever used the red button , trying to keep an eye on both celtic v ac milan and ajax v barcelona . 
i thought that we sucked at set-pieces .... wow celtic that was bad !!! 
why did i even put celtic on the docket üòí
uh-oh ... zonal marking alert ! dreadful goal for celtic to concede . going to be tough now .
i know i want celtic to win but kaka is an abs beast 
worst defending ever by celtic !
crosses a huge , huge weakness for forster . probably why he's still at celtic
so celtic go one down . i'm for a fun night 
nice of the celtic players to hand kaka such an easy chance to score from ....
celtic defense were more exposed that young james forrest after a night out in prestwick 
poor defending from celtic
well i am in so i guess it's or maybe for me tonight
sat my arse down 15 mins into game , just in time for milan to score , game off
come on celtic
let's the kaka's goal wouldn't be followed by another goal from celtic like the one in the calcio
bollix anyway !!! 
both celtic and napoli losing qq
hearing kaka has scored a header from a corner at celtic - cant be true ...
he is taking milan . carrying them . he is gonna put them where they belong . guess who is back bitches . kaka !!!!!
i‚Äôm sorry celtic - but you wouldn‚Äôt see any premiership defence be that statuesque at a corner .
made that too easy for they cunts there , c'mon celtic !!
not messing here .. but if we went to parkhead and played celtic .. i reckon we'd win about 3-0
celtic sort your bloody marking out . c'mon bhoys we can do this .
that marking though celtic
allan johnston looking as suave as ever on the milan touchline .
ac milan picking up this win forsure üòç
the pain of wilshere scoring having taken him out of my dream team is eased slightly by celtic losing . 
i hate commentators , they all just hate milan . guy almost broke abate's ankle " oh seems like nothing too serious " ma stfu .
is the ac milan player dead ?
98 goals for milan kaka only 2 more buddy
that could possibly be the worst bit of defending i've ever seen 6 celtic players in 6 yard box and one milan player and they concede !
i'm not a milan fan by any means , but i adore the fact that kaka is returning to old form .
need ac milan and arsenal then man city for 172 quid !! come on
this is kaka's 98th goal for milan right ?
awesome defending , celtic .
i wonder if there is the same " i thought someone had it " attitude when the players collect their wages embarrassing defending celtic
go ac milan 1 0 #22 
that's kaka's 98th goal for ac milan , his third against celtic .
if celtic lose today gonna be doing backflips down the road !!
celtic fans glorifying bobby sands again ? dearie me .
get in there !!!! goal for milan . always loved kaka :-)
get behind team ya wasters ! 3-1 t√¶ the celtic !
bastarbs come on celtic
are you shitting me celtic
lol always too excited during champions league , only to be parred ..
wait , did milan really score from a set piece ? i guess i'm in a dream .
fancied celtic strongly tonight . come in from feeding the old girls and they are down already 
interesting new tactic by celtic . let's not bother marking anyone at corners . not as if they're going to score .
you won't find bigger hypocrits than celtic fans . fucking scum .
milan 1-0 celtics .
dortmund 1-0 arsenal 1-0 milan 1-0 and there we have fc porto 0-1 ...
unforgivable . woeful from forster and van dijk . 
kaka back to carrying milan again
celtic ... get fuckin oot , seek oh you's and your fans thinking you's are brilliant cause you's bate barca at home . 
kaka-oaaallll ! ac milan lead at celtic park . it's goals on goals early today ! 
not being anti-celtic here but shows how poor they are & worse still year after year they walk away with league . maybe part of the problem .
arsenal & milan winning too and vienna
kaka shouldn't have left milan in the first place . mourinho totally fucked him over .
i knew as soon as i left milan would have scored . fuck off football
that goal puts back in control of second place in the group . if barcelona beat ajax , they'll go through tonight . 
celtic are crap . kaka of 2013 shouldn't be scoring against anyone .
milan have started the time wasting fairly early .... 1-0 ... there's a m.a.s.h. unit on the park .. lad has broken his fingernail
woooo let's go milan
celtic are horrendous at defence nowadays , a mind when celtic got a corner it was as good as a penalty , shiteee .
thoughts so far : losing a header to kayal is embrassing . kayal should be shot for that miss . 
i don't celtic winning this match against milan
yh man . milan runs through ma blood 
sigh , celtic !
celtic are going out üëã
when brian is begging u to turn on the celtic match and his reason is to get pumped for turners cross on friday ! " üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÖüòÖüòÖ
fuck englishman celtic
absolutely disgusting defending from celtic for kaka's goal ... is it difficult to mark someone who isn't moving ?
kaka scored for milan v celtic . theres something special about kaka in a milan shirt . 
celtic's defending from that corner made county's defending from cross balls look solid .
unbelievable celtic , pretty sure i made the fatal error of including a celtic win in every single one of my bets
dear celtic fc : no victor wanyama , no champions league victory , get it ?
the goal celtic conceded was so bad , never seen a corner defended so shit üòÇ
lustig for celtic is fucking quality !
i have a real dislike for ac milan !
provan complimentary about rogic's closing down of milan . 
celtic are well gay
milan are rangers in disguise wan ten
goaaaal milan !!
celtic are going to have to come from behind if they want any chance of going through to the last 16 
kaka keeps scoring for milan he's the man in italy
if this is the famous celtic european atmosphere .... well ict fans we may not be so bad after all !
im watching milan just to see the beast and the most ballon d'ors bonera üôàüôà
kaka still scoring in the cl for ac milan-a feeling of dejavu . what a legend ... 
hahaha ! fuck off celtic !
anyone got a link that will work on a phone ? 
milan will crumble 
kaka scores bare goals for milan una . rasta should never have gon real madrid
 celtic - milan ac
ac lmao sorry i mean milan up by 1 . kaka .
celtic park is basically empty for league games and is suddenly full for champions league 
wow everyone started all aggressive . dortmund winning . arsenal winning and milan winning .
celtic fans are scumbag bastards
kaka , probably milans best player this season , gives ac the lead against celtic . 1-0
celtic are so open at the back , it's hard to see anything other than 3-0 or worse
the celtic defending for that kaka goal was embarrassing üôà
solid marking on that corner there celtic
gonna watch milan and the ex city lads .
arsenal , dortmund , & milan - to no surprise - all with early leads . 
kaka matched at a high of 11 , as his early goal has given milan the lead at celtic . marco reus matched at 7.8 has given an early lead .
bloody hell celtic . junior clarets under 12s would have done better there . and we use to lose 17-0
that's the first ' meeelan ' player actin as if he'd been shot this evenin 
come on celtic üçÄ
commentators commenting on milan - ultras stand off
but celtic defence opened up there
milan that shite we've give them a head start ktf üçÄüòúüòùüòé
and milan are rolling around like they've been shot already
first goal in ucl with milan since 2007 , just to make that clear .
celtic do have time to bring it back in all fairness
two sitters missed . how many more of those will we get ? 
milan are goin to score again
kaka on the score sheet for ac milan
some cunt is needing to tell big foster that he can come off his line . come in celtic get into them
if celtic can't turn it around i hope the concede another 3 or 4 just to see there faces
first bet goes up in smoke .. had to be celtic too !
tell ya celtic better get there defending uncontrol or we can kiss good bye to the champions league !!
canny believe a actually bet they useless bastards celtic fuck knows whit am thinkin man
okay : let's go : celtic , basel , and dortmund
that was an appalling goal to concede . defence standing ball watching ! celtic need to get their collective fingers out
forster not exactly covering himself in glory with that kaka goal 
ac milan are a shadow of the team 3-4 years ago
come on ac hope they take 4 or 5 off celtic
this is an average milan team at best
celtic inviting milan to counter-attack . too many players pushing up at the wrong time and leaving a space behind .
here come all the fake milan fans üòù 
sorry but charlie mulgrew at this level is a man down . prove me wrong charlie . 
ah no what a stupid goal to give away . 
tv in my room is broken so im being made sat through this celtic match with my dad 
the only decent thing about this milan season so far is having kaka back . truly a milan legend
celtic and zonal marking , probably the worst combination iv ever heard of üòÇ
yessss milan . nice start üëå 
at celtic park ... c'mon celtic
forgot balotelli played for milan
glad to see kaka getting playing time back at milan 
milan are getting so much time on the ball at points , celtic have bottled it i think
how ledley doesn't get a game for celtic is beyond me
i can't believe how many bears i see tweeting about watching the celtic game . why would you even bother watching ?
yes get in milan ! 
anyone any links for the match ?
terrible defending celtic !! " unbelievable jock !"
wow . celtic is already losing . :/
i love kaka . fuck off celtic 
poor goal ... coybig !!!
3 goals in europe against celtic 
milan wouldn't stand a chance in the champions league and the serie a without kaka , grande ricky !
shockin by celtic 
forza milan and weednesday :d
milan all the way !!!
i have to say , of all the european games i've watched celtic play . that has got to be one of the worst goals i've seen celtic lose .
celtic are working so hard , hope it pays off before they get tired
cummon celtic , plz don't let me down .. will feel bad if they lose and i don't even support them ... cummon u hoops
just as i stick a tenner on celtic milan score . this is why i stopped gambling 
i cant see the ac milan game cause of sorry as barca > . <
struggling to find form and fan pressure mounting ? injury crisis making your job harder ? you need a game against charity minded celtic fc !
the defending at the goal proves we don't deserve to be in this competition . 
celtic want to smash balotelli hahahah
i don't see celtic winning against milan tonight
keep at it celtic
that wasn't just a gift from celtic . that was international aid .
milan are going to tear a celtic a new one here
watching kaka play again in milan is such a joy , just brings out all those games you watched in childhood . joga bonito .
looks like celtic goes to the max allegri school of set piece defending . ;) -gc
kaka goal v celtic lol worst defending ive ever seen haha 
 : goal : celtic 0-1 ac milan . ( kaka )
overwhelming urge to judas my maw after seeing celtic chuck this already
watching the ac milan v celtic game .
i don't know which match to watch ... celtic ac is tasty but arsenal are so good to watch
kaka is on absolute fire for ac milan !! yessss
the only reason i want milan to win : ricardo kaka .
kaka 1x0 celtic #ŸÅÿßŸàŸÑ_ÿ´Ÿàÿ®
kaka only 2 goals away from a century for milan :') 
17 ' another corner for milan , hasil skill individu balotelli tadi

why isnt the barca game on tv and fuck you celtic omgg
wish i can watch match ..... 
still in this . could use a goal soon though . and to not concede 
i hope celtic get raped !!!
the dutchman hardly touched the current milan player laying on the ground apparently dying of a gunshot wound .
wtf celtic .
come on milan
kaka is putting milan onto his shoulders this season . no wonder theyre struggling , the man is the only one playing .
didn't quite get up in time to watch it live , but come on celtic ! 
rangers fans make fun of celtic when the opposition score and celtic fans don't do it to rangers because they don't pay attention to league1
goal ! celtic 0 , milan 1 . kak√° ( milan ) header from very close range . assisted by valter birsa with a cross following a corner . ha fucken ha
early goals across 4 games in the arsenal , milan and dortmund lead in their respective games !
merry xmas there's a free goal 
celtic football club . ashamed of nothing . offended by everything .
come on celtic get a grip
bad news for milan , ajax has scored against barcelona .
get in there kaka fuck celtic
yas milan , really need this line to come up tonight
wish i could be watching milan though . every other game is on but my team . fuck 
 ‚Äì goal alert : celtic 0-1 * ac milan *( kaka 13 ‚Äô) 
only took ac milan 16 minutes to start time wasting 
only watching the milan match because of kaka
üì∫ ac milan x celtic
celtic nice one
and milan just scored lets goooo
while it was a great cross and header - terrible defending by celtic 
in milan's group : ajax 1-0 barcelona 
honestly it's not just because i hate them , celtic's players stupidity and lack of talent amazes me every time i see them
milan , dortmund , arsenal have scored faster than i thought today
if celtic lose tonight i wouldnae fancy bein the next team to play them , can see a hiding being handed out to someone :-d
sevco fans tweet more about celtic than about their own team haha
haha my dads laugh once he seen celtic were losing was brilliant haha
kaka is one of the most respected players in my opinion and now that he's just scored against celtic adds the icing on the cake
 goal alerts celtic 0 - 1 ac milan dortmund 1 - 0 napoli fc porto 1- 0 austria wien arsenal 1 - 0 marseille hit like for next updates
that wasn't fair , the celtic lads were having a game of musical statues and kaka blatantly cheated :)
celtic glasgow 0-1 ac milan . 
if celtic lose tonight then there will be alot of folk saying haha you lost then celtic fans will start saying 1st division
just read that a player called virgil van dijk plays for celtic . that is the greatest name you'll ever read . 
celtic moan about rangers fans cheering for the opposition or slagging them off , let's be honest football would be shit if it didn't happen
" kaka has stunned celtic park with a header to give ac milan a 1-0 lead . "
thought joey essex was in the jungle ? he's no . 11 for celtic the night
horrendous defending from celtic from the corner to let kaka tap in a simple header
in my 32 years making sweeping hyperbolic statements about celtic , that's the cheapest goal we've ever conceded .
corner milan ... hope boerrigter is on kaka .... they've gone short .. must have had a memory lapse . cleared ... 1-0 milan 19mins gone
kaka gave milan the visitors a one goal lead with a free header from a corner 
typical ... this celtic side is just not good enough for this level - hope you're all rt this when we win 3-1 or something . 
19 balotelli wins his side another corner but milan take it short and celtic eventually clear through ambrose .
serero puts ajax ahead to respond to milan
sssshhhhh celtic park 
celtic lol
that's the worst goal i've ever seen in the champions league , schoolboy defending for celtic
i bet it was some reject from the apprentice who came up with the idea for zonal marking during a ' brainstorming ' session . 
1-0 ajax . serrero with a neat finish from close range . not celtic's night so far
funny how i can't see any celtic fans tweeting
ricardo kak√† being the main man for ac milan yet again . maestro !
that's a shocking goal for celtic to lose , u13s at the racecourse defending right there .
milan is where i belong i'll let u know that now
. leg is still kinda hurting from the minor car crash whilst leaving milan . gods grace is so sufficient though . he is always with me .
hopefully kak√° will be picked for the world cup , on a great run for milan ! ‚öΩÔ∏è
honestly what are celtic doing there for the goal ? not one player marking anyone ? zonal marking should be abolished its pathetic .
milan takes the lead
and now barca is down another good sign for milan . but can ajax hold it ?
milan have world class players and their 13th . shocking in the league
milan's train station must be one of the noisiest places on earth
for fuck sake celtic terrible defending
come on ac milan :)
celtic will come back
goool ! del milan !!! :d lml
cooom da fuck ooooooon celtic
comeon milan .
celtic 1-0 down already :p happy wae that !!!
that buzzin feeling i had is gone . shite celtic , get a grip .
kaka score for milan against celtic as rues score for the penalty spot to give dortmund the lead against napoli ..... ucl update 20mins played
i can't help but love balliotelli even tho he's against celtic tonight
go 
celtic defend a corner terribly and let a goal in , the next milan corner goes short . anyone could understand why that's wrong
balotelli has grown up so much since going to milan
fuck coupons btw , everywan hinking celtic wid win the night boom 1-0 down early on so unpredicatable
milan 1 celtic o
if milan wins barca qualify without drawing neither winning against ajax :)
need 2 goals -_- c'mon celtic ! 
let's all laugh at celtic
right on cue‚Ä¶ajax get a huge goal as they look to keep pace with milan . 
boom !!! celtic one(1 ) up against barca
goooalll with a header ! 1-0 over .
i love stahr milan though .
so we didn't learn anything from sat then naw .. come 2fcuk celtic .
i tell a lie . i didn't put chelsea on i did milan . who are 1 nil up already :-)
#3reasonstonotplaymeinfifa psg , ac milan and france
ac milan are on a mad ting .
so a quiet night in and take-away with dean turned into ... dean getting a ticket too watch celtic in glasgow and me tucked up on my own .. üòí
33 seconds ? there are times i wish wiltshire played for celtic rather than arsenal
yass milan get in there
kaka's playing sick for milan 
chin up celtic
good luck milan
kaka shining at milan ..... ion run for your life mata
ffs celtic , do it the hard way , puss poor defending
throw everything at them celtic 
in my milan side balotelli would have carried bags for players such as marco van basten , george weah and andriy shevchenko- zvonimir boban
the stuff ma dad hits out with when hes watchin celtic is unreal man hahaha
there's shocking defending and then there's that .... 
christina's celtic kitchen-chestnut dressing . visit the editorial page of the catoosa dispatch for the complete recipe .
united fans seem to be an easy target on here these days , probably cause everyone else with an opinion " supports " celtic or dundee
kaka ' and honda as free transfers will likely be galliani's last great moves as milan's amministratore delegato
goals like that are specifically saved for karma coming back to celtic fans who belittle you and your " rubbish wee team and club "
this milan team are still shite , we'll score
my predictions- chelsea 3-0 basel arsenal 2-1 marseille celtic 1-3 ac milan borrusia dortmund 1-1 napoli
kaka has scored against celtic . milan up 1-0
c'mon 
terrible marking from celtic for kaka's goal
sevco fans tweet more about celtic than they do about their own team ahah 2 
if you thought celtic's marking was bad , serero just walked completely unmarked into the box to slot home for ajax . too easy
win or lose i will always love you‚ù§Ô∏è forza milan ‚úåÔ∏è
celtic 0-1 ac milan not gd news for us jambos re sunday celtic must get a result in the young team
only thing i'm enjoying about watching the celtic game is seeing balotelli ! missed watching him every weekend . üò¨üôå
kakaaaaaa <3 sempre lui contro il celtic 
dundee united fans kick the arse out everything saying celtic are shite cause one of the best teams in the worlds scored against them
celtic letting me down so far for ¬£80
celtic in europe are stressful !
my scenario is going half as i predicted . ajax to get the draw , and milan should get a draw any time soon .
kaka just needed to be in an environment where is he is loved , depended on and given a chance 
celtic's stadium has got the best atmosphere
oooooo ajax scored ! celtic have it all to do now
what shit marking celtic ....
although we conceded a goal , it also means ac milan need to step it up !
 is also on score sheet for milan ...
who gives a flying one about celtic ? river city is on ! 
grupo h - no momento : barcelona 10 pts milan 8 pts ajax 7 pts celtic 3 pts
ajax beating barca i now declare celtic fucked yas boys
for a team with as little skill as celtic they should at least be well drilled and good at defending set pieces 
for kaka class is permanent . he's bin the saving grace for milan so far 
in my house chelsea vs basel game on tv , ajax vs barcelona and bvb vs napoli on the comp and celtic vs ac and arsenal vs marseille on laptop
celtic vs ac milan üçÄ
goal ! 19 ' ajax 1-0 barcelona - thulani surero ! wow this would set up a fantastic showdown in group h with milan if these results hold . 
so that was money well spent on virgil van dyke 
come on celtic !
oh no ajax scored against barca ! :( milan is in trouble if they beat barca ! :(
the entire ac milan team now wouldnt get on the reserves a couple of years ago 
wether you rate him or no celtic aren't even half the team without scott brown !!
milan's goalkeeper looks like dr evil
the green brigade are demented , and celtic do nothing to discourage them .
just 7 celtic players & kaka inside the 6 yard box !!!! kaka didn't move or jump & celtic chasing the game already
milan 1 up ! it's on like cooked crack ! who else but kaka !
milan playing better than they did in milan , but they probably didn't expect the free goal .
this milan team are fucking shocking as well .
i'm guessing brave ( so very brave ) celtic were expecting brave ( so very brave ) john kennedy to mark kaka ?
we are hosting a trip to celtic manor ice skating rink followed by a mc donalds ! letters available thursday from the attik !
fuck watching arsenal match ! milan's one is more interesting
barca down milan up
is it 0-1 milan ye ..........
wat the hell there not show in the milan match üò§üò§üò©
celtic are turd
i hate milan but kaka is quality
ohh ffs celtic
celtic fans only turn up for champions league nights
i can't watch when milan are on the attack
know how you were feeling bad abot the score ? well ajax are leading 1-0 now ... that ain't going to help .. 0-1 milan 20mins away
classic aarron corner defending from celtic
a goal for south african serero as ajax look to catch ac milan in 2nd place who incidently are also winning away at celtic . 1-0
samaras through the middle in a game you need to win reminds me of levein's famous 4-6-0 , just seems pointless , come on celtic !
didn't know there was so many glaswegian ac milan fans ....
i can't wait for to come back . i think he's exactly what need to get them ticking again .
i hope celtic get stomped by ac milan tonight 1-0 early
milan leads 1:0 in glasgow scored by 
 ........ bailing from trouble since 2004
kaka has been on fire since going back to milan swear down
they don't even play milan games in hd anymore :"(
it would be great if celtic was a good team
if the scores stay the same celtic are , in a very real sense , oot .
c'mon celtic‚òë 
milan and ajax are fighting over second place in group h , and both have taken 1-0 leads over celtic and barcelona , respectively .
kaka gives ac milan the lead in scotland
some amount if people say celtic fans are obsessed then spend all their time tweeting about celtic . baffling .
bam ajax strikes first . woahh this is bad for milan ...
celtic , always play well against big teams , but they always lose !
celtic 1-0 down

alitalia rebuffs ryanair collaboration offer : milan ( reuters ) - cash-strapped alitalia rebuffed on tuesday an offer from low-cost air ...
basketball style defending didn't help celtic much with kaka's goal tonight .

alitalia rebuffs ryanair collaboration offer : milan ( reuters ) - cash-strapped alitalia rebuffed on tuesday an offer from low-cost air ...
3 - kak√° has now scored his 3rd goal vs celtic , only vs anderlecht has he netted more in the champions league . present . "
game has went really flat , this suits milan , we need a corner or a goal
arsenal up , dortmund up and celtic down . so far , so good .
we're 20mins in and the goal has been the only real action so far , celtic have been bright but wasteful up front . 20 ' 
james forrest just nutmegged kaka there like it was nothing 
i'm glad to see kaka's scoring again now he's back in milan
 : 1-barcelona 10 pts . 2-milan 8 pts . 3-ajax 7 pts . 4-celtic 3 pts .
birsa and emanuelson show how far milan have fallen ! 
oh no celtic
this wasn't quite how celtic , losing 1-0 to a kak√° goal , had hoped the night would go .
but i need barca to win this game and milan to win at celtic !!
so much win in my room right now ... celtic game on my laptop , arsenal game on my tv 
just seen celtic are 1 down against ac milan . lovely .
i dont even want to watch barca play anymore , milan is winning and i cant fucking watch it !
kaka love scoring on celtic
this has to be 1 of the worst milan teams in recent history , couldny pass an eye test but at 6/4 i'll take them !
ajax beating barca , no europe for celtic
kaka scores . celtic loses cleansheet . fuckers . - . - 
of all the celtic track suits/jackets at neil lennon's disposal why does he wear such a jakey looking one . 
kaka with the goal for milan
celtic fans are deadly .. üçÄ
milan are there to be had but we are so toothless up front . can't remember such an impotent celtic team . early 90s perhaps .
kudos to my guy kaka ......... he just don't deserve to be in a big for nothing club like milan
kaka scores gooollll celtic 0 milan 1 it's feels good to see kaka scoring üòå
if i'm rich i wanna be like cesar milan . he's the one who make me feels that dog is so loving . and help me to en-counter stuff .
celtic not good enough to go any further in this group
that celtic goal tho ‚ô•
celtic are taking the piss
don't think i've seen a worse team at passing the ball than this current celtic team .
ajax scores , bad news for milan fans
celtic with the deed man flags on show
one celtic goal please
it's a celtic woman kind of day .
let's watch milan . more interesting
brilliant start to night , celtic bet settled . just awaiting the net to bulge at spotland .
come on celtic fs !!!
kaka has been a nobody for about 2 years now .. when does he decide to announce himself back on the european stage ? against celtic obviously .
celtic losing & ajax winning , no no . this means celtic won't even get europa league
i love watching celtic if united aren't playing . you know you're guaranteed to see a decent game
barca will still win and hopefully celtic
 understands where milan has been and where it is headed . 
and kak√° scored for ac milan , that's just spot on
celtic park where the atmosphere is at ..... silenceeeee
i like the ajax team . very exciting and promising . i want them to go through ahead of that yeye milan team .
if forrest scores he should run er to the corner flag and helicopter his cock at the milan fans
nutmegging a milan player then passing the ball straight to the opposition under absolutely zero pressure . sums up forrest's career so far .
good to see celtic fans mixing up someone who raised an army and had a battle with another army and cunts who blew up woman and kids .
mon the milan !
fuck some overrated piece of shit scored for ax milan . haway celtic
celtic is a good team .
milan sit back , take the pressure and hit the duds on the counter attack 
as it stands celtic are dropping out of europe all together
not a problem we just need 2goals now ,, poor poor goal to gift milan but cfc looking very capable 
can you imagine where milan would be without kaka'? boy was i wrong about him 
goal ! celtic 0-1 ac milan : who else but ac captain kaka , scoring for fun at the moment , he's given the italians the lead .
a little more direct play from milan would tear this lethargic celtic defence apart . the same can be said for milan's defend i guess .
celtic arent a patch on harry's holiday campers back in the portsmouth jolly up days . losing to milan already ....
milan leading 1-0 at celtic park . no big deal .
come on celtic !!!!!
just got worse for celtic üòÇ
kaka's really at home with milan .
good start with dortmund and milan scoring early ! 15
celtic are done now
curious to know what celtic and celtic fans value james forrest at ?... #¬£¬£ ¬£590 ono
i should be at celtic park tonight for the ac milan game üòí 
milan are a fucking pub team at best . fuck them . celtic to win 2-1 .

hate having no im a celeb cause of silly football , but the fact celtic are down one nil as of now makes it a little better ‚öΩÔ∏è
hate celtic
the only way tonight could get any worse for celtic is if ajax were to score ..... oh wait !
kaka couldn't have made a better career choice . scores goals for fun since he moved to san siro . 
much more balanced game now for milan . i like to see this . keep it up !
12 minutes in to the game & milan have scored ! watch out celtic i think theres a possibility that your getting your ass kicked tonigh
fuck this game i wanna watch milan
sami breaks .. but wants about 23 extra touches .... milan clear .. quite an exciting game this . no way it is finishing 1-0 . not . a . chance .
my bros like bye and i follow him downstairs and ask where u goin and he's like milan with all his suitcases packed ok kl
plspls celtic win !
20 mins in , celtic losing , barca losing , porto losing .... fuck fitba coupons 
real madrid nearly ruined kaka's career , he is back at ac milan and banging in goals
love that to get on the wifi in milan linate airport , you need a password that you can't get to because they send it via email 
" milan and ajax are fighting over second place in group h , and both have taken 1-0 leads over celtic and barcelona , respectively ."
come on milan 
celtic come again , van dijk well done , celtic have it wide right , izzy , good cross , to¬†boerrigter
c'mon celtic settle down no more mistakes please üôè
this team is bobbins ‚öΩÔ∏èüëé
ajax leading barca which means as it stands celtic are out of europe all together .
ooh and kaka has a lead against celtic . awesome .
oooh barcelona 1-0 down . getting worse for .
gif : kaka puts ac milan ahead at celtic ! watch >>>
kaka's the captain of milan ?
lustig is brilliant , celtic best player is thing üòÅ
canny stand burds that think theyre celtic casuals
i wonder how long before james forrest gets " pulled off " tonight ?? 
nae chance of celtic going through now 
20 mins gone , teams who are leading arsenal 1-0 bvb 1-0 0-1 austria ajax 1-0 0-1 ac milan 
are we playing ac or uefa milan the night 
milan score an easy goal from a corner . then they get another corner and take it short n end up at the half way line ? 
c'mon celtic mann
when i was at celtic-aberdeen game on saturday and the aberdeen fans thought it was funny to shout ajax and wreck the toilets ! get a grip . üò°
this game won't finnish 1-0 .. celtic will score atleast once
keep calm and always fight . celtic 0-1 milan . goal kaka 
have a feelin celtic are gonna lose
i think barca might just throw this away just so that they've done what they can to dispose of milan .
 players playing too far apart from each other forcing long passes 
celtic really are just scum
rt this is one of those magic nights in paradise . can you feel it ? 
hope celtic win this
kaka has been amazing since coming back to milan !
c'mon milan score the 2nd one as well .
celtic are a fucking pub team , motherwell would destroy this mob
celtic in the champions league always look terrified to take a shot any further than about 3 yards from goal . 
c'mon ac 
 went back to ac milan on a free .... 58million they sold him for ! 
in other news ajax beating barcelona , do celtic really still have to go to the nou camp ??
milan goal taken crowd vocal support down a few notches . c'mon the honey nut loops . chances are their to be taken in this encounter .
i actually love the way celtic play
come on celtic !!
celtic are so entertaining to watch
come on celtic
the problem with zonal marking is that spaces don't score goals , players do . 
group h takes another twist as thulani serero blasts ajax into the lead against barcelona . 
i still can't believe milan is in 13th place ..
celtic playing ball tho .... 
flicking between the celtic and arsenal match and the difference in the match atmosphere is crazy . celtic fans best in the world
celtic are no ged without scott brown
ricky kaka made it yeahhh . puts milan 1-0 right now
celtic we will take the cormer
since she's on her own shit today , ima kick it with milan .
c'mon celtic </3
the current scores are terrible news for celtic . obviously , this is great .
come on celtic !
mon t'fuck celtic get a goal from this
c'mon celtic !
ajax/vienna/milan winning , 3 of my predictions up the shitter in the first 20 minutes
why is stv not showing tonight's celtic game seeing as it's a tuesday ?
ac milan is home for kaka

c'mon celtic
celtic building a bit of pressure here .
celtic are playing outstanding
love how all these die hard celtic fans appear on champions league night eh

bonera was shite seven years ago . incredible that he's still on milan's books , let alone starting an important champions league game .
this is when i enjoy watching celtic . they're fighting for this !
bonera not trolling milan since today
 ( as opposed to lightness , milan kundera's term )
for what it's worth , milan should win today ..... for football's sake
quite a big fan of celtic
pulling such a thanksgiving move watching the celtic v . milan game at my internship 
celtic are really going for it tonight !
i hate celtic
celtic playing some lovely football 
celtic working the ball very well here , brilliant play , lustig wins a corner
really want celtic to win !
celtic are on form the night
my spainish bro will say hala milan nd i'll forza madrid ...
get in ajax ! celtic cl looks over !
 forrest get yer finger out 
i'm getting feelings of 3-2 celtic . fuck knows where from .
celtic in some pretty deepshit right now
annoying that i can't see this n have to settle for ac/celtic . least it entertaining
like he's legit just walked out and he's going to fly to milan rn
passing letting celtic down in all areas of the pitch
if ajax win they won't be praised as much as celtic but they should be praised 100x as much as celtic
even if celtic won't advance to next round , have to applaud their fantastic fans . great atmosphere
hi i would hate celtic too aye
bonera is everywhere on defense right now for milan
the bet isn't looking too bad at the minute . need celtic to win though , that's probably gonna screw me .
playing well , playing well . let's keep it up 
kaka loves breaking celtic hearts .
can't see celtic doing any fin the night
celtic vs ac milan üëåüëå them on my way ! out
hot off the press , " the fix is in " for milan . barbara doesn't wield that sort of influence
celtic fans always say there the better team but at the end of the day , they never win so haha to yous üòÇ
the most creative players for celtic are the two centre halves . haven't seen anything like this since freddie van der hoorn at utd 
if the scores stay the same celtic are out of europe hahaha
this celtic fan is making me laugh everytime samaras gets the ball he shouts " come on sammmyy "
just checked my snapchats , 23 snaps about celtic üíöüçÄ
ajax v barca and celtic v milan are the best games on today by far
do ajax could do something , too bad celtic and napoli are shit .
celtic settling and looking a bit better . but of course , soaking up the pressure is italian fitba . that goal was ridiculous
celtic are on this ting
i have respect to celtic though for beating barcelona that time
ajax with an early goal , celtic down 1 to milan , blues are tied at 0's .
i don't want to watch celtic or chelsea why can't i watch barcelona
wee dirk appears to be in milan's pocket . or maybe sock .
corner . c'mon celtic bury this
what celtic really lack is a creative midfielder who can unlock defences with a pass .
bitter , bitter celtic fans , rangers fans are '' obsessed '' because we laughed at celtics awful defending there hahaha
ajax beatinhg barcelona 1-0 and celtics beating ac milan 1-0 tight group
is the celtic left back called boa constrictor
i don't understand football at all . how are celtic in the champions league ?
22 ' corner kick for celtic 
c'mon celticüçÄüçÄ‚ù§
come on celtic
this celtic vs ac game is pace
celtic with there poor crosses , sheesh !
is the milan keeper playing volleyball ? fuck me catch the fucking thing .
celtic running at dese men cruel
ill consider celtic a top club when they win the champions league
im gonna go off twitter till about half 9 so i dont have to listen to " if celtic this " and " if celtic that " sorry but ' mon milan ! ;d
that was a pretty easy goal for celtic to let in tbh
celtic are in real need of a creative midfielder , a real number 10
celtic supporters must wish kaka would leave them alone
goals are raining in the champions league ! bvb , gunners , ajax , milan
milan have no fight about them . we need to set about these cunts !
i'm pretty sure neil lennon sleeps in that celtic trackie ...
waaay celtic , ac's too good
that milan keeper is a fucking mentalist
gets home finds out reus and kaka scores ^0^ yes !! milan and dortmund winning (:
just what kaka deserves ! honestly glad he went back to milan 
good game this celtic and milan !! good choice to watch this one very open
kaka give ac milan the lead at celtic . welldone kaka

kaka with a goal for milan üëåüíôüòÅ
22 ' corner kick for celtic 
kaka has been amazing since coming back to milan

bruh unexpected results tonight ... thank god fr ac milan tho ‚ò∫
awww man that's a harsh goal for celtic , they were actually playin pretty well there !
everyone should watch the celtic game . end to end stuff !
anyone fancy talking me through why celtic's got a banner of a terrorist on show the night ? actually canny make this shit up .
even farr united at their worst could defend a corner better than celtic did there .
james forrest looks like a handy player for celtic .
celtic fans love a banner
interesting match ac milan . vs celtic
interesting match ac milan . vs celtic
celtic are playing great !! except for the goal :(((
just flicked the channel to see milan . kaka is his old brilliant self . making smart passes and driving the defenders crazy hahaha . 
any chance of flabbiati catching that round white thing ?! lunatic . 
 - barsa .. - milan ..
c'mon celtic keep up the pressure !
standard of celtic crossing v poor
celtic 1 down , ajax one up # doomeddddd
this is some slick football from celtic .
whatever they did ( or are still doing ) to kaka in the milan laboratories that madrid doctors couldn't is still very much beyond me
celtic will score at least once tonight .
my timeline is not a happy one 
wasnt too bothered about celtic conceding till ajax went 1 up
' as it stands celtic are going out and that is not good news for celtic fans ' compelling stuff sky sports news , i am riveted
milan got out quick as fuck there ! we need to be more like that 
where have all these celtic fans come from 
3 hour layover only means a cheeky pint and the ac milan match ‚öΩÔ∏èüç∫‚úàÔ∏è
rangers were playing at arbroath this week . celtic playing milan . how we've fallen .
celtic wicked yes
all top4 matches being played tonight are at 1-0 apiece in less than 20mins .... with arsenal , ajax , dortmund , ac milan smiling at the moment
milan will do what juve done . sit deep and then score another couple on the break . then celtic fans will cry about how much better they were
ajax beating barca too ! celtic are fucked
ac are making celtic play to the corners as they know we don't have anyone that will attack it . we can put 100 balls in there and not score .
come on celtic ..
c'mon celtic . you better not be the one that let's me down for 600 quid .
i hope turn over , it would be good 4 , & if beat then celtic wil jump frm 4th into 2nd 
absolutely hate milan 
every professional player will tell you celtic park is hell to play at .
love me a kopparberg . not had one in so long , makes watching the celtic game worth it !
kaka loves scoring against celtic . 
we've got one player who doesn't want to show himself and another who has just been lifted for showing himself ! 
celtic corner .... gone short ... boerrigter through ... offside . good flag , unfortunately . 0-1 milan .... this has got 2-2 all over it
kaka is the only inform milan player so far ds season .. always scoring against celtic !!!
watching celtic v . milan on a snowy day 
not sure if celtic fans or dortmund fans .. those banners are insane !
celtic out if it stays like this üëç
that's face it celtic fans wouldn't have wanted anyone else but kaka to score against them
i don't which is worse torture watching celtic and milan or doing my assignment .
this milan game is very entertaining actually
lol celticüòÇ
watching the celtic - milan game cuz the crowd is just fantastic
celtic play so well on champions league nights !! fuck being an away team in parkhead as well !! still hope they get humped
never seen defending as bad as celtic's for that goal . zonal marking needs to die a death , just doesn't work
come on celtic we can do this . üçÄüçÄüçÄ
oh , well if my website isn't working i can always use this time to check up on how celtic are getting on . what ? they're losing ? 
the amount of times celtic players crosses hit the first man is embarrassing .
milan win , ajax win , and that section in the glitterdome to crumble , what a tuesday that would be .
van dijk & ambrose are the best at going forward with the ball in the celtic team and they're the two centre backs
come on celtic !!
wow milan winning and barca losing , if only the game was 30 min long ....
ajax beating barca , bye bye celtic
yeah , couch , blazing fire , feet up and football . 
celtic have bottled it !! 
ajax milan and arsenal up good times :)
come on celtic !!
celtic are scum
lets go celtic , milan are a bunch of overrated scrubs !
anyone got a link to a radio commentary of celtic ?
having to steam the milan game because i'm watching arsenal and there is a person in the chat box called " rangersdiedhahaha1 "
come on celtic !
these english commentators on espn are ridiculous , still needed a replay to see half dozen celtic players were offside .
as part of new scottish passport everyone has to pick either celtic or rangers 
milan laying system going well - send more money ..... 
i love the silver that forster is wearing but not very effective for a ' keeper eh ? 
celtic have played really well , they don't deserve to be behind .
hate celtic so much
anna : i don't care when or where bit next time celtic thunder comes through saskatchewan i will be at that show !!
watching celtic play at home is always a great thing .
hate celtic but their fans are class
why cant celtic fans just bring football related banners , its like a political protest
kaka has scored for milan at celtic , reus penalty has put dortmund 1-0 up v napoli . 
will signor kaka resuscitate the flat - lined ac milan ?
nothing is going for milan this season , they need ajax to lose to qualify . ajax lead .
such a bad way to start break . celtic are losing and i can't even watch it because it's not on tv
forza magico milan 
why is georgios samaras the captain of celtic football club ?
kaka just doesn't fail to disappoint in milan colours . not then , not now .
celtic fans really are pure scumbags
celtic re really impressing
very poor defending by celtic on the goal though no one anywhere near kaka
celtic playing very good on the wings
city fans watching the ' legend ' they used to have on the back of their shirts in the celtic/milan game . no not kaka ...... samaras . 
vienna gets it's 1st champs league goal , serero scores against barca , kaka puts milan ahead and dortmund back on track . good night so far .
celtic - milan , the two teams i reasonlessly decided to support as a kid
not looking good for celtic
milan goalie doesn't seem that confident on corners . so short ones possibly aren't the best idea .
could fans explain it to me please . i genuinely don't get it ? any brigadistas care to enlighten me ?
sad to see how far milan have fallen from the days of cafu , pirlo , maldini etc !
celtic fans going to start the usual pish that ' at least parkhead atmosphere was amazing '. üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥
* hoping celtic win to cheer dario up * 
celtic atmosphere is better than ever
dads trying to get home from the hospital fast to see the celtic game , r.i.p me x
c'mon to fuck celtic
oh , celtic found some fans tonight then ...
too many sick games on don't no wat to watch ! think it's gotta be out of chelsea or milan üòÅ
celtic and basel . come on lads !
cmon celtic ! there are more goals in this !!!!"
thought i'd watch celtic for once so could sample the amazing european night atmosphere .......
 ajax leading barca with a goal , ac milan also 1 goal lead against celtic
watching celtic vs milan . seems to be the most lively of all
really like the way milan play !
love watching celtic in cl .... 
is it 2-0 milan ?
milan ahead thanks to kaka , dortmund winning , barcelona losing .
sometimes supporting celtic is energy-sapping . life is hard enough . come on celtic , give us one of the good nights please !
moan the milan intae these dirty basturds !!! 
if things stay this way , celtic won't even get europa league lol
celtic xi vs ac milan : forster , lustig , ambrose , van dijk , izaguirre , forrest , kayal , mulgrew , boerrigter , commons , samaras . 
22 ' corner kick untuk celtic 
i really hope celtic qualify from their group

kaka is a cunt against celtic , strolls it every time
mair√©ad and julz must love it when celtic are playing in the champions league .... naaat 
come on celtic
wow milan and ajax battling for second place in group h
celtic players are the worst crossers ever .. nani would fit in there no bother
arsenal will win chelsea will lose and celtic draw !
kaka made the right choice to move to milan again ! he has more playing time 
worst milan team in history but they can still defend
could celtic please try and test this dodgy looking keeper ...
i think someone underestimated ac milan
celtic have recovered well here . milan so dangerous on the counter tho . 
celtic ! rel giving away balls hoss ..
good chance for milan , kaka should of passed it earlier .
dfiference between having strikers , were all over milan but everytime they get a break they are so much closer to scoring
celtic need to be awake on the counter attack , could have been 2-0
watching kaka play for milan like he's back in 2008
been such a good start from celtic as well . apart from the goal of course .
this ac milan/celtic game is mint . flying past people
hate watching celtic in europe , where's that atmosphere every week ?
imagine actually supporting celtic , can't think of anything worse . scum
champions league night : ajax vs barca , bvb vs napoli , basel vs chelsea , arsenal vs marseille , celtic vs milan ... 
worst milan team i've seen but shows you how bad gary glitters 11 are 
quiet spell ends with kayal getting booted .. free kick . forrest cross ... boerigter chance .... !! nope ... then milan break .. . shot .. .
just realised i've had a bet on for celtic to win against ac millan üòîüò∂
twenty odd minutes played and still hasn't got his boabie oot .... what's up wee man . c'mon milan hahahshahhaha
kaka does it again . just like i wanted . 
close ! milan break at speed , kaka slips balotelli in on the right who checks and fires a shot narrowly over . 25 ' 
form is temporary , class is permanent . good heading from kaka , forzaa milan
still backing celtic against milan
who decided to leave kaka all on his own tonight ? 
celtic have everything but that bit of quality
celtic need to get commons into this game
come on celtic !!!!!!
love watching celtic in the champions league
i would have alot more respect for celtic if they had this kind of support in league matches
c'mon celtic ....... got my eye on an away champ league match ... make it happen please
watching kaka for milan here . getting back to his best . nothing like at madrid
share link for ac milan vs celtic please , hmm for live streaming especially :(
forrest is fucking peach tonight ! 
celtic look like conceding every time milan go forward .
interesting milan & ajax winning
that fucking run from kaka looked just like the one when he scored against celtic years ago
sorry but if you support another scottish team and ' like ' celtic then you are a wallaper
celtic park truly is magical isn't it ? the green plastic seats from the weekend amazingly turn into humans on champions league nights ! 
ac milan freekick count : 300
hard to know which defence is worse here .. celtic and milan's centre halves are shocking .
no matter how this turns out for celtic they will be up for sunday . they win , they'll have momentum , they lose , they'll be out for a boost .
just think how much better kaka's career would be if he never left milan . he's a legend .
kaka should never of left ac milan in first place 
hold together milan !
kaka‚Äôs run there just gave me a flashback to his old milan time
celtic vs milan is interesting game so far ! some quality football !
have no idea what to watch . barca , celtic , arsenal , dortmund or chelsea ?!
cmon celtic
jack wilshere , reus , n kaka scored . and celtic leading against barcelona . wow . am hppy with this . still looking forward .
milan have played great tonight i never knew best we have played all season apart from the napoli game
 ac milan vs celtic 
all over milan as well
kaka just glided past about 4 celtic midfielders . is this 2005 ?
celtic game is very good . get it on if you are not watching it already .
good to see kaka playing again for milan
fancied orient , wolves and preston in the l1 games tonight , ac milan and dortmund good prices in the cl games . didn't back any though .
this honestly shocking chelsea , celtic come on i don't want to give rangers fans the satisfaction ..
kaka is what milan was missing .
ac milan 1-0 celtic
balotelli makes bad use of kaka's good play . but celtic have been pressing oh !
celtic are playing so well now
celtic are playing very well
deja vu this kaka ' counter attack vs celtic in 2007
ricky kaka goaaaaaal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! celtic 0-1 milan #22
how long will celtic and their support get away with supporting terrorists . absolute disgrace of a football club .
just seen kaka goal . awful defending by celtic from the corner
i have a test tomorrow .. but .. there's a match . milan is playing ! no way i could ever get on those books !
celtic have drove me to drinking on a tuesday .
can you imagine where milan would be without kaka'???!
come on celtic !!! 
get in there milan
im glad that kaka left real madrid ! he's already so much better at ac milan !
such a good counter attack by milan , kaka is still so good
one person letting celtic down here , in my opinion in most european games is commons . 
balotelli is no where near milan class
i wish i use to be still celtic daft üò´
come on celtic !
ac milan vs celtic .... u just need to watch this game right now
celtic and barca are already fuking my bet up .
 is playing very well .. 
dortmund winning 1-0 .. and ac milan is winning 1-0 ;)
celtic are doing well up until they give the ball to samaras 
sky italia not exactly sparing celtic's central defensive pairing : " they're big and strong but slow and tactically unaware ." ouch .
kaka in a milan top is what we like to see
the annoying thing is , the milan team are playing like they are 13th in serie a , this is diabolical .
ajax are beating barca and celtic beat ajax once therefore celtic are better than barca and are the best team in the world 
kaka what a spirit prince 
kak√† should've never left milan
celtic are a vile club .
22 ' offside , celtic . efe ambrose tries a through ball , but derk boerrigter is caught offside -az .
celtic don't have a good enough finisher to compete in europe
kaka is silky right about now 
gotta support celtic purely for the zante banter 
it is absolute bedlam out there . end to end to end to end ... still 1-0 milan tho ... 26mins
feel like its 2007 with kaka in this match , granted milan are playing a team at a similar level to vale !
game night 
tonight matthew , i'm a milan fan .
fuck off celtic , sort it out ya cunts
celtic are so bad
should have been 2-0 milan ! dammit
this mob are fucking rubbish celtic come on !
good cross from forrest but with a run like that from kaka celtic better be careful .
celtic are playing better football than milan üòÖ
celtic all over these just don't look like scoring
streeeming celtic vs milan
arsenal 1 up , whilst celtic are 1 down 
celtic are playing really well
come on celtic
need to start taking some of these chances celtic 
mon to fuck celtic
celtic fans are wank . only ever turn up for champions league games !! 
celtic v ac milan ... tasty match ! ... " bad boy " - balotelli playing ..... 
c'mon to fuck celtic 
kaka has recently been playing very well for milan
come on celtic
davie goes " this milan mob are playing shite " minute later they score . typical
celtic need to make something with this pressure
kris commons is awful . overrated by celtic fans and pundits alike .
go celtic !
ha there's someone that plays for ac milan called bonera . imagine if he didn't have an a on the end . he'd be called boner üòÇüòÇ x 
actually genuinely hope celtic win 
celtic * 
as a punter who's laid milan , you can stick " zonal marking " up your arse ! 
briliant play by d ex-madrid playmaker kaka vs celtic
this young guy forrest from celtic looks like he has good potential
ac milan's team is sheeet
forster at fault for goal ? if hart was in that position the press would be slating him tomorrow morning !
if only kak√° didn't feel at home in milan , he wouldn't be scoring . 0-1
nice to see that celtic are losing ! 
come on celtic !!
the celtic x ac milan game is heated
watching a soccer game , after more than a year , lol ... milan kaka and baloteli
c'mon celtic ffs
wits the celtic score ???
 ‚Äì goal alert : celtic 0-1 * ac milan *( kaka 13 ‚Äô) 
ac milan really aren't anything special now . shame to see them sitting 13th in serie a .
i'd love to have an away day at celtic park
maybe that's why they don't take shots from outside the box ... or maybe commons is just awful . 
celtic are seriously missing scott brown mainly because beram kayal is absolutely shite now !
watching arsenal against marseille since it's the only game i can watch other than the milan game .
celtic is kk nep
nothing to do with supernatural but anyone watching the celtic game ? ohh , i love supernatural :) -the true god
kaka rolling back the years but celtic defence not performing well 
chelsea been dire , barca down not good and celtic losing . fuck off
celtic fans going mad on saturday saying aberdeen fans are a disgrace ..? ohh the irony 
kaka created by ac milan destroyed by real madrid . revived by ac milan
cmon celtic !
ajax are winning 1-0 , just to make things even worse ... 
celtic and marseille should better know what they are doing ... equalize a$ap
have ty say celtic are playing good football
celtic have been so much better than milan both legs
come on celtic , get back in it
wouldn't begrudge forde a move to celtic at all !
spettacolari i tifosi del celtic ! 
nice to see milan playing with some intensity 
comparing william wallace to an irish terrorist that's a new low from the celtic fans tonight ! do these people have no shame ?
listening to the milan match commentary it seems those who hated kaka's return are becoming converts fast !
kaka is back to his best , running the show against celtic
milan to win easy
kaka back to haunt celtic 
it looked like the was a slight touch on the ball by the goalkeeper after balotelli shot , no corner . 
celtic must be the only fans in the world allowed to openly support terrorists
i love seeing celtic losing but watching it does make me miss those amazing champions league nights at ibrox
just seen kaka burst through the middle ! 
with ajax and ac milan up , things are good atm , plus the glorious are winning the u20 game at firhill 'tdotuesdays 
celtic are scum 
accumulator is fairly all owa at the minute . 
nearly all good news wolves winning celtic losing but orient spoiling it !!
je mate milan celtic >>>>>
celtic sort it out you cunts
in all fairness it's a minority of celtic fans that actually support the ira
kaka ... wow . with the ball at his feet , he is tearing celtic apart . magnificent thus far .
celtic losing and ajax winning . 
watching arsenal v marseille on tv , and streaming celtic v milan on skygo .
few things get the heart going as a milan fan lately ... thank god for kaka w/ the ball at his foot and space .
proper impressed with celtic even though they're 1-0 down . playing some great stuff , just need a predator up top to put them away .
barca and celtic losing .... its such a wonderful life :)
last time ac milan kept an away clean sheet in the ucl was at white hart lane . hardly surprising .
kaka pissing all over celtic tbh
4-4-2 /4-4-1-1 just won't do against an acm team with that midfield . celtic getting killed by better passing and better shape of ac
riccardo kaka ! 
kak√† should've never left milan
playing not too badly but delivery is poor 
just chilling wathing celtic vs milan not bad
celticüíöüíö
id watch the arsenal game but ac milan are playing and kakas playing
alitalia rebuffs ryanair collaboration offer : milan ( reuters ) - cash-strapped alitalia rebuffed on tuesday an offer from ... 
neil lennon putting in a dip ... i might have to do the same soon if celtic don't score before ht
celtic shouldn't be behind .. their spirit is quite awesome !
celtic must thinks it's 1981 all over again holding a picture of bobby samds lol .
gooooool goool gooool kaaakaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
this milan side are poor . 
ac milan buttt !!!! 92izerrr
chances coming thick and fast at both ends . boerrigter threatens for celtic , before balotelli fires over for milan . 26 mins gone .
studying abroad spring break 2014 !! italy milan here i come üíÉ
why couldnt we buy one of these milan midfeilders instead of fellaini
 down by one . ajax scum leading barca . ffs thats not how the script is suppose to go !
celtic in spl = shit . celtic in europe = decent
used to always want celtic to win on european nights , simply for scottish football ... but nowadays i hope they get destroyed . horrible club
celtic milan game is going offffff
still fancy celtic to take this keep the faith come on celtic
kaka's a different player in that ac milan shirt
celtic have been brilliant since conceding the goal .
kaka has been so good for milan these last 2 games
celtic are turning the screw against milan now .
celtic need to be wary pushing that midfield up . kaka just took full advantage of space & set up balotelli for what should've been 2-0 .
i really hate celtic
match choice , iove it . watching celtic mainly
the stress levels in this house when a celtic game is on is unreal .
come on celtic please keep me informed as i am just off work üò¢üçÄ
wish celtic had a fucking striker .
kaka ' shining all the way at milan .... 
25¬¥ 1-0 1-0 0-1 1-0 
again n again bonera save milan
can i ask where this milan was when we played chievo ... and genoa ? our ucl performance does not reflect our domestic struggle 
come on celtic !!!!
celtic aw er these cunts
davie provan is the commentary equivalent of the film speed . saying anything negative or that celtic get a wrong decision and he'll explode .
i like celtic sorry to say they not good enough .
i've just rewatched some videos from the concert in milan
can't stand celtic
this celtic vs milan game is liveeee !
best izaguirre has played for a long long time . 
" worse milan team ever " they said , " cant wait to get them at parkhead " they said , " we'll do them and get to the last 16 " they said ...

celtic park on champions league nights are amazing .
when did chris sutton become the milan centre half
celtic scumbags

ref is utter shite . celtic players getting kicked off the pitch .

celtic have the most disgusting fans in the world .
hahahaha it's not looking good for celtic
if milan win a will punch my maw square in the back
the mu3ale2 said l celtic fee 7alat hayajen . such a badass .
put the tv on to watch dortmund v napoli . completely sucked in by celtic v milan . kaka ' rolling back the years .
weird how people from this area get slated for liking celtic yet you's pipe up week in week out about chelsea arsenal man utd etcüòÇüòÇüòÇ
champions league ... celtic üíöüçÄ
before tonight ... kaka's last champions league goal for ac milan came against celtic in 2007 .... and who won that night ?

celtic are playing so much better after the goal
hey celtic , stop being so useless ..
i will never understand why everyone loves celtic
some good football being played in this celtic v milan match
fine effort from celtic .... break ... boerrigter down the left . crosses .... headed clear .... 0-1 still .. cfc are going to get caught here .
i hope celtic get fucking pumped , fed up with their shite they bring in that's got nothing to do with the football !

milan are quality on the break

love watching celtic have a go in europe
cmon celtic üëå
milan keeper is vulnerable on high baez . c'mon . kaka running the show .
 showing a positive response to going a goal down have controlled play since 
come on to fuck celtic !!
ac milan is playing good rn
milan look dangerous on the break
milan gagne >>>>>>>>
bad news , bhoys : not only are celtic trailing at home to milan , but ajax now lead against barcelona !
celtic - acm watchen
ajax leading barca and celtic loosing to milan , if it finishes like that then the group will be wide open 
do quite like milan me
everytime milan go on the attack they look like scoring , defence all over the place .
ac milan have so much more pace than we do !
milan looking dangerous on the counter 
i'm not an expert when it comes to tactics , but is there anyone who thinks zonal marking is good ? all i see is criticism of it . 
come on celtic & ajax !
love football hate celtic
celtic are so overrated they're shite
i rel vex dan ! onlii celtic n ac milan game goin on ! flow cannt b on that chupz !
milan look like a slick wee team on the counter
milan are trying to walk it in here .
tweet more about celtic than ye do rangers üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
only inzaghi and shev are missing from this milan team ! to many wasted chances !
i hate it cuz milan was such a stupid silly goal
bonera having a good match so far 
if you've got sky check the atmosphere at celtic park compare to the emirates . the emirates is always quiet 
arsenal chelsea & celtic bore me to death !!! 
fucks sake celtic .
surely celtic have got to try and exploit that abbiati . he's playing like a real chump .
davie provan after commons shot high and wide : " he never got his body shape right , did he ?" i could have told you that years ago . 
cant believe ac got kaka for free , celtic should have tried to sign him
celtic really miss petrov and lambert
kaka is so much better off at acm as much as i hate to admit it
why have milan not got pirlo on ?
speaking of peado so hear celtic are losing
only a matter of time before ac score a 2nd ... celtic wide open here
could have been 2 for ac milan !!!
scary how fast ac milan are at counter attacks
reminds me a bit of the celtic juve game last season
this is milan nights
come on celtic sort it outt
actually embarrassed for the majority of celtic fans they have to be represented by that shower of plastic paddies
milan with a good chance there , well done ambrose clearing it .. kaka with ¬†very close shot .. no closing down
milan looking like they could kill us on the break
and they pkay fooball the glasgow celtic way . 
two super eagle players in action tonite john o mikel for chelsea and ambrose efe for celtic
the fact celtic and barca are losing 1-0 makes me want to cry
celtic milan how quick . have a go
 vulnerable to a doing now . got to go for it though
milan keeper looking suspect . celtic strikers need to start testing barthez !
big night for celtic ! 
abbiati is fair dodge can't believe milan never bought any1 to replace him
that cross had to go to commons ' feet instead of over the defender üò° 
come on milan , don't let me down like city already are doing .
 grande conclusione di ricky
kaka to milan again had been the best transfer i can think of ever . 
dortmund v napoli is not livin up to me expectations . going to have to go flicking through games and dodge the celtic game 2bedifferent
why is kaka getting so much room and time on the ball ? c'mon celtic
big bo selecta having a cracker on the left for celtic .
kaka is nice when he's playing for milan üëå
quite like milan because off kaka and balotelli
kaka tearing celtic a new one
kaka is on form tonight , running the show for milan .
celtic can't handle kaka too good
decent this celtic milan game
celtic are a bunch o diving cheating minky bastards 
milan are absolutely battering them here .
celtic you wankstains score 2 !!!
this milan game is quality
just think only one celtic player has scored in the group stages this year .... and that was forrest from a penalty
actually embarrassing being behind to ross county would beat them 
so glad kaka is at ac milan again
commentators and the media always arse sook celtic , will never understand why though , they're scum man !
wake the fuck up celtic
milan making celtic look exactly what they are , completely and utterly average !
celtic milan is a decent game end to end kaka playing some nice stuff
milan would be shit without kaka .
kaka is ripping celtic apart here ! what a player
the kaka ' at milan is massively better than the kaka ' we saw at real . he is unplayable when he's in full flow , phenomenal .
kaka looks back to his best at milan again
milan is playing gud tho
celtic with the worst marking since scott brown sat his standard grade english exam
can see milan getting a second on the break here ...
can't decide which game to watch . settled on celtic for now .
milan are shit but could easily score a couple on the break
all the rangers fans supporting milan for the night i'm so proud
i can see us getting a goal , but sadly milan look more than capable of getting another one themselves :-/
acutly want celtic to win
celtic terror banners - utterly pathetic
ive yet to see a united fan say anything bad towards celtic tonight ... just me eh ?
now this is the kaka that first came to milan
slipped on my milan jersey üò∑
sitting in work getting stressed out the fuck with all of tweets !!!! mon the fuck celtic !!!!
kaka is beastin ' celtic here . great to see
kaka alone has the power to silence celtic park . what a performance !
we're bein penetrated like fuck & it's the first am uncomfortable wi bein fucked by italians . come on celtic
right , who said ac milan were pish ? beautiful counter-attack football . :(
ac milan have a solid team
celtic vs kak√† 0-1 
celtic park always knows how to hold a competitive football match , no matter the opponent 
we're in trouble here . milan have us exactly where they want us .
celtic abeg score na !
has there ever been a player for celtic with less bottle or heart then james forrest ? wee fucking shitebag
let's go ac milan !
celtic-milan is actually a decent game ! is class !
common celtic !
its so nice to see kaka back in that milan shirt .
celtic taking the game to milan , but the italians look very dangerous on the counter . kaka has been class .
mulgrew is over committing far too much . if kayal is that far forward he has to drop back a bit . got taken right out the game there 
ffs c'mon celtic üò¨
milan are terrible aren't they ? no wonder their fans are up in arms . i mean , this fast pace and quick passing tempo is shocking :-)
kayal and mulgrew far too committed going forward . milan getting far too much space to break into . only a matter of time before it's punished
kaka is on fiyaaaa . just missed the far post . celtic is pushing milan tho ' great game .
kaka back to his world class best for ac milan tonight 
fuckjng schoolboy defending for that goal celtic
kaka is onit . 2 nite hhaa fuck you celtic
celtic defence looks abit dodgy
this game has been kaka vs celtic so far .
that kaka run brought back memories why did madrid try and ruin him still world class
kaka easy destroying celtic like
kaka is playing unbelievable ! best i've seen him play since his last season at milan
need to score 4 or 5 to win this .. milan deffo score again . defence no where to be seen . to much space for milan
milan killing celtic on the counter attack !
i'm so behind , didn't realise that ballotelli played for ac milan ! #3monthstoolater
all about celtic v milan tonight
kaka seeing far too much of the ball cmon celtic
celtic playing ac milan off the park but ac look like they will score next . that's football for ya
kaka and balotelli making bits of the celtic defense
we're playing decent against celtic , why the hell don't we play like this in serie a ?
celtic seeing a lot of the ball going forward , but milan look so dangerous on the counter attack , with kaka coming close to a second
cannot wait until celtic start defending . that'll be great ! 
woooww :o former star player real madrid score goal laa . 
kaka is the heart and soul of this milan side
kaka looks like the old kaka which is bad for celtic üò≥ looks fitter and faster !
ehm i wonder what galloway has to say about the last two celtic displays since he had alot to say about the troops singing apparently ....
no kaka no ac milan and then we kiss champions league goodbye
celtic fans have been fucking shite tonight . barely even supporting their team
all about celtic vs ac milan ! kakas balling
kaka scores all of milan's goals , what did they ever do without him .
it kinda touches my heart when those celtic fans sing " you'll never walk alone ".
coming back to milan was such a great thing for kaka .. he wasn't playing to his full potential at madrid
celtic are actually playing very well
kaka just looks a different player at milan !
celtic still have a good chance in beating milan today . 
kayal could play for milan the amount of time he spends on the floor
90 % of dundonian celtic will use this excuse for supporting celtic " i support celtic cos my grandads glasweigain and he supports celtic "
come on celtic , into them , stop making pish teams look good 
celtic have been terrible this season üò©üíî
celtic all over the place at the back here
arsenal and milan my niggars ...
milan's keeper looks dodgy
celtic can't handle kaka
why are celtic constantly letting themselves get out numbered at the back
che ricardo !!! 
even a get embarrassed when a chick uploads a pic in a 5 year old celtic top captioned " come on you boys in green " 
kaka should never have left milan !
does the whole celtic rangers thing bore anyone else ?? jesus fucking christ it's dull as fuck .
currently watching the young kaka who started at milan . he is unreal , never lost his touch 
kaka deffo looks like a the player of old back in the milan shirt ! he's so silky !
all i've heard is ' now kaka ' celtic forget he won the ballon d'or? he's still got it , fs lads
unreal how quick ac milan counter on us
4 screens showing the arsenal game , really ? there is dortmund , milan and atletico madrid !
now playing chant masters - celtic chant on ocean waves ambient
supporting celtic isn't good for your health at all .... going to burst a blood vessel here
kaka is running the show against celtic , it may appear the lad has still got it .
the standard of that ac milan team is so low compared to 5 years ago
watching my pal giorgios just cheers up my day !! 
only watching celtic vs milan to watch kaka what a player he is
kaka is really trying to make sure that scolari comes back to bring him to next summer's world cup finals . only positive in awful milan yr .
* live * celtic glasgow - milan " segna gol 2 celtic " -----> 2 , 18
samaras drifting out wide too often , celtic effectively playing with no one up front !
celtic giving too much space for kaka to run in to . 
went tits when milan scored 
are we watching from 2007 ??? 
tmosphere at celtic park amazing as always 
seriously kaka ' is playing like the kaka ' of old tonight . it is celtic but still . its a joy . marvelous talent 
kaka the milan man for the break ! celtic on top but milan doing a juve from last season ! intelligent from ac !
milan providing a big threat on the break already
kaka is making shit out celtic
kaka has still got it 
kaka showing his class tonight celtic need to get all over him 
kaka -destroyed by real madrid now reacued by milan
celtic started forrest tonight as they were looking for a flashüòâ
anybody who thought kak√° was a bad signing for milan .... i hope you're watching this game . √°
anyone still not liking the kaka signing ? he's been milan's best player since he came back from injury .
result from arsenal and celtic tonight and i'm a happy man
i have this game .... even though i want celtic to win 
 v in my mind i'm watching v 
would love too see milan win but i have celtic to win so cmon celtic
sembra che il milan in non faccia √† come in campionato 
25 ' attempt missed . kris commons ( celtic ) right footed shot from outside the box is high and wide to the right . -az .
just saw a photo of that celtic green brigade banner . what an embarrassment .
would not be a shock if milan scored a second . they look very dangerous on the break .
celtic offer absolutely nothing going forward . no invention or movement at all . frustrating to watch 
celtic always good value in the champs league 
milan and leyton orient are up üëä
i know kaka isn't as good as he once was . giving him the freedom of celtic park isn't wise .
i hate milan but kaka should have never ever left
tonight's the night celtic got raped of kaka
why would celtic wanna qualify for the round of 16 ? is killing them 
i think that if we play our cards shrewdly , we might be able to flog anderson to ac milan
good game this ! both going for it ! 
kaka should of never gone to real madrid he seems so much better at milan
never saw celtic play but they're running hardd
kaka don catch water ! not fire he's killing celtic alone .
celtic don't deserve to be in the champions league . idiotic fans , obsessed with a club two divisions below them and play in a shit league .
celtic r giving me heart attacks here !!!
should be at least 3-0 to ac milan by now , missing siters ! 
ref in the celtic game has it spot on i reckon . lettin the game flow ! more refs should be like this
why does irish tv show so many glasgow celtic matches , but so few from hamilton academicals and inverness caledonian thistle ?
love seeing kaka play this well in a milan shirt again .
big loss kayal going off for he started very well
milan can get so far to fuck .
it's nights like this that it sucks to be a celtic and chelsea fan .
sub celtic : kayal has to leave the pitch due to injury and is replaced by joe ledley . 30 ' 
ooo all the celtic fans on my feed tweeting about kaka to hide their shameüòâüòè
love st mirren fans commenting on celtic . come back once youve heard champions league music blasted at your home ground midweek
kayal off , now we have celtic
30 celtic forced into an early switch as an injured kayal is replaced by joe ledley .
kaka is flying tonight unfortunately for celtic
only players i rate from celtic is kayal commons mulgrew and forster
kaka tearing celtic a new one
come on celtic !!!! üçÄ
moan the ledley , should have been on from the start ! most underrated celtic player !
celtic always play well in the cl . i'm very impressed with james forrest ! 
gr8 2 c kaka in form an enjoying is football this season back at ac milan gr8 player
baba god that did it for celtic last season will def see ajax through
kaka has still got it tearing celtic apart
lots of celtic players are incredibly underrated not sure how a " bigger " club hasn't picked up players like forster , forrest even mulgrew
kayal off ... best news for celtic all night : l
which game is better chelsea vs basil or milan vs celtic ?
kaka is singlehandedly tearing celtic apart 
ledley will equalise 
how good was that marking from celtic
watching celtic milan in cl . cant help but think premier league would be even better if glasgow clubs included . amazing atmosphere !
celtic have the chance to be utter cunts tonight ... a rare accolade .
its funny how kaka goes bak 2 milan nd he starts play'n gd again
so good to see kaka playing well . 
oh well that's celtic fucked 1 nil down and they bring on joe ledley
come on to fuck celtic get the finger out imagine thinking we were better than milan kayal off deadly ledley on game on 
kak√° has been milan's best player since he arrived . instant impact .
kaka's playing brilliantly against celtic
beram kayal coming off with injury . joe ledley on . 
was los 
amusing banners at celtic park . great to see in front of the world . not a recent picture of bob was it ?
fsss celtic
 very menacing on the break . being given too much space when they regain possession . 
it's a pleasure to see football talent such as kaka and balotlelli while drunk celtic supporters argue amount at themselves üòÑ‚öΩÔ∏èüëç
team low in confidence ? not won for while ? fans on your back ? never mind play celtic and all will be better .
this is vintage kaka '. balotelli looks determined . 
ian watkins is a celtic fan
because their continued pandering towards ira terrorist group has nothing to do with celtic fc . it has nothing to do with scottish football .
the defending by celtic there was the worst thing i've seen since man of steel .
kaka is everywhere ! everywhere ! such an absolute world-class player that needs , especially these days . 
kaka and montolivo is the ac milan midfield . üëå 
cmon celtic !!! <3 
this has to be the worst ac milan team in years .
kaka is just toying with celtic
milan vince per noi 
why do some of the celtic players not have sponsors logos on their shirts ?
milan goal ! nice . great !
only a matter if time before milan do us on the break
milan >>>>
that's it , i'm streaming milan and chelsea during second half !
kayal injury . physical or mental ? i wonder . lesley a supreme operator anyway 
oh look . celtic are bringing on their best midfielder .
celtic's attacking movement and width outside of box has been working . final ball and runs in the area lacking .
glad kaka is doing better at milan :')
sick note is the only one who looks like he could score so far . 
c'mon celtic üò© 
kaka is feeling it , he has put milan on his shoulders . big phil are you watching ?
after watching 30 mins of this pish ,,, im off ,,, celtic are just not interested in this game ,,, weak plays and no commitment
still believe ......... c'mon celtic !!!!
what celtic were doing for kakas goal i do not know
celtic can't match us tonight
this celtic match is upsetting !
i actually wouldn't mind if ajax win this match ... barcelona has nothing to lose .. but if they lose ac milan also have to lose ...
so celtic are comparing sir william wallace who is a scottish hero to bobby sands a member of the ira ?
milan , where stuttgart left backs are made .
kaka , milan real captain without armband
just seen kaka's goal against celtic . did they not think he was on the pitch ? where was the marking ? 
champions league where everyone is a celtic fan for a night
i'm just saying , we should have atleast 2 goals in this game by now . milan keep making mistakes and were just not capitalising on them .
milan's keeper is as dodgy as del boy
why is kayal wearing a celtic shirt without the sponsor when everyone else is wearing one with the sponsor ?
not so great for celtic fans but love seeing kaka scoring again at the highest level . probably my favourite footballer .
ledley should of been on before him anyway . 
ajax beating barca . hopefully they send milan to europa league .
champions league action right now !!! arsenal and celtic live right now
kaka rolling back the years . although he is only playing against celtic .
watching celtic in the champions league from a glasgow pub certainly adds to the enjoyment .... celtic playing well too . 
i'm not obsessed with celtic . but we need some consistency with uefa . teams constantly fined . including us , for stuff they seem to get ...
kaka's having a stormer up to now for milan . involved in everything .
celtic park a wee bit quiet tonight
" support your local " however i want celtic to do well in europe only because they are scottish
settle for celtic/milan game
why is milan and dortmund winning
milan please stop wasting all these chances to extend the lead
first time a put my money with celtic and the last
watching the celtic game ... provan is an awful commentator ! saying the wrong players names every two minutes ! not sure he is even watching !
that might do celtic a favour . that kayal is absolutely dug shite .
well that's celtic out
celtic's marking at the corner for the goal was terrible ..
celtic is playing with high pressure , milan need to take over the midfield , draw defenders in and then attack in the gaps made
kayal limping ... tightest hamstrings in europe , that lad . 0-1 milan ... celtic on the charge , milan lounging back , waiting for the break .
kaka is running riot here . celtic are so open having to go for it - could well get tanked here !
i'm actually so happy kaka is with milan
ajax 1 - 0 up against barca and kaka scores for milan .. imagine saying that a few years back ...
watching barca v ajax in the dining room while napoli v dortmund is on in the living room and celtic v milan going on in the kitchen .. 
sale kayal entra : ledly cambio celtic al 30 ' ( por lesion )
3 times now players have passed up the opportunity to exploit space in front of them in favour of a speculative shot . so unnecessary .
the most shameful the player real madrid have ruined his career is sahin and kaka . look how wunderbar they now at dortmund and milan .
such a goal to concede , against milan too . mountain to climb 
come on celtic xx
is it 2-0 milan ?! everyone is going feel about kaka again .
come on celtic .
not looking good for celtic 
half-time giveaway : rt and follow for a chance to win a copy of ' sean fallon : celtic's iron man '. winner announced shortly .
16 year old aberdeen fans on twitter complaining that celtic fans know nothing about sands . what do you know about him ? 
if celtic just get the final ball right there in every time
kaka's curling effort almost increases milan's lead . still 1-0 milan after 30 mins .
i think milan will be back only if allegri sacked , he is really nothing after those years with milan 
haha . that's some marking from celtic . mugs . 
6 celtic players and forster in the 6 yard box . only one kaka !
looks kaka and ac milan are destined together .
celtic vs milan üëå‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è 
see to be honest ac milan's shit üí©
dortmund , ajax , arsenal , and milan all leading their respective matches

what the fuck man , last time i checked you were a rangers fan , now you support celticüòÇüòÇ ?
some people seem more obsessed with celtic/rangers than their own team , and are just constantly on a smear campaign against eachother . zzzzz
the milan keeper is all over the place
wonder if ill spot eoin on tv at the celtic match .....
kaka is a revelation for milan .. leading where balotelli fails .

 se balade contre le 
is it me or is the milan fans quiet üò≥
milan lead 0-1 at celtic arsenal 1-0 up against marseille courtesy of a fine strike in the first minute from jack wilshere ajax 1-0 barca
celtic to win 1-0 was a brilliant bet so proud of maself :)))
when did kaka move back to milan ??? 
damn you , stream ! i want milan , not love buddies !
celtic taking it to ac . balo or kaka would bag one on a counter tho
madrid bought him for 50m , didn't play much because injury when he played he did unreal and now back being unreal at milan for free ..
kaka runs the show at ac milan
i know it's only celtic , but kaka is back
why is birsa on milan ? he's not even serie b quality .

kaka should never of left milan
* adds celtic park to stadiums that have to be visited before i die *
 vs 1-0 
cannot wait for milan to woooop celtic
pat bonner is the most biased ' reporter ' i have ever seen . can we not have a neutral covering the celtic games like we do the others ?
was watching arsenal vs marseille but just to have a look at one of my most fav players , turned to celtic v milan . 1-0 milan
cannot believe the room that celtic are affording ac milan
celtic back to 11 men as kayal goes off
i've been wanting to buy a milan jersey with a name on it , i think i know who's i'll buy ... #22
 0-1 cambio out in 
celtic down already
celtic playing well need just a goal to spur them on to win this
if you need any proof of how far milan have fallen , valter birsa is starting for them in a crucial champions league away game ....
celtic needy sort it out here and give me some beauts to look at
cambio : ledley por kayal 32 '
c'mon celtic

ajax up 1-0 and ac milan up as well üëç
celtic showing everyone how not to defend a corner !
arsenal's match is dead , i'm switching to milan vs celtic
ac milan vs celtic also dont have sial in mio tv .
kaka surely had his weetabix this morning he's running the show at celtic tonight ! üëå 
aww damn missed keano on thought he'd packed in the punditry so watched the celtic game instead .. still time to turn over for half time
celtic is a little part of ireland to me
celtic's crossing is absolutely disgraceful !
im really engaged in this celtic - milan game
come on celtic . love watching them on champs league nights .
so , my father bought me an arsenal jersey that time . i love arsenal & then inter milan , so i love inter milan ....
boerrigter works a good shot , deflected for a corner , come on celtic !
looks like a pretty shoddy effort by whoever put the magners logo's on the celtic shirts tonight . peeling off something chronic .
celtic play like barcelona up until they are in the final 3rd of the pitch , than they play like young fifers
watching milan
come on celtic please
other than that celtic are dominating
hoping celtic win just for the fact jordan wont come back in a bad mood
kak√° has looked so good this year . looks like his early ac milan days . world cup call up for sure 
c'mon celtic do it for scotland ! üíöüíô
watchin ac milan v celtic
kaka went back to milan and acted like he ain't ever left huh ?
in other news from the constant hate among football fans on a night involving a celtic game , i'm away to tuck into a curry 
 corner celtic
my dad doesn't give a fuck about anything apart from celtic
okay i'm now watching the milan match just to watch the veteran ricardo kaka
our game seems to rely on getting it wide & getting it in . which is fine . as long as the crossing is good . hasn't always been 
ac milan are cheats ! üòí
so much celtic chat !
c'mon celtic we need this win tonight !!! üôèüçÄ
 is dominating this game . 
couldn't resist a treble on barca , celtic and porto to win now they are losing ! 50/1 now 
celtic fans proving once again they are the best fans in the world ; half an hour gone and they haven't assaulted the milan goalkeeper .
i was wondering why on earth they'd be showing celtic-milan and not napoli-bvb but not anymore . great game . kaka !!!
dear celtic . yous are terrible at crossing the ball in !! stop it please
why do some celtic players ' strips have the sponsor's logo on and others don't?
celtic vs milan is the game you should be watching
ajax beating barca ac beating celtic i like the sound of this so far
shift should have ended already , i hate celtic !
32 another celtic corner as boerrigter's shot is deflected wide . mulgrew takes it and this time abbiati makes the catch .

cmon celtic you can do better than this
' cause milan , milan is our name ! 2/2
is there an anti-celtic conspiracy taking place ? ( i.e. ajax-bar√ßa ? ) 
time for james forrest to break out his secret weapon 
 playing some magic tricks in ! he makes everyone else-and that includes look bad !! 
milan is a big baby
the milan keeper catches one ! forrest slips and gets a foul against him , total accident
 , : al 30 ' cambio , per .
dont get how rangers fans can rip celtic fans in any way at all
i knew kaka would score !! 
the young fella forrest looks way too good to be at a team like celtic .
after 30 minutes , both milan and ajax hold onto 1-0 leads , will either of these teams keep the lead ?
boerrigter cuts in from the left and fires one from distance that's deflected and out for a corner . signs of celtic coming to life . 
modareb celtic mota7ames awy !!
celtic home champions league games are the one's to watch üëå
will celtic's crossing still be as shite in an independent scotland ? probably , aye . 
mind when dida got slapped at celtic park haha !
kaka has been amazing for milan
not a bad game this celtic v milan .
well look like ac milan a go kill celtic today finally winning state 
30 celtic forced into an early switch as an injured kayal is replaced by joe ledley
kaka absolutely lording it here against celtic . reminds me of d days wen he was young and unstoppable 
big fan of poli for milan ..
charlie mulgrew probably the biggest celtic player and hes not in the box for corners ....
nothing wrong with that challenge by forrest 
boerrigter shot .. deflected . corner .... mulgrew passes it into the keeper's hands . 0-1 milan . 33 mins gone ... we need a goal before h/t
shit # barcelona , celtic and porto all behind ! real shit#
 playing some magic tricks in ! he makes everyone else-and that includes -look bad !! 
shades of the old kaka tonight . worrying signs . 
wasn't expecting milan to score
ac milan keeper looks dodgey just keep testing him , glad to see ledley on aswell
milan game for sure
supporting celtic cause there scottish
kaka looks like the player of old playing again for milan .
the ac vrs celtic game dey happen bad
c'mon celtic
it's a pleasure to see football talent such as kaka and balotlelli , while some drunk celtic supporters argue amongst themselves üòÑ‚öΩÔ∏èüëç
i made my james forrest tackle related pun too early . he was lucky the milan player didn't make more of that one .
the douche that sent off nani is officiating celtic v milan . still gutted
by the way , that has to be the worst milan side i've ever saw . and i'm almost 22 ...
milan is bigggg
celtic - milan ( diretta ) via 
anyone else notice that only some of the celtic players have magners badges on their tops ?
on the other hand , ajax scores against barcelona though , but we should want barca's win . coz ajax's point might cause problem for milan .
milan is playing like crap ! my lord !
i just saw a tackle that was perfectly fine in the celtic ac milan game and the ref gives a free kick
kaka is still one of the tidiest footballs in the game !! ball control is unreal 
don't know why i get my hopes up that the next game is going to be the one that celtic remember how to find the back of the net . nae chance .
our passing has been smooth as fuck 
what a freebie that goal was for kaka . milan looking dangerous on the counter 
none of ac milan's starting 11 are numbers 1 - 11 üòú .
milan is actually playing well ...
seriously , the man has everything . picks a pass , mega at set pieces , great leader aswell . too good for celtic tbh
watching the celtic vs milan game . just realised its that stupid cunt from turkey redding the game
can't watch the celtic game cos i'm at squash 
celtic haven't had a good player since henri camara lol
nidge is n goals 4 milan üòÑ
just know celtic will fuck my accumulator up tonight
celtic are like a naughty child you can't take anywhere without being embarrassed .
celtic !
when you play with love you play better , ricardo kaka milan is your home .
kaka with milan is 20 times better than he ever was with madrid
subliminal advertising at celtic park , sponsored by the scottish chippies assoc , is working , i could really go a chicken supper now .
why is gary hooper not playing for celtic ? is he injured
crispy passing there for milan ;)
that's the old kaka , good for him he went back to milan .
hate when scottish fans don't see the benefit of celtic doing well in europe , support their opposition and then complain about the state ...
kaka is really finding back his form in ac milan ...
why did kaka ever leave milan ?
robinho for birsa please 
the cunt birsa is rotten for milan 
a celtic win will see more money into the economy and thus more taxes to the queen . and u rangers fans say u love her . 
celtic need to put a decent ball in the box ffs
milan can fuck right off
pish corners so far from celtic not that we have been that great from them this season . but at least hit a celtic player with them
ac milan are going to win the champions league ... you heard it here first
so glad kaka is back at milan nearly the end of an era
come on ol ' bwoys ! 
kaka show al celtic park
wee forrest showing his tackle skills again 
milan just too skilful in midfield .
think neil lennon's got celtic/celtic , his head has gone
just watched milan‚Äôs goal again , with the theme tune to some mothers do ave ‚Äò em dubbed over . fits like a glove .
celtic have no game changing players like a a larsson or petrov !
celtic and barca to win : 3
link for celtic game ?
i think this referee is a milan fan
need pal in to guitar-back my concertina playing - lively celtic tunes , fr singing , folksongs wed nights . gd fun 357 7773
the atmosphere at celtic when champions league is around is so good , they all love football so much
milan look a better side in this game than they did in the one at the san siro
hope that ref doesnt fuck celtic around like he did to us in the last 16 vs madrid last year 
arsenal play the best football by far ! easy win ! also , got to feel for celtic . they always get a tough group ! can't see them making it .
watching the and and also the game has well 
watching kaka at milan makes me wanna cry lol
can't do that ... 
milan 0-1 voor , ajax 1-0 voor , today is a good day if u would ask me !
milan need just 10 more players like kaka to win the title .
celtic game tonight ... if they dont win ... kev wont be a happy bunny :o 
in games likes this it really does highlight the quality we lost on the summer which we haven't replaced , esp wanyama 
common celtic ...
keep calm cules we only need 1 point in 2 games to be on top of the table ! unless milan loses some points then we'll need 0 points
why do some of the celtic players not have the magners sign ??
celtic ac is a wide open game entertaining stuff 
it's mad how shit ac milan are now ...... in all fairness most of italian team are rubbish nowadays !
if i was a betting man i'd bet on celtic .
robinho should replace birsa , he is bad today .. 
come on celtic
it's that wanker that sent nani off at old trafford , hope he sends some celtic player off for doing the same thing
if i'm the coach , i'm thinking this game is winnable on the counter-attack . if i'm coach , i go for it anyway
celtic's heads are gone , plot lost .
32 another celtic corner as boerrigter's shot is deflected wide . mulgrew takes it and this time abbiati makes the catch .
why does all my hero's score against celtic ? 
cuneyt cakir is the ref for celtic's game the old turkish cunt
celtic are like a completely different team in europe
why why why am i at the celtic game
ma coupon widda been dortmund n ac milan , 15 pound double the nyt , obv av no got it on tha , hope dortmund draw n ballotelli scores 6 :)
let's go get this champs league w today .
think this is the worst milan team in my short time on this earth 
magners wort be happy tonight , logos all fell off .... 
celtic , barca and porto would need to wise the fuck up
anybody know what barbara put in those milk and cookies she served this milan team last night ?
yaaaaaaaaaas get home to see it's 1-0 to ac milan ! get in .
would love to go to celtic park during on a champions league night the atmosphere is always electric 
nice to see milan in the lead .
unlucky celtic .... that fucking wank of a ref is in charge tonight
just need that celtic goal . this is not the right time to regain memories kaka . you're a legend way , proceed please ...
flamini showing what he learned in ac milan .. the italian goon
how can celtic not cop on and put a player in front of ac keeper on corners like . basic stuff really
kudos to celtic fc and their fans , the pics of their display tonight is the first time i've ever seen them display a saltire ever . 
 = kaka has scored for milan at celtic
am i the only person who'd like to set celtic supporters alight ?
are they watching in madrid ? kaka + 10 for milan and callej√≥n almost equalizing for napoli
celtic are too flat and predictable . mullgrew is sickening my pish at the min !
... of scottish football . if celtic were to do better , scottish football would eventually be better and maybe one day we could compete again
just seen the milan goal . embarrassing or what 
why have some celtic players no got a sponsor on their top ? ?
is there a reason why the commentators get as excited for attacks as the celtic fans ?
whys half the celtic team got magners on there strips & half of them dont lol ?
celtic just look like what they are . a distinctly average team ( when compared to teams out with scotland . ) .
celtic chasing a game against the italians !! 
while celtic needs a comeback , ajax is winning 1-0 against barcelona after a serero goal
folk getting upset about a banner at celtic park ! :-) job well done to the green brigade !
celtic are nowhere near the team they were last year , losing wanyama and hooper really put them in the shitter
love watching celtic in europe ! the stadium is always electric .. come on you bhoys in green ! ‚öΩÔ∏è
just need that celtic goal . this is not the right time to regain memories kaka . you're a legend anyway , proceed please ...
 √° getting the goal for milan today ! second goal since his return back home
celtic players getting frustrated , i guess until the referee starts pulling the yellow card out .
the best thing about watching celtic get beat is seeing that ugly ginger bastard on the sidelines squirm !
can see why celtic fans hate this ref , he is an absolute dick sent nani of against real madrid last season 
watching the celtic vs milan game . just realised its that stupid cunt from turkey reffing the game .
ajax are beating barcelona , doesn't help celtic
ac milan must be in bop city
looking like celtic are fucked .. what a shame .
kaka was bought for ¬£56million . he was shit . milan have made a brilliant profit with a world class player . 
ya rab milan yfoz 2day .. bgd el wa7ed msh 3ayez ytnaked :))))
celtic down to 10 men mulgrew's just come on
come on celtic !
ac milan not won away so far all season ... although i suspect they have not been playing non league caliber sides that often 
in the car , on ma break listening to the game .. fucking mon celtic
uefa cl is milan's home . milan is your home , richy !! grande ricky , thank you for your return . 
arsenal ahead . celtic behind . and chelsea where they started . that's the report one-third way through tonight's champions league fixtures .
100% our fault at goal but seriously how much have milan payed this ref ??
go ac milan #22 
could do with barca pulling this back . arsenal , milan dortmund to keep a clean sheet now .
my bets for tonight . 4 home wins in arsenal , brentford , bradford & chesterfield . arsenal to win 3-0 & celtic 1-1 . 
celtic match referee is the tosspot who sent off nani against real madrid - he's like the european version of kevin friend 
watching the celtic v ac milan game for one reason and one reason only : kaka 
basil all over chelsea first 30mins . need both basil and celtic to pull something out of the bag tonight .
35 ' celtic 0 vs 1 milan 
when i get out of class and see that milan is winning and barcelona is losing üòÅ
kak√† looking like his old dynamic self so far against celtic . great to see .
we‚Äôre dropping like flies here 
who would you support in this case of say in 10 years time liverpool , bvb , athletic bilbao and celtic were all drawn in the same ucl group ?
i really hate when montolivo just wastes possession like that ! can't find a pass that kid same goes with our whole milan squad
you can never come between a milan fan and kaka . or any other player from the 06/07 season . you'll be asking for a fight .
celtic vs milan ! pick of the bunch ... this game is on fire !
who was the brazilian goalkeeper who played for ac milan in 2005 ?? can picture him now ... head's gone !
seeing kaka back in a ac milan shirt .. one word : legend .
celtic on the rampage absolutely dominating this game against ac milan getting pumped 0-1 forza milan
celtic are all over a.c. should be winning . 
ac milan - ajax afc 
blah - can't find my celtic sword letter opener . :(
kaka been playing good since moving to milan
that cunt of a referee who sent nani off against madrid is reffing this celtic game 
milan are 1-0 up if anyone is interested , mwwwwwwah ... kaz
what's the celtic score ?
to pay tribute to bobby sands , celtic fans have his picture on a banner at parkhead tonight . me ? chicken supper and a can of coke obviously .
milan 1-0 up and still look like losing this game barca 1-0 down to ajax as well !! 
" celtic aren't a disrespectful , disgusting club " james forrest's dick says otherwise
the ref in charge of the celtic match is the same fuckn prick that sent of nani against madrid last season !! stupid prick he is !!
kaka is definitely milan's best player
this game really needs a celtic goal or something before this puts me to sleep , so boring ......
never understand the logic when it comes to celtic being scottish irish palestinian or whatever they fuckin are ..
1*t 32m celtic 0 - milan 1 cambio celtic sale kayal entra ledley
im watching arsenal meanwhile everyone else is watching milan üòÇ 
can't even listen to the celtic game because radio 5 is covering arsenal , as are council telly . tell me the point , some please . fuck sake
charlie mulgrew is too good for celtic
if kaka retire for years gawlen and wait til he is 97 and put on a milan shirt , he gine still play hard af .
amazing . milan player has his foot kicked completely off . writhes in agony . trainer sprays a little spray , he's back in the match . 
celtic are playing quality football it's just that one team has kaka & balotelli and the other has commons & kayal 
go celtic
if kaka stayed at ac milan he would probably be best player in the world ..
come on celtic !!!
watching milan and celticüëå
come on milan come on napoli come on italy <3
celtic - milan ( diretta ) via 
guted for kayal , chased everything when he was on , lets kick on now celtic !!!
champions league arsenal v marseille our celtic v ac milan ... nah watching 10 pin bowling on skysports 3 !
always liked kaka , so pleased he is back at ac milan
love when celtic are getting best because the mood in my house just gets amazing hahah sandy cutting about buzzing hahahah
it's games likes this it really does highlight the quality we lost in the summer which we haven't replaced , esp wanyama 
celtic giving it there all i must say !!!
milan's ~
why is every other celtic player's ( kayal , ambrose , izaguirre , samaras ) shirt sponsor falling off ?
a hate celtic
what celtic need is john sutton !
love it when celtic fans bite . 
celtic need to turn this around .. cba with moody boys üëä‚úã
celtic sucks
is celtic the worst team in the cl
afca &nd acm voor 
actually don't want celtic to go through , don't deserve it at all . just passionate that's it
ac milan are balls manüòÇüòÇ , good thing they've not got much competition !
if celtic could finish they'd be alri
i hate celtic with a passion
with or without tje armband , kaka is leading milan , montolivo hasn't just been anonymous tonight , he's had a quiet season to say the least
ac milan are shite
celtic have been so close , just can't score a goal
pukki would be perfect for how celtic are playing now
celtic need a bit more from samaras commons ... neither has been involved very much .... chance for mulgrew ..... left foot .. poor shot . 0-1
c'mon celtic
that milan defence is utter shite .
that milan defence ..... such a worry
montolivo has beeb the worst milan player so far . he is the captain fyi
celtic need to put chances away !
wounder why some of the celtic player dont have magners on their jersey
should have burst the net !! 
is celtic the worst team in the cl ?
celtic are too nice a team man no ruthless enough
that fabian barthez in the milan goal ? haha
's key task is to teach this midfield how to pass the ball . can't keep conceding possession . 
mon dha celtic keepdhafaith !
go go forza milan
mums two brothers came over to watch the celtic game üòÇ non stop shoutin n swearin üòÇ
oh come on ! ffs celtic ! 
kaka u are the only one playing in milan u are beast
watching the celtic game with my dadüçÄ
celtic vs ac milan
come on milan ... get into that useless garbage !!
this milan team is desperate ! how we're losing 1-0 is just beyond me ! 
grupo h - no momento : barcelona 10 pts milan 8 pts ajax 7 pts celtic 3 pts
montolivo hasn't found a milan player all night . milan very average .
serero makes it celtic 1-0 barcelona . it's south africa 1-0 spain again .
it's gonna come - 
montolivo has been the worst milan player so far . he is the captain fyi
celtic should have the ball in the net 3 times . 
that vile banner is a poor comparison .. 1 died a hero trying to free a nation , the other died in jail in a bed covered in shite .
milan vs celtic crazy game right now 
is it just me or is chris commons bigger than every other celtic player ?
nerves are wrecked here c'mon 
so pissed i can't watch the match . have to rely on tweets !
mulgrew with a fantastic chance for celtic , but it's easily gathered by abbiati 
ac milan is not the team they used to be
it's just not the same without messi tbh . i think i'll stick to this milan game . efe ambrose is almost like balotelli's strike partner here
yet another game in which so far i feel last season's first eleven would be winning . 
just checked the scores , gutted atleti only drew but still a point ! kaka's scored for milan and griffiths has scored for wolves , decent !
mulgrew gets the best chance yet for celtic to pull one back but cant get the ball out his feet
celtic have the best fans in britain . 4lyf
time to head towards school but celtic-ac milan has me glued to the couch/tv 
milan is here üéÄüòç
haaa .. the celtic game is on tv and i didn't even realise ... .. lol ..
want celtic to win to take it to the last game then get beat by barca
provan is s fuckwit . any tackle by milan , it's nasty . celtic ! he didny mean it . cunt
thank fuck " brave celtic " are about to be knocked out ... don't know why they give scottish teams routes in to the champions league ...
not lennons biggest fan , but celtic can get something tonight , playing some good stuff going forward
have a feeling it's gonna be another magical night celtic park and they gonna come back at win ... 
watching the celtic game and glanced over and saw it haha
issue i've got with celtic is the ira pish , cause i'm sorry but united were an irish club too and we quote gaelic as if we speak it
if celtic win but get knocked out because beat ... well , fair play to 
about 95% of united fans tweeting about celtic right now are tweeting it because they are jealous of celtics success and that's a fact .
was enjoying the celtic - milan game until i realised who is refereeing ... how did he get another cl game ?! 
celtic fans have probably just convinced the swinging voters to vote no to independence , what with wallace bein a terrorist and all .
the ref in the celtic game is crap !
how did wanting to spend one week in milan turn into a month long trip around italy ? 
celtic have wasted some good chances tonight .
my fucking god celtic need a decent striker
milan leading , goooood
hurts in my mouth ! come on celtic !!!
ac milan , what a team ! kaka u keep scoring . 
celtic are an embarrassment
come on ac milan * be passion * 
celtic obvo havnt learned from aberdeen on saturday .........
decent celtic fans must be mortified by the behaviour and banners from the green brigade .
do the green brigade even support celtic ? looks like they use cp the same way sf use black mountain , for propaganda and publicity stunts
8 minutes until half-time . can't really complain abt the performance , apart from the goal ... very committed , occasional quality . 0-1 acm
milan will be milan .
celtic get a terrible name for a minority . although it is pathetic that people still argue over religion in football in the 21st century .
i will say celtic has its way against barcelona
montolivo-worst milan captain ever 
this game is so open , we need to start making our chances count ! could score a couple against this milan team
i hope james forrest has a better defence than celtic from that corner
missing chance after chance , unacceptable 
so happy kaka went back to milan üôå
celtic are on tv in the champions league and meanwhile i am on a kingsferry coach going round every backstreet in the medway towns 
the ref really doesn't like celtic does he haha
should james forrest even be playing tonight ? 
awh poor wee celtic üòÇ
milan are playing sick
is it just me that thinks the milan keeper looks like scott brown ? üòÇ
the celtic tifo is class though
celtic are missing to many chances , it's gonna cost them 
great to see celtic r showing the world how scummy and bigoted they really r ! as they say its lucky am a billy no a tim ! 
pericard was more useful then kris commons has been in the first half of the celtic game .
mon celtic goal before half time
the lack of attacking quality in this celtic team is fucking shocking !!
come on celtic .
if celtic lose a can see this being a very quiet house later and tomorrow and one crabbit bf üò¥
c'mon celtic pull it back to 1-1 
come on celtic what's going on
celtic vs milan ... what a game !
a slight touch up in defence and a quality midfielder , this milan team could be a good one
one off the best feelings after nipping out to pick my daughter up from brownies and coming through the door to see celtic are getting beat
celtic getting closer . that's brentford winning 1-0 up now . 
fair to say ac or celtic won't be going to far in champions league ???
horrible penalty from ozil he's no having a good game , neither are celtic
always fascinated by kit numbers . in their match against tonight , no player in the 1st 11 has number 1-11 
awesome crowd at celtic park gives you goosebumps
wish celtic would get the finger out !!
never seen ac milan pass the ball so poorly ! they've been awful so far but still beating septic
where's rod stewart tonight ? 
kaka at milan is how it's meant to be
celtic are playing shite fs
mulgrew breaks free in the box but can't get enough power or direction on his shot . celtic pushing for an equaliser but milan lead 1-0 .
celtic do well well oooo
arsenal and milan to win please
the pets really don't like it when i watch celtic on account of all the screeching and swearing .
celtic are shitüòÇ
milan are poor all over the park passing has been awful
where's ur famous atmosphere celtic ? only when ur playing barca
love mine and my dad's wee nights in molly malone's , enjoying a drink and the celtic games üçÄüíö
celtic v milan not a bad game
some these milan players wouldn't get a game with a single team in the prem 
sitting down watching soccer . cmon celtic
celtic three chances , plenty of ball , but no goal . usual celtic cl story .
celtic trying to walk it in ffs , that keepers bobo . shoot from distance
celtic are the flukiest side i have ever seen , every single ricochet is falling to a hoop . shame they are awful and can't do a thing with it
actually terrified sitting next to my dad watching this game , he's going mental 
celtic getting in and around the milan box but not penetrating them with a clear chance , ref stops play again !
celtic fans once again proving that they have less intelligence than a bag of tatties .... absolute morons .
gooalllll letss goo ac milan !
this milan team are worst milan team i ever seen
milan need a second
kaka just gave the celtic player a ronaldinho smile ! 
your boy with the long hair in celtic is one absolute beaut of a man , just needy get scissors to that mop of his
have celtic‚Äôs witty terrace wags sung any topical scottish independence ditties yet ?
sitting in the tv lounge wi some very excitable celtic fans . funny as fuck . forza milan . 
funny how a lot of celtic fans are as scottish as the rest of the country but jizz over ireland .
referee is a cunt giving milan everything
another barca booking . fabregas to miss the match against celtic .
ac milan are a team of neymars diving cunts
i see the ref who sent nani off last season against madrid is ref for the celtic milan game . still can't do his job
yellow ! cesc fabregas will miss barcelona's next match against celtic .
there isnt one celtic player that would get in the top 8 teams of the epl and they play in the champions league every season
guarantee celtic will still win this game 
barca losing aswell as celtic 
yellow for cesc .. why i am not surprised ???? he will miss barca-celtic
this ref wants to ride kaka !! 
hope celtic get twatted ... used to like them many moons ago but fuck um
this referee's giving milan everything .
this is awful celtic !! just awful ...
kills me to say it but celtic are crying out for scott brown to just take some bodies .
cesc misses the game against celtic ..
now if milan can jus keep this lead
c'mon celtic u can get back
every time a celtic man makes a tackle , this cunt calls foul
i need something tah do ... my niggahs gotta game in milan n shxt
always had a soft spot for ac milan , but this current team are pretty bobbins . can see celtic getting something from this . 
worst thing kaka did in his career : moved to madrid best thing kaka did in his career : went back to milan .
and cesc gets a yellow . which means he'll miss the celtic match .
ac milan look fairly average , still confident
celtic 0-2 milan 
watch celtic play is so frustrating at times
celtic game on one telly and arsenal on the other üò≠üò≠ someone save me i'm outnumbered by men and i don't like it
whats happened to ac milan ? this is like watching an spl game . standard is shocking from both teams !
celtic were lucky there
c'mon to fuck celtic !
fabregas is booked , he will miss the celtic game
no fabregas next match vs celtic . great . 
hate celtic and lennon , wee scrote
aw come on celtic üçÄ
 successfully taking the heat out of this . discipline & patience required for to get back into it .
if only celtic had some quality in the final third , they could easily beat this poor milan side .
vamoos milan 
these italians must do gymnastic as a pass time ! c'mon ref ! 
something much more loveable about kaka in a milan shirt 
 is doing what they should be doing long back ; cohesive in the middle & playing the counter to hurt their opponents .
i bet they're atmosphere's buzzing when they play the against the dog and duck on a saturday ... 
got lucky there ! 
some let off . come on 
mario has the ball the in the net ... offside ... even tho it wasn't .... 0-1 milan ...

watching celtic play is so frustrating at times
official : cesc will miss the next champions league match at home vs celtic 
kaka is running this game for milan
celtic's defending tonight is absolutely shocking 
kaka looks a different player in a milan shirt .. from the timid one that turned out at madrid
cesc to miss next game against celtic
no goal ! balotelli runs through and dinks it over forster but the offside flag goes up and celtic escape . 39 ' 
fuck 
fuck off that wasnt offside milan should be up bu 2
celtic give away the stupidest freekicks possible . aye , a am looking at you chaz .
surely celtic can get a better defender than efe fucking ambrose ?
cesc is booked and will miss celtic game . :(
√∂zil's penalty-taking and diving lessons must be at the same school as celtic's defending set-piece drills . 
poor so far from celtic
lift it celtic !
celtic ... if you don't stop playing so shite soon you're gonna owe me a new tv üì∫üëäüí•
i‚Äôm gonnae say it . i think this celtic team is the most boring and devoid of flare i have ever watched . 
this is one of the worst milan teams in years
arsenal ... winning ac milan ... winning barca ... losing 
coming in from a 12hr shift to listen to your dad shout & ball at the tele because if the celtic game just isn't ideal üòêüî´

i love balotlelli ‚öΩÔ∏èclass act and the reason football is such a big sport , need a goal by celtic now though üëç
i hope fabregas won't get a longer ban for that . he will miss the last group game against celtic now .
it's probably more embarrassing that most celtic fans will love that display , but they won't have a clue what its about

balotelli has ball in celtic net but is flagged offside .
celtic should be winning , missing good chances 
i feel sorry for the decent celtic fans , yet another embaressing display from the green brigade that has hee haw to do with football

celtic fans booing kaka ?! well fuck you too ! 
celtic looking good ! just can't score
cesc gets his 3rd yellow card in the champions league this season and is suspended for the last group game , against celtic .

40 " celtic 0-1 milan "
on the other hand , kaka is doing everything for milan , world class ! but my stream is so behind i can't keep up

celtic are just playing hopeful passes here , nae creativity , nae urgency
oh what a surprise all the celtic fans have turned up ..... must be champions league night !
right , if celtic could please score and ajax could stick with this 1 nil lead that would be brill , cheers .
 : celtic u19s 1 ac milan u19s 1
milan may have ballotelli and kaka but they have some average enough players as well 
after 2 weeks of trains , planes & automobile journeys . it is time to relax with a cold beer in my hotel room near milan .
that was not offside ... ac milan should be two up ... damn that linesman !!!
cesc gets his 3rd yellow card in the champions league this season and is suspended for the last group game , against celtic .

celtic have been so one dimensional tonight , all they're trying to do in attack is cross
game celtic-milan power betul .

worst milan team i've ever seen .. if celtic players had any belief and played at 100% they are there for taken .

five mins to h/t .. we aren't making much headway here ... not quite gone quiet but it's gettung close .. 0-1 milan
why do united fans slag celtic and there fans every champions league night ?? i would rather watch ac milan at home than patrick thistle .
that's the prick of a ref at the celtic game that sent nani off last year against madrid ! hate that man !!
haha .. loving this !! celtic 2 - 0 barca
watching the milan game as i just love kaka
milan have become so shit that i feel relief that bonera is in defence . how sad is that

milan look a total different team with kaka in it pulling the strings
celtic are at best a mid table championship side 
celtic are surely out now
cheating diving milan bastards

celtic park is uncharacteristically quiet as well ...
milan has to win now
celtic 0-1 milan 
celtic canny get near them here
good job ajax , 2-0 barcelona , good job milan 1-0 celtic
wouldn't mind of being at celtic tonight to see kaka

the celtic fans whistling as the milan players move the ball around , frustrating them
ajax beating barca 2-0 ... if it stays like that celtic are out then .
very poor milan team too ...
ac milan dealing with celtic at the moment by being much smarter rather than much better ... 
goal alert !!! celtic 2-0 barca
glad ajax is winning so ac milan doesn't qualify . :-)
celtic yous have no fucking midfield
ajax are properly trolling celtic tonight .
i'm watching the celtic ac milan game so i can watch the main man !! 
samaras is so clumsy like wow .. celtic could do with another top class striker .. not the same since hooper left
celtic has it bad
celtic aren't playing to bad defense is a bit poor though
2-0 ajax ... come on milan finish the job and put them out !! 
celtic !
dear football : going through a rough patch where you can't win to save yourself ? consider playing in the 
asdfghjkl yellow card for cescy and it means he misses the next game against celtic .
i think champions league has made european football average , i mean although celtic losing they're on a par with european superpower ac milan
2-0 ajax , that's us fucked . 
very open game this , milan commiting plenty forward , not very italian at 1 up . if only kaka wasn't embarrassed in possession
if these two results hold up , are eliminated from europe tonight
shoulda stayed in glasgow extra night just to see ac milan .
this reminds me of the celtic game last season .
celtic are screwed , 2-0 ajax !!!
breaking : snipers at celtic park shooting milan players at will
i thought milan were the bet of the night tonight .
i think jamsie forrest has his boaby out again as he's missing in fukin action 
celtic fans loving the ajax score now
cesc suspended against celtic
all the milan players are in the wrong sport man , 9/10 for diving ya cunts
looks very much like celtic are going completely out of europe tonight !......... :d :d :d :d
" it was not by dialectic that it pleased god to save his people ." - st. ambrose of milan
looks like celtic won't even get the uefa cup spot .
last year's cl team would've been 3 up by now against this milan team
cesc gets his 3rd yellow card in the champions league this season and is suspended for the last group game , against celtic .
sameras from celtic has to be the luckiest football ever how is he playing in the champions league he would look average in the championship
barcelona are tryna let ajax win ! they don't want milan to qualify
can we all just stop for a brief moment and ask ourselves why is samaras captaining celtic tonightüò≥üôàüî´
celtic losing , ajax winning is pleasing .
celtic r shite , aye they r ! team a poofs , wheres the fight ?
ajax 2-0 !! barca are doing celtic no such favours !
suppose the champions league is good for a laugh . now they no what its like to be a diddy team 
football aside , ac milan are a disgrace in sportsmanship , common decency and fair play
wouldn't mind drawing ac milan in the knockout stages , they don't look too clever at the moment
come on celtic
 is also on score sheet for milan ....
yass ajax bye bye celtic
fuckin hell ajax haha , i've got them in a treble with milan and leverkusen come onnn

2-0 ajax , night couldn't get worse for celtic so far
ajax 2 barca 0 what is happening ?? milan can't go through this way !
love ya ajax . keep it up and hope celtic beats milan .
i freaking love celtic europe nights : 3 only proper atmosphere since rangers dropped ! 
celtic frustrate me
a tip for the milan team , you have feet stay on them , diving cheating bastards
celtic are out
come on milan ..
celtic are out
ajax go 2-0 up vs barcelona . bad news for celtic - unless the scottish champs can come back against milan they'll finish bottom of group .
hope somebody at the celtic game hurts the referee . turkish twat
watching milan purely for balotelli
looks like celtic are going completely out of europe tonight !!
celtic are poison
milan must win now , ajax are leading against barcelona by 2-0 !
watching a bit of the celtic game , haven't seen the xmas tree set out for so long 
 play almost nothing directly through middle of midfield . why is that ?
bar√ßa needs to comeback though , so milan automatically advances with a win today .
ajax beating barca 2-0 and celtic getting beat 1-0 . hehehe üòè
this celtic match is depressing me
as it stands celtic are out of europe
yesss ajax , celtic are going out üòÉ

bad news for milan , barcelona destroyed by mighty ajax
celtic fans showing their the best fans ever as usual with that banner 
ucl half time update ajax 2-0 barca dortmund 1-0 napoli arsenal 1-0 marseille milan 1-0 celtic
yessssss c'mon ajaxxx , celtic out before christmas !!!!
not heard of birsa but he's been abysmal for milan .
celtic and barca are shit
switching from the chelsea or celtic game over to the arsenal is embarrassing 
‚Äú a man is responsible for his ignorance . ‚Äù¬† ‚Äï milan kundera , ¬†laughable loves
can't say i'm impressed by this current celtic team , severely lacking a match-winning player
need another striker for the 2nd half 
and kaka scores for ac milan . always nice to see him score . and barca is losing .. happi feeling everywhere :-)
get beat off celtic , beating barca 2-0 .
what the hell is scott brown doing playing as ac milan's goalkeeper ?? 
good play¬†boerrigter , throw in at the milan corner flag , poor cross , milan come forward
kaka again for milan ! best player at milan currently
that will be celtic out then ajax 2 up
let's go , ..!
if the results stay like this celtic won't even make the europa league lol
do celtic practice crossing ??
of course why would the milan game be on tv üò°üò≠ 
celtic fans laughing at barcelona losing yeah makes complete sense
put ¬£20 on milan to win :)) !
celtic games shite
night night celtic
even when they win they're unlucky 
- seems like am the only one watching the ac milan game
ajax do the glasgow celtic .
that ajax-barca score affects milan and celtic more than it affects barca .
good play but no final product from celtic .
don't no who's worse celtic or milan 
barca are doing this shit on purpose or what ? 
all celtic have to do to win is go in at half time and sign a world class striker that's eligible for the 2nd half .
c'mon tae fuck celtic
forest who plays for celtic is beautiful ! üò±
brilliant atmosphere at celtic park . its that good a heard the guy in the big jock knew stand fartin .
common celtic ! prove me wrong !
come on celtic/ajax !!
worst performance yet so far . a real chance against an ordinary milan team . giving them way too much time on ball . not up for it really üòü
let's all laugh at celtic !!! instead of laughing at me for putting barcelona in my coupon !
kaka got splinters at madrid and now he's back to his old form at milan . fair play
soooo , the kids are watching bob the builder on the big tv ..... and scott and i have ended up watching the celtic game on ipad mini !
folks chill out and have faith . 
oh , wait . they sold j-p papin to milan before they won the cl . still , that reinforces my point . they've always been a selling club .
celtic could be doing with someone like kenny miller right now
barcelona 2-0 down at ajax . really , really bad night for celtic .
celtic giving milan a real game here . just need a little rub of the green .
the crosses celtic are putting in are treadful
ajax 2-0 up , celtic 0-1 down at home . not a good night !
fucking hell fair to say we're fucked 
barca is losing 2-0 against celtic ;) 
ajax 2-0 v barcelona . not good news for celtic ...
james forrest is actually so fuckin shit , don't know what any celtic fan ( as retarded as they are ) see in him .
celtic fc = most frustrating team on the planet
yh mate celtic and barca are letting me down bet you've got a to win
celtic 1-0 down and ajax 2-0 up holy shit haha
' where are celtic fans at the spl games ?' - you fuckin high . no wonder they stay in their bed who gets a semi watchin st mirren etc at home ?
ajax winning and celtic losing 
feels for celtic fans :p
we really need the new bhoy !! 
get it up ye celtic 
come on celtic and ajax ! want to see a cracker of a last day in group h .
celtic just don't have that wee bit of quality you need at this level
this is the worst ac milan side i've ever seen ?! and they're still beating the time at home ...
mon da hoops !!! 
celtic looking for inspiration from the green brigade's " come on celtic we love the bhoys in green " banner .
milan keeper has a touch of the barthez about him 
celtic canny cross a ball for shit , fucking joke . for a team that rely on wing play so heavily aswell , nae excuse for fuck sake
izaguirre offers celtic absolutely useless width when going forward . his crossing is so poor and he gets caught out at the back too often .
i love celtic üíö so much better now that wank hooper has left ‚úäüí¶
shocking half from barca and celtic , wake up to fuck
celtic canny cross the road tonight . not once has the ball beaten the first man . 
ajax scores .. i bet barca are losing on purpose just so milan wont qualify .
is it bad to think that aberdeen and inverness if they played this milan team would keep it at 0-0 going into half-time
celtic going out of europe completely at the moment
if celtic could put a decent ball into the box they would have a half decent chance here
celtic to win 10.00
hate celtic
ajax butchering barcelona haha ... this is celtic's opportunity !
celtic are proper shit . ac should be 5 up .
looks like it won't matter what do here . ajax 2-0 v barca .
2-1 celticüëè
how did wanting to spend one week in milan turn into a month long trip around italy ? 
celtic lead 2-0 against barcelona ! massive
wins for ajax , dortmund and celtic please !
c'mon celtic !!!!!!
easy game for milan goalie so far .
be fierce handy having that winger for milan in your gaf ... 
kaka ' is tearing celtic apart ! 
2-0 ajax ! come on milan
milan should be 2 up hate to say it
kaka rolling back the years here . celtic aren't making it difficult mind - inviting milan to counter-attack .
ine if the big reasons of this bad acmilan is montolivo and his bad form , i trust him to back in form again soon milan
birsa is fucking shite . not his fault milan signed him but so out of his depth .
barcelona down 2-0 just when milan would need their victory ...
my 4 fold of milan brentford wolves and orient is looking decent atm !
kaka is milan right now .
this celtic team is totally deprived of attacking ability that's anywhere near the adequate standard . sad really .
it's nearly half time and i've just noticed that milan haven't started pirlo ! why ?! he is a midfield maestro !!
milan need more quality
milan kit looks so good with black shorts .
it's not looking good lads ... 
plenty of decent build up but the crossing is shite 
celtic might not even be in the europa as ajax are winning 2-0 vs barca hahaha amazing !
ac milan are absolutely shocking , and celtic are worse !
getting worse for celtic cos ajax is leading against barca in amsterdam
barca 2 down . come on celtic . gunners should have this 
celtic player james forrest arrested over alleged sexual assault .
celtic severely lacking a cutting edge !
2 v 1 for milan and they fuck it up . better pass and it was most likely game over with balo at the back post .
honestly do not know why milan bought birsa . fucking piss poor player
birsa sucks man , allegri ruined milan lol
milan should have killed this off by half time , some of the chances they've wasted have been unreal
half of these milan players sound like either some kind of pasta , or some foreign kind of bread :p
2-0 ajax ! does that mean if celtic get beat off milan there out ?
i love watching celtic at home in the champions league .. so entertaining
birsa just isn't good enough to play at this level . wouldn't even be able to get job shoeshining for milan a decade ago .
bollocks its 2-0 ajax . awful for celtic and my acca . couldn't be worse for me right now .
mcdonald's , starbucks , and celtic on the t.v. ? sounds good to me
that celtic banner is disgraceful 
would love if ajax qualified from their group . winner takes all clash in milan as it stands .
in bursts milan have been very good tonight , but sometimes the final ball has been disgusting
the amount of attacking players on the pitch for celtic . why the fuck r they playing back to fucking much ........ come on bhoys .
say what you like about milan's goal but celtic inability to put a proper cross into the box is equally as bad .
ajax 2-0 up celtic getting beat from a poor milan side they thought they would roll over a smell a conspiracy rant coming on
come on barca ! celtic ! marseille ! porto ! basel ! & chelsea ! get some goals in ! 
wish i was at the celtic game right nowüòîüòî
why on earth did milan ever sign birsa ?
ajax 2-0 up . celtic in massive trouble here .
some celtic fans are truly horrible cunts
absolute disaster celtic
geez , is milan teething or something ? pique looking like he hasn't got the sense god gave canned peas !
it's like pure panic when any celtic player has the baw . just trying to get rid of it . team of shitebags . except virgil and lustig , <3
so , arsenal 1-0 , chelsea 0-0 , celtic loosing to milan . not entirely convincing ... can a british team win the this season ?
that right mid/winger guy from milan is shocking
milan's passing in the final third has been poor .
i can't wait for the milan game later üëå
celtic is actually good
anyone know the score of celtic vs ac milan ?
barca aren't helping celtic at all tonight . 2 slack mistakes giving away the goals
kaka and celtic . smh ....
this milan team are dreadful . i'm embarrassed we are losing - yet again to them
at this rate celtic may have to venture outside their penalty area at the nou camp
that prick birsa is a fukin imposter , hes no passed to a milan player aww nite 
i don't see how milan are struggling so bad this season . their squad looks better than it has done for a few years !
derk boerrigter is the dutch james forrest . tricksy and quicksy but crosses like didier agathe 
if we don't get something from this game i will be gutted .. below average milan team , bring on stokesy !!!
do celtic have any wingers or full backs who can cross a ball . all the cl campaign we have goten into good wide positions to no avail
frustrating stuff from celtic . poor in the final third , apart from a few flashes from james forrest ...
celtic v milan doom
pockets of inefficiency : montolivo and birsa notably . 
kaka has been merking since his move to ac milan
with up 2-nil at home to , absolutely need to score two against 
a bobby out at parkhead tonight . is it james forrest's again ? 
just explained in detail to my father how shite celtic are there actually shite widny go see ten if they school gave me tickets fs
keep it up milan !
come on to fuck barca that wasn't the plan haha you's were meant to pump ajax for being bastards , celtic beat ac and you's let us win for us
no messi , no barca .. i wonder why messi didn't have injury against milan hahaha
apparently , barcelona only know how to beat and humiliate milan . vaffanculo !
' mon the hoops 
very bad night for celtic so far , oh well :d
get the finger out celtic üôè
final ball just needs to b better .... 
ac milan are painfully bad now compared to what they were like in 2005 
cmon celtic pls 
2 added minutes at celtic park .
wish he would've exploded at madrid but i'm glad he's doing dope at milan . he's a legend
just finished explaining to my uncle that dutch celtic defender virgil van dijk is the grandson of dick van dike
things aren't looking good for celtic 1 - 0 down and ajax leading barcelona 2 - 0 
all the way from milan , italy . don't really need to say much more .
win for celtic and ajax would see : barca , 10 . ajax , 7 , celtic , 6 , milan , 5 . would be a nail-biter .
if celtic score twice . basel and bradford score . and then everything stays as it is , i've won 525 quid
celtic are shocking
think celtic have underestimated milan here a little
survey : how well have you played against celtic ? if samaras has looked like a footballer , then you have played terribly . 
life as a celtic fan can be very frustrating at times
last minute of 1st half .... and nothing is happening . i don't mean in a strcitly existential sense ... just . forget it . 2mins added 0-1 acm
ac milan your defense is falling apart ! wtf !
celtic are fuckups
i'm watching a celtic game in the champions league and we don't have a single striker on the pitch
if ajax beat barca and milan beat celtic is that them out of europe all together ?
every third tweet on my tl is celtic related !! what's the fascination ?
looks like celtic nil again . hope i'm wrong boeringer looks capable of making space just need someone in there . stokes 4 samaras for 30 mins
come on celtic
its a very quiet celtic park tonight . not good for the comeback .
allez celtic glasgow ! 
basketball training was great tonight !! now time for the celtic and milan game at the railway .... c'mon the hoops !!!!!
if it stays like this in the celtic match and ajax match then celtic go out of europe !?
celtic are awful
with ajax winning 2-0 against barca this puts milan in a must win situation .
even if celtic were to turn it round and win it would be pretty difficult to go through with ajax winning
ajax pumping barca aswell . milan and ajax are pish pity we don't have any quality in team . we would have been through by now
celtic doing a fine job of filling the void by being scotland's resident scummy cunts now that rangers are dead .
barcelona want milan out of the champions league clearly .
tonight proves that celtic football club have no control over the green brigade and are scared of dealing with them properly .
ajax 2 . :) milan can win this group .
i'm just happy that milan is winning and kaka scored the goal 
celtic's atmosphere and barcalona's score .
my hatred for celtic is unreal , scummy unwashed taig cunts .
dont see how like utd/dee fans support celtic in europe , cos its " good for scottish football " fuck thum there 100% scum , i see them as irish
celtic have been awful .
how long until we see celtic fans saying it's a conspiracy and barca are laying down to ajax just to knock celtic out .
are celtic losing ?
bar√ßa losing 2-0 ? celtic almost definitely are out
celtic should bring commons on .
currently watching milan and singing my heart out ! 
kaka is amazing for milan . 
ac milan are so shite
celtic pls take it eazy oo
we're making milan look like world beaters
why are these commentators freaking out when celtic get these chances that would never go in ?
love that celtic jersey 
the milan keeper is shook
celtic are out
kaka is bound 2 smile every time he no's is gettin a game against celtic 
sami header from 10 yards ... nothin doing .... 0-1 milan
just hope that milan will losses the match agains celtic so that ajax can go to knock out phase and no more milan
are these two the official celtic commentators . they do every celtic game . samaras !!!! loool
thats more like it 
my experiences of anti-celtic racism from english people don't qualify me to speak about other racisms : they are not the same .
uefa fined ajax ¬£21k for the display of a sectarian banner . what is celtic going to be fined for this hideous sectarian display ?
milan's attack is too much for celtic ! it's just le finale ball
old man on phone : we're in the minneapolis airport wife : no we aren't we're in moline man : oh sorry we're in the milan airport ty : facepalm
looks like the end for celtic 1-0 down and ajax 2-0 up
need to sort a celtic game soon
i would love to see ajax advance . milan aren't strong in my opinion .
i am struck with the same thought whenever i watch celtic ... does anyone understand how samaras manages to get paid to play football ?
celtic 0 - 1 milan 1st half 
fuck watching english teams . watching milan vs celtic . 
milan toying with the tic 
never mind ! i love ajax and want them to qualify anyway ! as long as we beat/draw with celtic and qualify top of the group i don't care !
awful news for celtic if ajax continue to blitz barca . will be out of europe tonight if results stay the same in group h .
it would seem that only celtic foul , ac , do what ever they want
celtic are out
ac milan are poor at the back this game is not over . one goal would defo change this game and they would panic .
barcelona's fabregas receives third yellow card of champions league this season against ajax and therefore misses celtic clash .
very close to winning this bet celtic better bang a goal in
ajax 2-0 up against barcelona . if the dutch had shown such fighting spirit in 1940 europe might have been a different place ...

ajax causing it , celtic pish as usual and arsenal bossing it , how good is flamini but ? 
don't care how many people have said this but i fucking hate all the glory hunters in dundee that support celtic and the fact it's never‚Ä¶
i'm fucking buzzing if this stays the same celtic are out of europe
 are beating on purpose . orange theory 
2-0 ajax and a pathetic display of football by celtic against an unbelievably poor milan . tonight is turning out exactly as i expected .
celtic huffing and puffing but not getting anywhere wouldn't be surprised if milan pick them off on the counter attack 
sad stowee : milan clubs
nice play from kaka . he makes different for milan .
been fairly meh in the arsenal match . wish itv would've shown the celtic or chelsea match instead .
celtic & bvb sing ynwa well but anfield will always be the place you'll hear it best .
only a matter of time before milan kill this game off 
unlucky celtic .. 
celtic fans are cunts
celtic game is a bit like ours against thistle , sit back soak up the pressure and hit them on the break

" chelsea > loosing < to milan " - just saw that on a recognized account 
arsenal up , ajax up , wolves up , milan up . it's a good day .
pure shite ... 
crucial that celtic get the next goal millan look as though they could score on the break at anytime , not enough quality crosses from celtic
the god of celtic just sitting on his throne smiling at ajax
very good half from milan . on this football fan's fantasy christmas wish list - an iso camera on kaka every week playing in the spl .

balo is gonna leave milan in the summer . the team is not good enough for him to stay
ht celtic 0-1 ac milan , a big 45 mins needed from celtic . stay tuned ! 
that has to be without doubt the worst celtic . central midfield partnership ever
watching samaras for celtic for 45 minutes has made me ill . he is dog shit

ht : celtic 0 - 1 milan . 
i know everyone watching the celtic milan game are thinking the same thing ..... kaka's still got it ‚öΩ
just when you need a decent ball in , chris commons goes and does that 
everyone's focused on celtic , but ajax is leading barcelona by two goals to nil hahahahahaha !

celtic played awful , hope for an improvement in the second half
how is ajax doing a better job than milan :/
what a damaging 1st half !! 
how much crosses to celtic fuck up . it not hard to either beat the first man or put it in the right area .
to say its only united fans slating celtic is just plain and simple shite and lehs .
kaka just looks so much better in a milan kit :-d
halftime vs , 0-1 . goal kaka . 
half time . celtic 0-1 milan . 
half time in all the games . arsenal 1 marseille 0 , basel 0 chelsea 0 , ac milan 1 celtic 0

halftime ; arsenal 1 0 marseille barcelona 0 2 ajax basel 0 0 chelsea napoli 0 1 borussia dortmund celtic 0 1 ac milan 
celtic fans are delusional
barcelona playing bad against ajax just so milan don't get to the round of 16 ..

milan are shit but celtic have been poor , samaras is dog shit as usual will never score with him up top
shocker of a half despite the better chances a real bhummer
ajax 2 / barca 0 & celtic 0 / milan 1 it all started well with st. johnston winning away to rosenberg too

looking like no europe after december unless celtic get clinical .
half time : celtic o - milan 1
celtic out the champions league nowüòÅ
ht : 0-1 ac milan celtic 1-0 down to kaka-inspired ac with the brazilian putting on a bit of a show at parkhead .
come on ajax ! celtic , do something !
" trust kaka to get them out of the recent mess they've got themselves in ." 
wonder how good kaka would have been if he stayed at milan injury free
this milan team is awful , the scoreline is embarrassing .
kris commons is really really overrated , watched him for about 6 years at derby and celtic and he's so so frustrating ...
 come on 
45 mins for celtic to stay in europe 
baffling how defending can be that bad at this level . 
barca losing .. celtic losing .. chelsea not losing . perfect üëå
halftime : g . celtic vs ac milan : 0 - 1
samras = godawfulplayer , would hate to pay to watch him . 
celtic are famous for come backs , we need one tonight badly , we need to change tactics also
half time : celtic vs milan 0-1 ... 
1sthalf scores updates : basel 0-0 chelsea , arsenal 1-0 marseille , dortmond 1-0 napoli , ajax 2-0 barcelona , celtic 0-1 acmillan
celtic atmosphere meh , kaka shouldn't be scoring header plus celtic need a goal or they are out .
that was such a nothing goal to lose that if milan were any kind of good-sports they'd put one in for us at their end .
bad goal that celtic handed them . we can do this .
been a good performance so far apart fi 6 of them standin in the 6 yard box watchin kaka ' 
howling goal for celtic to give away , at any level , never mind . not been too bad otherwise . spewing at ajax score as well .
kaka scored the only as ac milan leading celtic 1-nil at halftime 
c'mon to heck celtic
ht . celtic 0-1 milan 
hope celtic get humped
would just love a bet up !! celtic and barca may get going if ive any hope !
piss off celtic
hahaa ! barcelona isn't so good todayüòÇ well done ajax .. c'mon celticüôè
come on celtic
celtic are almost out of the . barca looks so vulnerable without messi .
the only team to play barca bravely and not park the bus has been the " kids " of ajax ! learn , rm , chelsea , inter , milan , everyone basically !!
half time : celtic 0-1 milan : kaka 13 '. 
not a lot of goalmouth action , but were largely in control and deserved their lead even if the defending was poor . 
if we stop the sloppy play and get in about milan this is still possible
this celtic game has been soooo boring .
james forrest is now a sex offender both off and on the pitch after a decent performance like that 1-0 milan
come on to fuck celtic
il meriatava di pi√π , bene il that the world will know your skill
nicee 1st half ‚ô•
results couldn't be any worse as it stands 
1-0 milan at half time . kaka the standout . celtic much better after conceding through sloppy marking 
ht : celtic 0 - 1 ac milan ( kaka ' 12 ' ) 
well i for one don't think we deserve to be a goal down after the first half 
celtic getting beat is the only thing cheering me up tonight
celtic playing well unfortunate to be 1 down . we've had a few chances we need to do better in front of goal
as things stand , celtic are out of europe completely . something i didn't even consider happening tonight .
ajax should better score 4 ... ac milan must qualify !!!
rubbish defence celtic please be better in 2nd half lennon kick there backside man
can't see celtic pulling this one off
cmon the hoops gunna show them in the second half hh 
half time , celtic 0 - 1 milan . . 
maybe if celtic had signed a striker to replace the striker we sold we might be doing a little better . wild idea , i know .
" scott who " asks one celtic fan . " brown , the guy whose petulant kick has left us without a sense of leadership " replies another .
milan defense has been excellent tonight
got so many fucking huns on my bbm slagging off celtic , just gonnae no
if kaka doesn't get called up to brazil , scolari is out of his mind . 
celtic need a big center forward who knows where the onion bag is
to say this games frustrating is an understatement , we still have a chance though 
fraser forster emulating joe hart gives milan the lead at half time . we might need a mars bar style steward to come on and rescue this gme !
half time ! celtic 0-1 milan
kaka just doesn't fail to disappoint in milan colours . not then , not now .
i'm watching the dortmund and napoli game so i don't know how barcelona are losing nor how milan are playing . congrats for the goal kaka !
what a bloody aweful referee ! 
ht celtic 0 - 1 milansilly free header has cost us the goal , but we have been fantastic !! 
2 poor teams out there tonight . i can see how milan are 13th in there league . were no better .
if celtic weren't so useless and scored twice i could actually win money
nice to see kaka back to himself at milan , completed 3/3 take-ons so far this game .
ht : celtic 0-1 ac milan √† 
celtic drive me mental sometimes
if that young celtic lad forrest keeps practicing he might become nearly as good as peter pawlett .
half time : celtic vs milan 0-1 your comments ?
utter tripe celtic fucking jokers !!
woeful from celtic ! can't even deliver set piece , never mind defend one !
poor from celtic .
bleurgh . we can definitely come back to win this ... if uefa grants us special dispensation to loan gary hooper for 45 minutes 
uninspiring stuff from in the first half , but they won't give a toss right now .
fuck sake celtic
i don't know how celtic do it in europe . the reality is they would be lucky to finish mid table in the championship .
2-0 ajax . need a massive 45 now celtic
0-1 ht . huge ask for celtic who need to score twice to stay alive , milan look more than capable of punishing on the break
c'mon celtic üçÄüçÄ intae them
lucas doesnt even know what eam he likes . nigga goes from mdrid to man u to ac milan
am at the celtic game wae about 12479086 layers a clothes on n a can still feel the coldness üíÄ
halftime : celtic 0-1 milan kak√° with the only goal so far at celtic park
worse ajax team in years worse milan team in years . and barca are nowhere near the level without messi . all we needed was a goalscorer
celtic vs ac milan samaras vs balotelli 'or samaras for world player of the year !
how good is it seeing kaka playing in an ac milan top again . don't care what anyone says , pure class act he is 
good to see barca fucking up for celtic again exactly like they tried to against benfica last year as well
half-time scores : 1 - 0 marseille , basel 0 - 0 , 0 - 1 ac milan . ajax 2 - 0 barcelona 
certain celtic fans shaming there club again in europe ? 
make dem even beat porto chelsea schalke milan make we know say all of us don lose

absolutely shite celtic
nice play from bonena at the first half . secures the milan's defense line experiencely .

ajax doing the impossible . if they pull through today they have a chance of making it to the next round with one game left against milan .
 scored yet again :) he loves 
losing to the worst milan team in the past 15 years , painful to say the least . showing us up for what we really are 
good first half milan same again in the second please an there will be no tims in europe !!!
kaka pure class running the show celtic doing fuck all and ajax winning 2 nil could this night get any worse
get yerself to fuck celtic and bin that fucking dross zonal defending too !
celtic have been awful so far . get stokesy on ! commons has been awful
celtic will need a genuine miracle to get through now
milan are winning everything 
celtic are fucking dreadful . that samaris ( ? ) dude is slow & shit . hope they prove me wrong n beat milano 2-1
ancora impresso nella mente " you'll never walk alone " il celtic park mette i brividi ! 
aghhhhh how are celtic losing , milan are shite man !
there are no reported police actions/riots tonight in amsterdam . what has changed since last game ? oh wait no celtic fans !
celtic every bit as toothless as the ajax game so far . and heading out of europe with a game to spare .
in serie a milan is tangible cats but not in the champions league , milan is a lion !!
enjoying watching kaka in a milan shirt again
poor celtic , feel in control despite wide gaps continuously appearing at the back ! no clinical edge about us at all
magic double for any brave gamblers !! barca and celtic to win double ¬£1 pays ¬£110 well worth a pint i wud say
good first half milan ! more energy abeg
celtic defending for goal hahaha
great 1st half of football from ajax there , looked at them at 6s but decided against it ! wanker ! hope celtic draw and ajax manage to hold on
ajax beating barca if celtic don't win we are out
watching celtic v ac milan . celtic 1 goal down . only going to be one winner and it won't be celtic

charlie mulgrew is a total disgrace .. he should go and play for patrick , aberdeen what ever . not 
minta link streaming celtic vs ac milan dong ?
decided to watch celtic v milan .. 
.. ht . celtic 0 -1 milan
nobody looking for the ball , the defender looking to play it forward gets the criticism . f sakes . defenders are celtic's creative players .
deliveries terrible but even with good ones is there any point with just samaras in there . as for the milan goal , awful defending .
celtic better be much better and on the ball after half time and commons what's up with him tonight üò±
half-time : 0-1 / 
hahahaha as things stand its ciao celtic , hope it stays like that .. if they do win come back , i hope ajax v barca stays the same 
celtic vs . milan is the best game to watch i think , dortmund vs . napoli not bad more important for two good teams
celtic were atrocious in the first half ! milan are all over them . time to get the led out for the second half lads !

emilio playing out his skin

this milan side look like they could be easily rattled . celtic need to come out fired up in the second half . 
half time : celtic 0 - 1 milan . goal scorer : kak√† ( 13 ' ) 
kaka and balotelli on fire tonight . need a big second half to remain in europe given ajax lead 2-0 against barcelona . 
celtic need europe really since they're walking the league again .
fuck celtic ! they don't deserve to be in this competition . if swans were in a league like the spl they qualify for it every year ! 
wastefulness and a lack of conviction in front of goal has undermined celtic's champions league campaign ... they need that to change now .
poor display by celtic first half ! milan aren't playing well but still winning !
half time ... celtic 0-1 milan . kaka the goal scorer ! <3
celtic squad isn't good enough , simple as that really
for the record , we give hee haw what the scores are in the other matches . celtic need to win this match ! 
half time celtic 0-1 ac milan and as far as i know , ajax are beating barcelona 2-0 -maggie-
barca need to win , not just for celtic but for all accumulators to
milan caught a few breaks but overall a good 1st half . still we'll need a stronger performance for a win 
celtic park 2.0
so frustrating to watch , we just lack any quality in the final third , whats even worse is this is a poor milan team
fuckin terrible celtic !
another gifted goal from celtic , really need to sort out the final ball in the 2nd half and just go for it
celtic better get the finger out
bad bad goal to give away celtic . 
2-0 ajaxüò≥ ? barca must've fell out with celtic
again evident celtic lack a relentless goalscorer keeper outstanding defence great solid midfield spoilt for choice striker 
cesc gets his 3rd yellow card in the champions league this season and is suspended for the last group game , against celtic . 
if serie a teams allowed ac milan as much space as celtic are then the rossoneri wouldn't be three points from the relegation zone .
no celtic is still losing .
i swear bar√ßa be losin on purpose to screw milan
good first half .. milan is different in <33 
ajax need celtic to best milan and then beat milan lose to ajax
celtic are no match for milan tonight 
what's funny is the scumbag uefalona fans are enjoying there defeat to ajax . reason ? that will make milan's life difficult . lol 
said before celtic would need very best performance of group stage . not remotely good enough so far . milan better than many thought .
cant believe celtic are getting bet üò°
another bang out of order display from the celtic support again tonight ! two games in a row they've flew banners idolising ira terrorists !
kaka will never score an easier goal but celtic have played well since 
just shows how bad celtic are , having samaras as the spearhead of there attack yet he couldn't even get into city's infamous 07-08 team
kris commons is annoying 
sell our best players in the summer and replace them with dross , and people are surprised we get our arses handed to us ? 
celtic please
celtic get your asses into gear and score you already buggered up my couponüò§üëä
come on milan !
ht : celtic 0-1 milan . giving milan a free header in the box we all know just cant be done .
aww well maybe celtic did have a ridiculous ' display ' then
rip barca ... chelsea dey dull ... arsenal and dortmund be careful ... fuck milan , they're goin to win
celtic disappoint meüò≠üò¥
celtic need a strong second half . 0-1 milan . 
quality striker seriously lacking in this celtic team especially in champs campaign .
kaka scoring twice for milan . money can't buy happiness , he's home now !
ajax two nil up against barca . milan 1 nil up against us from a shit goal . the refs a twat . üëä looks like we are going out of europe . * sigh * üò°
not a bad first half from milan , but the midfield is a bit shaky , montolivo not that good
2-0 ajax against barca üòµ not what the celtic fans wanted to hear üòú
kaka has run the show in the first half here . celtic need to give samaras better service 2nd half . milan dangerous on counter attack .
shock i've got celtic and barca on my coupon 
not sure what celtic are getting at there , with the william wallace - bobby sands comparison .
last kick of the ball , commoms is 1st celtic player to get ball past first man ! unfortunately it goes miles out the park !
bang average celtic . weve seen off better teams than this milan side tonight
still in this game though . need to get in about it in the second half ! come on celtic !
every team in this group are a shadow of what they were . celtic , it pains me , are definitely the poorest of the lot . just no quality .
ht : milan lead 1-0 over celtic thanks to ricky kaka's goal !
can't believe how one sided this match has been , best performance from celtic i've seen in a long time , just cannot finish at all , 0-1
celtic need to get over it
and thats the end of the line for celtic , disappointment again but not shocked considering the team thats left .
tlwof update : celtic player ' sex assault ' arrest
this milan team is the worst i ever remember seeing . üé£
milan actually winning wow
celtic out , ha .
ahhhh c'mon celtic , this killie fan wants you to win ! scottish fitbaaa needs ye here !
even ac milan is winning .
cmon the hoops turn it around for the fans just like the last time 
i would say that celtic are dominating but milan can counter attack well so i dont know what the out come will be . c'mon the hoops 
need a miracle in the second half and naw just in the celtic game ! !!
celtic playing well high line looks dodgy
if ajax had played like this against celtic they would have won easily instead of drawn .
celtic losing in europe again but nobody say anything about them , they have an atmosphere there you see ...
poor performance should have bought better players in the summer not they poor cheap alternatives 
why are people watching basel vs chelsea when they could be watching celtic vs milan ?
ac milan have easily been the the best team here in the cl . kaka superb .
well celtic are out . never scoring twice against an italian team . gift of a goal we gave them
very poor from celtic . back to bog standard spl , worst milan team in the past 10 years , not won a game in 5 and they're beating us 
 drawing and celtic loosing at ht 
half time : celtic o - milan 1
 0-1 . half-time . forza !
dirk and beram had two glorious chances to open the scoring . kaka didn't need asking twice . 
kaka is a beast , thank god he joined milan , he's playing like a legend
should i hope that milan win but alle will stay or milan loose and alle out ?
pure pish fuck all up front .... come on celtic
ac 1-0 celtic
 well that was verging , but not quite , pish ... canny see where a goal is going to come from , 2-0 ajax and the wooden spoon awaits
grande kaka per milan . kaka stepping up showing them class is permanent . getting back to his old milan ways .
ooft . think barcelona have money on celtic goin out
are you ready to walk ? milan , paris , new york .
 ht celtic 0-1 ac milan kaka` celtic poor poor poor aza hh
forrest is such a passenger in at celtic team .

celtic player ' sex assault ' arrest : celtic player james forrest has been arrested in connection with an alleged sexual assault , polic ...
as a non old firm fan , i want celtic to do well in europe for scotland , but at the same time , i really couldn't give a fuck .
ht : all 3 still down 1-0 . celtic the most likely to come good for us , they've been strong . marseille should be 2 or 3 down .
if it stays like this , celtic will be out of european football . ouch , but like every year , next season will be theirs . again . yawn
a comeback from celtic and second half goals from marcello trotta , zavon hines and ryan lowe would this a very memorable night !
love when celtic fans go on about rangers no signing catholics until mo johnston as rangers were the dominant team in scotland before the .
we will still win this ! milan are shit and we gave them a gift of a goal . 2nd half we will tear them apart ! mon the hoops ! 
celtic need a win
celtic are fucked .
half-time scores : 1 - 0 marseille , basel 0 - 0 , 0 - 1 ac milan . ajax 2 - 0 barcelona
fucking hell . just seen ajax barca score . well and truly out now ! 
out tonight to celebrate the nearly finished essay and more importantly , the crowning of champions " outer milan ". 1time
said it once al say it again ther are too many shite players in tht celtic team !
celtic should be atleast drawing !
as much as i love to see barcelona losing ( lol) , ajax winning doesn't help milan's situation at all . making the ajax-milan match decisive
i want barca to win or atleast get a draw because that will favour kaka's milan !
commons by far worst player on park in first half . celtic need a change .
nah c'mon celtic , we have to win this
very surprisingly milan have kept samaras quiet . celtic unable to get much service to him also 
come on celtic big second half needed ! 
that's as poor a goal i've ever seen celtic concede . i've seen them give away some poor goals .
nothing going to plan ( including ajax) . unlike last season we have no cutting edge . hard to take as milan are crap . 
arsenal are winning , ajax are winning , and celtic are getting beat . champions league tuesday is going smoothly so far !
celtic player ' sex assault ' arrest 
think have been extremely wasteful . commons is overweight and forrest won't ever be able to cross a ball . such a poor team üçÄ
kaka just looks right in the black and red of ac milan . different gravy that lad , i always wanted fergie to rescue him from real .
fucking shite celtic c'mon pick it up
absolutt muligheter her , celtic
a comeback from celtic and second half goals from marcello trotta , zavon hines and ryan lowe would make this a very memorable night !
ht : milan lead 1-0 over celtic thanks to ricky kaka's goal ! -ms
what if barcelona are playing bad on purpose so that milan doesn't go through 16 ?? you heard it here first . 
however ... the aberdeen game must be fresh in the mind . doable . 
ac milan- celtic 1-0
half time : arsenal 1-0 marseille ; dortmund 1-0 napoli ; basel 0-0 chelsea ; celtic 0-1 milan 
milan are no great shakes either , but they have a proper centre forward and a creative genius in midfield , we have neither !
fucking hate celtic . fucking hate fenians . fucking hate the pope
i think that's celtic out completely !
celtic's crossing , shooting and marking has been abysmal ; i don't think anyone even moved for milan's goal .
big champions league game for celtic and they do a display about bobby sands . how embarrassing ?
saying that .. theres a long way to go and with celtic you always have to believe and keep the faith 
seeing the love theo really has for celtic is lovely . i might be deaf , but it's nice
crazy first halfs of champions league . chelsea sucks . celtic park falling down . yes kaka . ajax spanking barcelona . come on napoli
kaka looking like ' 05 against celtic ..
fuck celtic and fuck barca
not looking good for celtic . ajax 2-0 up as well
quick summary from reading on twitter : -barcelona awful -chelsea awful -arsenal awful -milan awful
celtic are terrible . can't defend or attack ... champions league ? you are having a laugh 
looks like lennon has copied levein's 4-6-0 tactics coz i can't see a striker in that team . lawell has cost celtic dearly by not giving nl ¬£
ht thoughts : celtic playing okay but deserve to be banned from european football for at least 5 years for that defending for the milan goal
come on chelsea , ‚Äò give that the spirit‚Äô . wd also like celtic to ‚Äò gtts‚Äô . a giant of a club , but knockout stages nowadays a huge achievement .
i'm sorry to say it bit every fucking time i watch celtic play in europe we struggle like fuck ! we have no class in are team !
celtic are playing awful and posh are losing again ...
nowhere near enuf quality v the poorest milan team i've seen . not surprised , but doesn't lessen the frustration . 
suddenly my twitter is all ac milan fans üò¥‚úä
fucking dire 
half-times in the cl , and lead 1-0 , though mesut ozil has also missed a penalty . are 1-0 down to .
do the " green brigade " ever just have a supportive banner towards celtic , always controversial !
this is why i'm a pessimist because every time i get a tinge of optimism , it gets shoved right back in my face ! screw life/football/celtic !
fs i really need celtic
gift for kaka and ac milan ........ free header !!!!
mulgrew in midfield is not working , he needs 4 touches before deciding what to do 
all those fickle milan fans who criticise balotelli at every oppportunity are yet to compliment an excellent 1st half from him ( 1/2 )
that celtic team couldn't cross the word . terrible wing play .
celtic looking dodgy at the back , then again so is ac's keeper . a win is still on the cards ! 
celtic need to pull the finger out
come on milan just two more goals , that can't be to much to ask for !! 
soft goal but doin well .. must win .. hail hail 
celtic just need one man alfred finbogason not kevin doyle
one a the biggest halfs a fitba comin up in a long long time celtic fur a number a reasons
how good has kaka been ? bloody hell . the defending for that milan goal was shocking though , i picked out at least 4 mistakes
i wish i could watch the milan game they never put ac milan games on the channels i have
come on de fuck 
celtic
horrible horrible goal for celtic to give away at this level . nothing between the sides but that has given milan the joy of sitting back .
am i right in thinking that if ajax and milan win , celtic are out of europe all together ? no chance of even the europa ?
tonight of all nights kaka reminds the world he was once worth 56m ! poor half . need to turn this around 2nd half ! 
i just realized that ajax is the third and the difference between them and milan is a single point ! :o
some positives in that first half for milan . bit sloppy at times and probably can't afford to be wasteful again in second .
blame the ref because we're totally outclassed and out of our depth ! why not ask lawwell about that at the agm ? 
celtic fans are embarrassing
celtic and rangers fans ruin celtic games and rangers games for me
fabregas was yellow carded in the 39th minute and therefore will be unavailable for the next match against celtic at camp nou . 
at the end of the campaign celtic are still going to get a hefty sum of money , there's always a silver lining somewhere !
kaka just superb to watch . celtic ? eh , not so much .
celtic 0 - 1 milan a very entertaining first half has seen the very impressive kaka give milan the edge and celtic must win - hail hail !!
that came out wrong . ajax need celtic to beat milan . while ajax needs to beat milan in order to move on
celtic could be out the europa league as well tonight ! 
see if celtic had someone good at football , that would be cracking
looking like another one those nights , frustrating performance again from an attacking point of view . c'mon celtic
watching the arsenal game on tv and the celtic game on my phone , best of both worlds
dear celtic defenders fook this zonal shite jist mark a man auld skool style
come on to fuck celtic !!!
did anybody see that zone heed the ball in the back a net and put milan 1 nil up ? nah , same lot a pish . 
celtic one down at half time . can they turn it around in the second 45 ? 
kaka of milan >>> messi of barca >> ronaldo of madrid 
i cringe every time i see celtic haven't been kicked out of the 
barca fans always say how big a team are when they lose to them like celtic but when madrid crush a team like galatasaray " they suck "
celtic have lacked the spark this year , no drive from midfield
celtic loosing
though both arsenal v marseille & celtic v milan weren't bad but wish i had watched ajax vs barca instead . 
thought that celtic might fancy it tonight , obviously not
i hope i'm wrong , but celtic have no chance here : their technique is poor , and they're doing milan's defending for them .
lacking a bit of quality when we get forward , had some half chances , milan looking dangerous hitting us on break
2-0 for ajax against barcelona and 1-0 for milan against celtic ! 
fair to say , simply through this celtic live at parkhead , i can update you all that i'm about to fall asleep at a live champions league game
arsenal , ac milan , dortmund and ajax leading at half time ! barca 2 goals down .....
worst european performance at celtic park i've seen for a whole . need to be a lot better in 2nd half
looked shocking defending . celtic need to get the finger out . no one looks like scoring . mulgrew should of put that a way ! finger out !!
milan had 51% possession in the first half . 7 shots on goal , 1 on target . milan players also made 17 successful tackles "
celtic will not go through .
james forest ? kris commons ? joe ledley ? where are you guys ? there's a game at park . your missing it .
how comes there's 5 empty seats at celtic park ?
massive second half needed for celtic here . 17/2 celtic 33/10 draw 4/11 ac milan
can someone please tell me the celtic score !
one good pass will open milan up , bring pukki on for borrighter and move samaras out to the left , ambrose needs more urgency 
the lack of a striker is causing us massive problems , chances have been made but we look toothless in the last 3rd . 
i'd stake a large amount of money that half the people on here offended by celtic fans don't even know what they're offended about .
ugh jay supports celtic as well , that just makes me mushy inside
01a prob go to celtic park more than you to see killie play and you support them haahahaha
and with that celtic are out of the champions league
supporters are going to have to fall in love with scottish football again , because we're one game away from having nothing but . 
com on milan put these fuds oot 
only watched celtic for five minutes and i can't watch anymore so fucking shite can't even cross the ball
basically we need barca to score 3 and us to score 2 in 45 mins without conceding 
everyone goes on about the atmosphere at celtic park . the fans are pish when they are getting beat . look at dortmund vs bayern for top fans
odds on ajax dortmund milan porto and schalke to win/draw
watching is so exciting in the . would be so funny if celtic is able to turn the game .
that corner was so slack from celtic
celtic always make it hard for themselves üò¥
don't think celtic are done yet . forrest will be looking to pull it back in the second half .
celtic have created some good chances in the first half , bring on amido the fenian gangster
want to watch the milan game
if anything , ajax have done what we did last season . which is more frustrating as they're worse than milan .
god awful from .
lol at barca as well . shouldn't be relying on favours anyway , get the fucking finger out celtic .
think celtic can kiss europe good bye haha
2 nil ajax . didn't see that coming ! 
celtic are fully aware of the green brigade's motivations & complicit in condoning their banners , songs & actions in the name of atmosphere .
maybe africa could have a rock concert in aid of funds for a celtic striker ? fucking . hell .
celtic terrible tonight so far , samaras , commons and forrest a disgrace so far once again . we need to duplicate the back four x 1.5 .
get the fucking finger out celtic !!!!
i can't help but watch kaka everytime he plays for milan !
if the results hold in group h , that ajax-ac milan match in a few weeks should end up a winner takes all affair . 
hopefully milan doesn't play barca in the knockout round again !
okay , celtic are getting played off the park , but they're miles ahead in the male grooming stakes . 'oreal
couldn't be happier with kaka scoring for ac milan and barca losing 2-0 to ajax ‚öΩÔ∏è
still in it though . lennon will boot thir bawz right noo & sort it oot ! 
 win today will screw ac milan ... which eventually lead to allegri sacking !!
so far the today cl winners are ajax , bvb , milan and arsenal , goals by reus ( p) , wilshere , hoesen , serero and kaka .
why can't celtic sign someone that can cross a ball and someone who can stick the ball in the goals ..?
i honestly wonder were celtic will score 2 goals no fuckin threat uptop !
that must be the poorest ac milan team every , so slow and can't pass a ball to each other , apart from kaka and dejong .
milan's home üëèüò© i've missed her !
imagine celtic had a player with any composure whatsoever
celtic are playing good football
celtic getting beat , ajax 2-0 up , no european football after christmas for us üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ 
boerrigter , pukki , biton , balde , or finnbogason ? am so fuckin mad right now , milan are the shittest in there history .
shitey performance so far by being beaten by a poor team
not a doom merchant but stating a few facts here : 1 . appalling goal to concede , 2 . this is the worst milan team in my living memory 
seeing as how ajax are humping barcelona past their best right now , celtic shouldn't assume they can't win at barca
mi-temps : 0 - 1 but de forza 
there's no dig in this celtic midfield
barca losing to ajax would only create problems for milan since barca have almost qualified
missed the celtic match ... oh :(
i am currently at a celtic only pub in orlando !!!! i am in heaven
half time at celtic park .. or allegri thinking of ways to screw his team's lead time
come on celtic if we get one we will get a few have the faith üçÄcoybigüçÄ
dont usually criticise celtic but they dont have any other ideas than bad crossing to poor strikers tonight
 quand le milan a gagner 2-0 contre le barca .
it's 2-1 to knaresborough town . celtic opened the scoring after 2 mins and have been impressive but town have taken control
poor 1st half celtic 2believe
forsters impression of a 6ft 7in statue for the milan goal was unbelievable , completely motionless !
samaras is pish 
if we start falling over in the second half , the ref will surely give us free kicks galore . worked for milan in the first half .
close section 111 immediately . they blacken the good name of celtic with their socialist idealogical pish . bores me to death 
hopefully the secound half celtic will get it together n put a few goals behind that net hh 
not a bad first half from celtic but jesus they cant cross for shit ! 
celtic have been dreadful in the champs league this year in my opinion ! nobody to put the ball in the net either 
final ball has been dreadful throughout this champions league campaign 
so i take it the sfa and spfl are ok with celtic fans waving banners supporting terrorists . 
if milan wins and ajax wins , milans gonna be 1st en la tabla
no final ball , no quality . very poor 
what exactly does james forrest bring to the celtic team ?
i hope either juve or milan wins the champions league
pull yourself the fuck together celtic
crying at the celtic game
poor show so far . balance is all wrong . feared the worst when i saw the team . can't be that open in champions league 
everything seems pretty hopeless right now for celtic . not one for losing hope completely though .
in the 42nd minute ajax has gone 2-0 up against barcelona . for celtic this is starting to look like time to aim for europa league
dont get it unless commons is going for goal its got to be mulgrew . set pieces been poor . even tho we are chasing not too many milan chances
people need to realise celtic urny good enough to compete in the champs league ! great home support that's it ! stop getting your hopes up !
half time scores : ajax 2 barcelona 0 , celtics 0 ac milan 1 , basel 0 chelsea 0 , arsenal 1 marselle 0 
mon bhoys believe 
just once i wish we'd attack through the middle rather than wide . we're absolutely shite . milan aren't much better .
lennings pish zonal marking , van dijks pish no marking , celtic fans are pish clapping kaka . away to the san siro ya italian wanks
ht : basel 0 - 0 chelsea ht : celtic 0 - 1 ac milan torres
some celtic fans need to realise we are punching well above our weight in the cl . back the team .
what game to watch in the second half :/ celtic vs ac ?? ajax vs barca ??
right celtic finger oot here . if wur goin oot lets go oot fighting . how about testing this goalie oot for starters he looks rid rotten
don't know of it's coming across on tv but this is a very poor milan team , poor shape off the ball look very unorganised
don't know how celtic are losing this game , we've played well in first half but just one stupid mistake is costing us
sooo excited to be in milan tonight to see my favoriteesss ‚ò∫Ô∏è
c'mon celtic need a big improvement n the 2nd half !! we can do this !! üíöüçÄ‚öΩ
 1 - 0 et
mcneil , mcstay , aitken , all great captain for celtic ! then u have big sammy ! somebody is having a hee haw here !
shite first half , lets pick it up celtic 
celtic it's been always a dream too far i'm afraid ..
how do celtic fans get away with the banners they display !? if it was rangers it would be a completely different story !
what i can summarise from that opening 45 , arsenal are good , marseille are bad , milan are average , celtic defend like a sunday league side
ac milan arsenal ajax dortmund austra vienna all lead the way as chelsea schalke04 draw ht score ...... ucl updates
worst possible result in amsterdam for celtic !! biggest 45 of the season ! hope they get the goals and take it to the last game !
currently at the celtic game waiting on my english my mums pal marked . cutting edge a fuckin tell you
the past two games ' performances ' from the green brigade must pose the question who at celtic park checks what they are bringing in ?
idk why milan can't perform this well in serie a ...
 have been awful . the tactics are really starting to get to me . get it wide and cross it ... we've got zero plan b .
kaka is just sublime to watch . his control & movement are just perfect üëå 
kaka shouldn't of left ac milan in the first place ! üôå‚öΩÔ∏è
celtic trying but no end product so far .
celtic are the most frustrating team to watch , i'm patching it after this game
first time milan fishing the first half with advance .... lol i don't believe this
iv watched celtic for long enough to know in 45 mins we will turn this mob over ... 3-1 us ... eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeasy .
hearing that kaka scored for milan makes me happy
couldn't really be going any worse for celtic .. 
bet 2 all win chelsea ( d ) dortmund ( w ) porto ( l ) barca ( l ) schalke ( d ) arsenal ( w ) milan ( w )
more annoyed at celtic , letting kaka scored a header , what is that all about .
 goal looked bad at the time , ten times worse with every replay . obviously thought zonal marking also applied to him 
such a poor goal to concede celtic .
milan keeping it simple , pass to the feet and we keep dive in . #1950'sstyle
a bit insensitive of celtic to sell kfc and allow a bobby sands banner into piradise tonight ! 
keep calm , support ac milan & worship kaka ' .
ajax beating barca and celtic getting beat üòÇ
too many pessimistic fans on my timeline ! -timers
milan #1 celtic #0
putain le celtic ... gerer pour mes thunes please
yet another shocking champions league performance from celtic
my mon said if tiffany acm get them yes to vip djskkdb
on the other hand celtic is poor no other way to say it
with ajax beating barca 2-0 , anything short of us winning tonight and against barca will not be enough . let's win tonight then . 
that's one celtic fan blocked for tweeting a load of pish
c'mon celtic !
it's crazy bumping into people from the past telling them i watch celtic as a neutral now , and i'm around the world running from now on üòÑüòÑüèÉüëç
celtic are poor üò∂
need to watch celtic game with the sound off , davie provan is so fucking bias
cmon celtic 2 is a big ask but at paradise dreams come true if u fucking play !!!! 
i think we'll see a different celtic half time . 
 playing well and lead at half time but have at least one goal in them . this game is far from over . 
crap 1st half by celtic . such a soft goal to concede . hope lennon gives them a bollicking , the players deserve it .
when milan had schevchenko , those were the days
some huns are properly obsessed with celtic though
ajax and celtic fighting 4 the europa spot !!!!!
great display from the fans tonight . all those deluded huns can fuck up . yous don't know what you're talking about ...
if shall continue to perform so poorly , then i think he doesn't deserve to be captain
kaka will be starting to think he can score againt celtic anytime he wants
primo tempo .. celtic 0 : 1 milan .. am sure the italian are delighted with the current score and wish the game could end now
plenty of time left . need boerrigter on the ball more because he has the beating of abate . celtic playing well just gave away a stupid goal .
anyone knows manu caloia from milan . now lives in london 
james forrest getting dun with sexual assault hahaha , just sums up glasgow celtic football club
celtic must score mannnnnn !
man , baba milan had a crap first half .
situazione temporanea girone h : barcellona 10 milan 8 ajax 7 celtic 3 
celtic not looking bad going forward , but we're too sloppy too often and look shaky when milan counterattack .
greetin at this tommy burns video man üò¢ 
come on bhoys ! 
awesome milan .
forza milan .
blaming forster too easy -back 4 at fault . every defender worth his salt knows if your keeper doesn't call , you attack the ball . 
& on the single celtic 0-1 down after playing really well .
soso from celtic . playing not that bad but no final product
milan sucks
shocking celtic ! words can't describe how poor some of those performances were . massive rocket needed .
awain milan doesn't deserve the lead :) f3eeeeeeeeeeeenik
milan needs to win today so they can stay 2nd in the group to make it to the knock out round
need bradford to turn it around barca & celtic goal
updates ac milan vs celtic 1-0 at half . under 2.5 -135 is the play . napoli vs borussia 1-0 at half . under 3 -120 is the play .
kaka rolling back the years tonight . celtic rolling back the years aswell , it's like watching that donkey evander sno all over again .
wow very poor defending by celtic for milan's goal
i do hope this celtic v milan match is a game of two halves .
okay milan got the lead >> ‚òë
all over milan and getting beat ... deja vu
milan play 4-3-2-1 x-mas formation ... to celebrate christmas i guess n so far it works ... 
we play 90 minutes not 45 ! come on celtic get fucking intae them !!!!
celtic are just unlucky , they are playing decent tonight
goal that celtic conceded was absolutely woeful
aht milan ur pish , pollok could play them aff the pitch
this celtic match is gonna give me a fecking heart attack , milan look like scoring every chance they get ,
ht celtic 0-1 ac milan . not good enough from celtic . need to bu up their ideas if they want anything from this match .
barcelona losing to ajax :o not good for celtic
kindergarten defending from celtic for kaka's header , not even funny just plain terrible
you go from the celtic game with the atmosphere blaring out like your there , then you change to arsenal and it's like a library ...
terrible defending by celtic !
come on to fuck celtic ! there's no way in hell i'll be able to stomach those dutch cunts finishing above us 
celtic , why you do this ?
that defending from celtic is disgraceful van dijk and samaras static , kaka didn't have to move an inch
terrible marking from celtic for the milan goal
what's funny is the scumbag uefalona fans are enjoying their defeat to ajax . reason ? that will make milan's life difficult . lol 
spectacular comebacks from celtic and barcelona on the way . mon the hoops .
great to see kaka back to his best at milan ... top player
mon celtic and neymar time to do us a favour üôè 
ac milan for finals @2duk day dreaming . lol
barca losing to ajax .. and milan winning !!! goal by kaka . .. and there's no school til monday ! turn up . or nah ?
milan really wind me up . 2nd time this season we've outplayed them and still went behind . can't blame them like but really annoying
barcelona wan cause go-slow for ac milan
that defending from celtic somehow gets worse every time you see it . yezus .
milan are not a great side but they have scored 3 goals against us over 2 games so far whilst we are playing the better football alegedly
just seem the milan goal , hilarious defending from celtic .
even ross mcmillan could've defended that corner 
come on celtic that's pish !! get into them !!!
why can't ajax play this good against milan ?
i like celtic , but their fans are deluded . not best fans in the world not even close , can't say use are because of cl atmosphere .
come on celtic , better improve in the 2nd half !!!!!
how bad is that defending from celtic haha , kaka just stood still
this is what happens when you play a goalie , 4 defenders and 6 midfielders . crying out for a decent striker 
bit of a rumble over the celtic banner tonight , something out of nothing really
will the glasgow media outlets acknowledge the mistake of fraser forster for the milan goal ? he's their wee darling afterall .
is this ref taking the piss ... as soon as a milan player is tickled its a foul . 
lets be honest celtic how the fuck can u lose a goal like that
pique n his deflections ... same agaisnt milan
think celtic will score hopefully early in 2nd half
ac milan leading against celtic ( 1-0)‚úî dortmund leading against napoli ( 1-0 ) ‚úî arsenal leading against marseille ( 1-0)‚úî
john collins doesn't think ac milan deserve their lead ... what a surprise( ! )
the italians being particularly italian . the referee being particularly ' refereeish '. grow up celtic . this is the champions league !!!!
maybe one day celtic will have a banner saying something like " up the hoops " or " come on celtic "
the way some fans saying it's getting harder for milan . fucking despise you to eternity . it's your club losing . that's what matters most atm !
celtic fix up we need these 3 points !!!!
old skulls celtic the fak fak messiz barca !! üòïüòï
bye bye celtic
can you imagine if ajax manage to qualify in 2nd with milan topping the group
i get the feeling barca is letting ajax get the better of them to make next ajax/milan match more interesting ..
germanic , slavic and celtic . we should all beef each other
disgraceful scenes as the entire celtic squad wear balaclavas and patrol the pitch , armed with assault rifles , shooting everyone in sight .
have you ever seen worst defending from a set piece than that milan goal !!?
are we trying to bore ac into submission ? 
kaka up to his old tricks again . just didnt fit in at madrid 
barca and celtic better get a move on ... üòîüíöüôèüçÄ
celtic fans glorifying ira terrorism yet again , how can the media not see through this 
valmir berisha : " the clubs who have shown the biggest interest are ajax , milan , liverpool and tottenham . they've all offered me contracts ."
ac milan don't deserve to be a head
seeing that goal again really doesn't make forster look good at all !! got to be coming for that an cleaning out the box !! 
never been more frustrated watching 45 mins of celtic play .. doesn't help with ajax thrashing barca . need a miracle now .
arsenal , milan , wolves , brentford and orient winningüëå just need chelsea to score !
milan 1 up ... barca 2 down .. naoli goal down .. bvb leading ... arsenal 1 up as usual .. chelsea n basel no goals .. hmm .. 
champions league half-times : basel 0-0 chelsea , arsenal 1-0 marseille , celtic 0-1 ac milan
celtic 0 milan 1 final zenit 1 a . madrid 1
says a lot about you & your own club when the highlight of your week is watching a team you hate ( celtic ) play europe's giants in the cl .
that was awful defence from celtic for that goal . zonal marking doesn't work
ajax winning 2-0 ? i could be wrong but aren't celtic fecked now ?
come on celtic ! still second half to play !!
i just hope milan qualifies instead of ajax .
celtic are gonna let me down !!
acmilan vs celtic 1-0
celtic are so shit this year in the champions league makes me feel sick
get anthony stokes on 
barca never do celtic any favours . 2-0 down ? when does this ever happen ? fs
hey dortmund and celtic , please score two goals in second half .
borreighter chance was a shocking miss . really should have scored 
barca are catalan fascist wanks milan are italian wanks , ajax are ditch wanks celtic are love everybody clap apposing playres shitebag wanks
half-time result in other game in group h : celtic-milan 0-1 
finishing off celtic would be a great gift 
celtic vs ac milan . 0-1 . mon the hoops , second half is yours .
im watching the celtic vs ac milan game , i tell you what celtic play beautiful football !
kaka looks at home in milan . showed glimpses of quality . though this milan side isn't even the shadow of its past self .
bruhhhh if ajax take the w today and so does milan barca prob won't even make it past group stage lmaooooo
1-0 for ac milan at half-time 
barcelona and celtic , not a good day
they were lucky to beat 10 man celtic ..
easy to blame zonal marking for celtic losing the goal , but there was a group man-marking too . equally as slack .
were celtics defence playing musical statues for the milan goal ?
celtic love zonal marking .
and now that we're all but out of europe we're not signing anyone in january . it's gonna be a long second half of the season 
3/4's of that celtic team are stealing a wage . might dust of my copa's and give that helmet lennon a buzz .
celtic and barca are currently fuckin my other one for 753 aye it's awryt am cool way all this yenoüòí
horrible defending from celtic
great marking from celtic in kaka's goal .
perhaps , just perhaps , some celtic fans could go to a game and support their team rather than using it as a pathetic political platform .
so poor from celtic . shocking defence and nowhere near enough desire from anyone . 
morris dancers would have defended better than celtic did against milan .
final ball needs to improve if we are to score in the 2nd half . .
 always and forever ... forza milan !
hang ur heads in shame celtic . no excuse for that 1st half we r playin a poor team at home we should not be behind . 
ac milan , dortmund results going as i'd like
boerrigter looks to be a class player ! 
this celtic team has managed to play so unimaginatively and badly they have killed the atmosphere at cp on a champions league night .
geez imagine milan didn't have kaka this season .
just saw the ac milan goal . fuck sake . poor defending , poor goalkeeping , poor everything .
if a milan win and barca lose , we re back in it to win the first place in our group
sooooooo barca are shit without messi swear even celtic beat ajax ????
celtics vs milan live espn+
andy gray still bitching about juve " manhandling " celtic last season . 
by no means vintage milan but that was the best 45 we've played this season . our fullbacks did brilliantly to block about 80% of crosses .
first thing is that they have a commentator from celtic at the game and no one from and italian club
need this ac milan jersey tho
 took in ¬£45m addtnl this summer . replaced hooper with stokes and wanyama with mulgrew . board happy to take fans cash and bank it
barca pals with celtic this and that embarrassing even saying that you play to win games for your club nobody else's
celtic have sold the fans short , mediocre players to win the spl but never good enough to compete at the big table .
i took celtic seriously when they nakamura and venegoor of hesselink
if group h half-time results persist at full time , celtic will be completely out of european football this season * sobs ( with laughter )*
celtic couldn't buy a goal . purely because the board wouldn't pay for one . 5 games , 2 goals . a penalty and a deflection .
half time at celtic park
awkward how the german presenter said ac milan are 1-0 up against glasgow hah .
love watching celtic's missed chances
montolivo is shit man ac milan caring too many passengers
so glad kaka scored for milan . an angel from above .
kaka ! saving milan with his goal
15 mins in 4 decisions already for ac milan , cant be fair
arsenal are winning and celtic fucking arney ... am happy
omg barca is losing to ajax and milan's winning celtic ‚ù§Ô∏è‚öΩÔ∏è
 ‚öΩÔ∏è
up the celtic
 are winning , penalty , ajax are up 2-0 against barcelona , and kaka scored to put milan 1-0 . you could say today is an amazing day
sky sports just told me that " ac mailand " is winning 1-0 against celtic
keys " i think the last time barcelona lost a champions league match was against celtic ". they lost 7-0 on aggregate to munich !
need a massive half from celtic , chelsea and cheltenham
ajax are putting barca to the sword ! celtic are putting milan , well ive not got a good metaphor but they've been piss poor .
celtic , get your finger out
i see the vermin support have their pro ira banners out again . the cunts cry to the if sing a loyalist song . 
bye bye celtic üëã
half-time giveaway : last one of the night !. rt and follow to win a copy of ' sean fallon : celtic's iron man '. winner at start of second half !
not really relevant but is anyone else getting annoyed with the celtic ball boys ? constantly several balls being thrown on the pitch
hey , as long as celtic promises to beat/tie barca and we win this match and next match , ill be fine #1stplaceisforus :p
going to buy the new celtic jackets 
whats that i hear ? nnnnrrrrrrrggggh boom !!!!!!!! is that celtic crashing and burning out of europe ? yes , yes it is .
pub team defending from celtic for that goal , still love kaka 
how are milan beating celtic away haha
what's the celtic score anyone ?
best case scenario is celtic draw and then beat barca just for europa league , this is must win with ajax winning
oh well .. bye bye celtic #üê†
celtic losing at home to a terrible ac milan team
well that's it all over for celtic üí©üò´
ac milan with a perfectly good goal called wrongly offside .. good wee game though
in big trouble now with ajax winning 2 nil and celtic down 1-0 even if we win still don't qualify 
hard to cheer on celtic with kayal in their team . he's such a fanny .
just got into pub from a cuntish day . celtic on but silent .. whats the score ? how we playing ?
lack of conviction in final third from celtic . final ball has been poor . massive 45 mins coming up . need to get the crowd going .
ac milan 
barcelona never do celtic favours ..
 : 0:1 
celtic's lack of a goal scorer is horrid
fuck celtic and barca
celtic 1st half un 1.0 is a push .
can't lose to these cunts . mon celtic
this is a chance for celtic
milan so lucky celtic refused to spend any money on a good striker this season . never seen an italian team invite a team to score like ac do
few celtic players need to show a bit of fucking desire man
if celtic and barca win today i will be the happiest person ever
one thing i've learnt at this celtic game is that football fans are very angry ...
fuck off celtic you useless terrorist cunts
at least milan is winning
would you like to try a cheeseburger bobby sands . fuck off celtic
driven to drink 
honestly you slate celtic so much but i dont see your team get as far hahah sit down and weesht for once you greeting cunt
celtic are out 
celtic chances ? no exactly a ' chance ' when there's nae danger in any of them ?
' time to get yer forrest oot ' shouts in the toilet looking like the highlight of tonight . 
half-time result in other game in group h : celtic-milan 0-1 
yet again what has the banner in the celtic crowd got to do with football ? absolutely nothing .
forster , shite commons , shite pull yer fucking finger out ' tic milan are utter pish
half-time result in other game in group h : celtic-milan 0-1 
come on celtic . score one time !
celtic don't need to worry sammy will come out the second half and tear shit up with his world class ability .......
milan is on the way üíôüôàüë∂
celtic u need to score two cmonnnnnnnnnnn
if celtic win tonight i will run up and down john lang street naked .
live text and audio as chelsea and arsenal look to progress to the knockout stages and celtic take on milan .
anyone that thought celtic were gonna win this are clueless , not 1 decent player in that team
barcelona and celtic better score there now fairly fast
im sure celtic fans dont need reminded , but if the scores stay the same in both games they are out of europe .
second , the celtic commentator said that we don't deserve to be infront . celtic have had like 1 shot and only got through with a deflection .
milan could and should be 2-0 up . an early second half goal would be ideal to take the sting out of a celtic revival at the break .
still got half a game to go , and it doesn't take 45 minutes to score a goal ! c'mon celtic we can pull this back ! üíöüçÄ 
" stay strong , even when it feels like everything is falling apart " acm <3
celtic
kaka should have never left ac milan
ac milan vs celtic is the game to watch la . end to end . kak√° is just a delight to watch 
such a shocking goal for celtic to concede , don't deserve to be down . elsewhere you see how much control barca lack without busquets
honestly , how people can call celtic fans " the best fans in the world " is beyond me ! absolute scumbags !
 j collins must be watching a different game if he thinks have played well ,
would love to watch celtic every week if they were playing in the premier league .
how celtic are losing i don't know . should be at least 2 up by now .
if the results in the group finnish the way they are it will be the worst possible night for celtic !
omfg kaka is killing it at milan agh ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
if only ajax had beaten milan in amsterdam agggghhh .
kaka bringing little life into this dead milan
next 45mins are huge ! come on celtic ! üçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄ
schoolboy defending tf ?
man vs zonal marking debate for the milan goal ? if the keeper collects the ball three yards out from his line he negates the whole issue .
go celtics go !! hope they win against ac milan !!!
kaka and milan are a match made in heaven
looks like celtic heading out haha . good stuff
celtic can only get better ... 2-1 samaras double if the greasy bastard gets his finger out if no it's back to spl
celtic park , i'm bringing down that shii ‚Ñ¢
' we've got to just go for this ' laura brannan 
i really fucking hate celtic supporters
this is pretty much what is wrong with celtic , a banner of wonder woman hahaha
ref costing celtic and barca don't show up in amsterdam , fucking typical .
celtic are sadly losing 0-1 to ac milan at half-time , while chelsea are drawing 0-0 at basel . 
kaka with a goal vs celtic !
took my dad for dinner and to the celtic game and the wee guy is buzzin out his mind 
that defending for the milan goal was up there with the worst defending ive seen ! celtic can still do it though !
kaka scoring for milan ! hope his best days are back
atmosphere in the arsenal game is dead compared to celtic vs milan !!
if results stay as they are , celtic are out of all european football ...
so celtic put up another banner about a terrorist , they wonder why we all hate them the scum ?! !
we need to take advantage oh milan keeper deffo weakest link sammy better get his act together and commons c'mon son goals from you üçÄ
kak√° having a great time at ac milan ‚ò∫
w/o his 2 goals , milan'd have been in the relegation zone . he isn't a world class player , but he still doesn't deserve all this hate . ( 2/2 )
people crying about that celtic banner yeah ?
second half prediction : draw in amsterdam .... win at paradise . 
fiver on chelsea draw arsenal win n celtic draw
if ajax won , milan wont qualify ;(
wee bit of pressure on them and they crack ! mon celtic !
kaka'll turn to milan highest goal scorer dis season
im sure celtic fans dont need reminded , but if the scores stay the same in both games they are out of european football .
excited to see kaka score for ac milan
shocking defending by celtic . what were the defenders thinking ! 
celtic have been waaash tonight . lennon needs to have a look at sj 21's for some talent a think 
kaka has really turned his career around .. shud hav done a year or 2 before though . dont knw why he preferrer to b a benchman . 
talking to an ac milan fan and his wee boy in the celtic end , congratulated their team for turning up . 
celtic's players inability to cross a ball into the box past the first man is actually tragic , simple stuff and we canny even do that
just saw kaka's goal . how not to defend a corner 101 from celtic ! horrific defending . 
orlando pirates , ac milan & italy !
here we go again ... let's hope the referee has had a revelation & realises we aren't all here to watch him ! 
to pay tribute to bobby sands , celtic fans have his picture on a banner at parkhead tonight . me ? chicken supper and a can of coke obviously ."
celtic could rest some players against barcelona ahead of the big clash with hibs .
hopen dat celtic even scoort
that prick andy gray : juve defending ' disgracefully ' against celtic last year has given italian sides bad rep with referees .
the only reason why kaka went back to ac milan was no other than to get back his top form . pushing his way to the world cup as well .
just when will milan concede ?
looking at replays of the goal ... probably the worst defending of a corner i've seen !! kaka didn't even have to run to the ball 
right . me and my dad have it sussed . new prediction : 5-1 celtic , 6-2 barcelona . boomski .
fiver on celtic and barca .
milan 8pts sorry
come on celtic :(
norti first half for my acca that is , need celtic to score and draw for ¬£150 ! üëå 
celtic fans tho
come on celtic
celtic getting outclassed here . kaka , de jong an montolivo been brilliant . be lucky no to get beat by a few . celtic dont have enough quality
mon celtic , this teams for the taking , played them off the park so far
milan winning , ajax winning , and rangers u20s winning . good night so far !
at least ac milan is winning
wee bit of pressure on them and they will crack ! mon celtic !
haaaa kaka just loves that celtic goal man , my man ! 
celtic getting bullied lel
if celtic come back and win i will giveaway 10k to someone who rts this !
so that's celtic out the champions leagueüòÖüòê
fucking shite celtic . not much else to say huff puff prove me wrong . please
that header from kaka was just epic . he was surrounded by like 4 players from celtic bana haha !
i don't understand the celtic banner with the flower of scotland lyric on it and their one tonight for that matter
we're out , but at least we are playing teams like ac milan and not arbroath
 is becoming the lone savior for 
half-time result in other game in group h : celtic-milan 0-1
no wanyama , no threat up front ( hooper) , the summer transfer window was a killer for us 
imagine being a celtic fan , but not into all that h block carry on . tiresome .
good job milan !!!
anyhow kaka is scoring in every game for milan
celtic need a big black guy up front , to fuck some cunts up and score goals
great to see kaka back with milan and doin somethin 
thank god i didn't back celtic !!
green brigade are unconscious morons , celtic should revoke their season tickets , football and politics don't mix !!!
all being well celtic wont even make the europa league 
need to be more clinical played well poor defending from corner c'mon celtic lets do it hail hail
ht celtic vs milan 0-1 
fair play to the celtic fan who dressed up as luigi to meet balotelli at the airport 
c'mon celticüçÄ üôè
so milan are winning till now something is definitely wrong
why the fuck would rangers fans want celtic to do good in europe üòÇüòÇ some people should think before they write stuff man fucking spaz üòã
what's the chances of 2 goals for celtic in the 2nd half ?!
milan haven't won an away game this season
at the end of the day it's not that big of a deal .... added bonus is the cl can get rid of ac milan and celtic which are two dire teams !!
celtic vs ac milan .
still believe we can get something from this game but we have to be more assertive in and around the 18 yard box . üçÄ
highlight of the celtic game so far . stovies in christies ...
bring on bobby petta and didier agathe 
awful defending from celtic . kaka stands there and just heads the ball in to score .
i love milan
see uf celtic fans actually supported the team except for being twats all the timw they might win games
be boss if celtic can do this 
big 2nd half required ! celtic 0 ac milan 1 kaka
celtic will kick themselves if both scores remain
all ac milan players are diving bastards üò°
glad cesc took the yellow card so he'll miss the next match against celtic and not an important match
if we draw and ajax win , the table would be barca 10 , ajax 7 , milan 6 , celtic 4 . ajax could then theoretically top the group .... wow .
see more rangers fans talking about the celtic game than celtic fans 
come on the celticüëä
right 45mins to save our european journey , no one wants it to end celtic , not even those who pretend to hate us ! 
if city got ac milan in the champions league i would fucking cry with happiness
come on celtic , intae these bastards ! no over yet ! 
the goal celtic conceded is a clear indication why zonal marking is bollocks 
meanwhile i love how kaka continues to deliver for his beloved ac milan .
one second of poor defending leaving celtic screwed
2 goals for celtic and barca this half
celtic have the best fan base ! they have so much passion i actually love it so much ! 
i'd say bob crotty would have scored that goal against celtic 
barca down 2-0 and milan up 1-0 at halftime , please don't fuck this up milan ..
oh another celtic banner all over twitter , what a surprise .
and milan is winning
only celtic fans understand the importance of having scott brown in the team
celtic are playing well so far . come on we can do this 
leave all your criticism for the end . still in this . mon celtic
45 minutes to get 2 goals , c'mon celtic
the only downside to the milan half is that we'll still have allegri as coach tomorrow . _ . )
spot-on there eh ... " to win this ... celtic will need to do something in the 2nd half !" 
need celtic and napoli to score !
i think it is going to finish 0-2 milan and 2-1 ajax . done . i so hope i am wrong more than anything but cannot .
chelsea milan arsenal are winning .
mario balotelli wearing black boots this evening . i kid you not ! where does he keep finding this outrageous gear 
cheap goal to lose , horrendous marking . this milan team are nothing special at all , definitely beatable . kaka's still a class act though .
a love celtic
celtic are completely out their depth so far . kayal and mulgrew ( who i like but not at cm ) must be the worst cm partnership in cl ...
milan are so poor atm
given the way celtic have played i've enjoyed the tv3 ad break with cameos from scarlett johansson and megan fox more .
group h ajax 2-0 barcelona [ shock ] celtic 0-1 ac milan [ the game im watching ]
kaka got his early christmas present . i want mine . celtic and barcelona to turn it around . thanks very much 
i live in hope , though . of celtic winning and of me avoiding the bore .
delighted celtic are loosing ! had to go to the pub to watch arsenal cos of those gimps
barca could be the reason for milan not qualifying
people have to realise barca dont give 2 fucks about celtic , nor shud they , look after yourself
don't know what was worst in that first game : milan , celtic or davie provan . dreadful stuff all round .
i dislike some scottish clubs !! only rangers can compete with the best ... celtic fc is just uninspiring please ! off & on
celtic vs milan is the cl equivalent of sunderland vs fulham or ross county vs kilmarnock . two pretty bad teams at this level .
think i'm the only one not having barca in my accume , although i do have celtic 
i'm happy celtic losing cause to see ajax 2-0 up against barca would be soul destroying if we won
celtic need a miracle to make the europa league now
celtic are getting knocked out in the champions league again this week . sadly this time it is on the park . 
if milan is gonna suck in the serie a , i at least need them to go far in the cl
come on milan !!
some of the celtic ' fans ' here tonight are fucking embarrassing man
kakaaaaaa the king is back !!! 2 goals in 2 games 
remember when milan were one of the best teams in europe now there bollocks
milan strolling it . the movement from the players is truly shocking . everyone screaming at izzy for putting crosses in , hes no other options
this is a fucking joke celtic
pique should just be a house husband now and take care of milan . let shakira do her thing .
celtic - we don't press the opposition quick enough . we don't move the ball quick enough and we don't move off the ball quick enough . poor .
never mind the shit happening at celtic park , barcelona down 2-0 to ajax ! wtf ?!
football fact : most milan fans on twitter are tossers .
 ur so stupid and useless
arsenal win . barca overs . neapoli v dortmund to goals . milan win . lol i'm sorry i should have tweeted this before üòÖüòÇüòÖ
kaka in a milan shirt on a european night ! some things should never change <3 :)
ooh , kaka playing for ac milan against celtic
cause you support celtic doesn't mean your irish 
only an hour left of classes and then thanksgiving break ! imma head straight home and watch some celtic thunder dvd's!!
c'mon celtic !!
milan have been excellent going forward . their movement off the ball is absolutely fantastic .
celtic are gang 
mums annoying me sa i told her that i hope celtic lose tonight n she legit hates meh üòÇüòÇüòÇ
 stone cold , milan lucic , chuck bednarik ( at age 88) , van damme , pat ' the bat ' burrell

just seen the goal celtic conceded hahahaha
kaka awesome header goal ac milan 1- celtic 0 half time
catch the second half of this match , come on celtic !!
feel i going and watch ac milan match ...
lol wtf since when does kaka play for ac milan
celtic look vulnerable to the counter-attack . james forrest in particular has looked very exposed at times .
how about a wee banter banner at the next home game ? king billy's horse trodding on some celtic fans ? well they can have sands and gun ones ?
could be curtains :( 
impressive stuff from kaka so far in the celtic game
great to see winning ! hope they go through instead of milan .
2 goals for celtic & barca in 2nd half ? please god !
( grupo h - parcial ) 1)- barcelona 10 pts 2)- 8 pts 3)- ajax 7 pts 4)- celtic 3 pts ( ht ) 0-1 ( kaka 13 )

samaras on the left , derk on the right and bring on a striker .... stokes , pukki , balde , larsson , pierre .... even fucking gerry creaney 
terrible defending from celtic and to make the night even worse those bastards are beating barca 2-0
moron gray was talking about dortmund penalty . so now juve is responsible for incompetent refs . and celtic are angels .
its a disgrace at how we've just folded over in the first 4.5 games . let's fucking raise it celtic
meanwhile , ajax lead fc barcelona 2-0 . problem is , celtic 0-1 ac milan . so celtic needs to make themselves useful for a change and score .
watching ac and celtic game go ac ac 1-0 celtic
careful now celtic shooting or getting the ball into the box might result in a goal .
i wish the green brigade would learn to spell before putting up protest banners 90% of celtic fans couldn't give a fuck about !
13 ' kaka scored , ht milan 1 - 0 celtic 
i don't no why they give celtic a champion league spot it should be for a 5th english club
kak√°'s last cl goal for ac milan had dated back to 6 november 2007 . his 29 career cl goals extend record by a brazilian in .
celtic out anyway fuck sake
favorite teams- barcelona , psg , man u , milan , bayern m . i can probably name every player lol
milan go go go ..
i need to get milan's new kit
haven't seen celtic this outmatched since the scottish league cup .
can tell he really cares after milan's recent struggles
come on the hoops ! milan are here for the taking !! hail ! hail !
( grupo h - parcial ) 1)- barcelona 10 pts 2)- 8 pts 3)- ajax 7 pts 4)- celtic 3 pts
milan's last win in scotland dates back to 1969 , when they won 1-0 at celtic . they have picked up two draws and two losses in scotland since
milan with 3 defensive mids vs commons in the hole . get a 2 striker attacking derks baws in . time for balde to make a name .
ay celtic don't leave me owing addean two rounds man please
want to go to sleep so iam watching celtic milan game
arsenal playing behind closed doors or is the emirates sound proof ? where r the fans ? celtic park on the other hand is pumping 
can someone tell me as soon as the celtic match is back on ?
45 minutes for celtic to save their european season . europa league is even looking distant now .
halftime !! good game ! grande ricky and bonera the rock in the center of the defense . 
4-2-3-1 formation not working for celtic . forrest ( vs emanuelson ) poor on the right . pukki or stokes for forrest and go to 4-3-3 an option ?
milan are average at best but celtic aren't even at that level , piss poor so far !
relax celtic fans , i had the wrong home top on , last seasons is the lucky one ! 2nd half should be a doddle ! 
just a shite greenock morton . 
a child i babysit just invited me to a celtic festival . 8 is a bit young for me .
not even surprised by the result so far . it seems we can only win spl matches which doesn't say much . 
celtic need to pull their finger out their pudda in the second half
it's a long way back for celtic now , in both their own game and because of what is happening in amsterdam . a miracle is needed 
ive watched this team every game this season and weve rarely hit the heights ... couldnt understand all the hype about beating milan tonight .
milan are fucking shite
the best that can be said about celtic so far this evening is that they are ordinary . say bye-bye to european football for another season .
change of plan this weekend , now covering v on sunday , should be a belter ! seeing both sides of the old firm this weekend ...
you¬¥ll never walk alone 
 , we trust in u milan <3333
celtic have lost 10 of their 22 european games against italian sides ( w5 d7) . 
shite session but oh well c'mon celtic , take our chancesüçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄ
ac milan have not won in scotland on their last 4 visits . record in scotland is w2 d2 l3 .
prediction time . arsenal 3-0 , chelsea 2-0 and milan 2-0 .
great 1st half from .
final ht thought . as well as guile and creativity , tonight we also lack belief . not out of though so big 45mins ahead . come on celtic .
how bout all milan players get injected with ricky's enthusiasm ? it'l be incredible !
every trip back to milan reminds me 1 . how much i need portkeys to be real and 2 . that i left all the harry potter's at school .
c'mon milan show the scum who's boss . 
dont know when celtic are gonna learn that mulgrew is lost in the midfield ! ma sister could do a job against st. mirren , thistle etc
happy for dortmund , ac milan , and arsenal .. sorry barca but you need messi
empty stands at that porto game . shocking . at least celtic park is always packed , no matter what .
celtic-milan 0-1 ( y )
assembly today , milan is winning and practice tonight decent day
celtic just lacked the extra bit of quality and discipline this whole campaign . fingers crossed we can come back . tight budget don't help !
wonder what odds a barca celtic double would b now ! üí∑
45 minutes to save our european campaign .. come on celtic üôèüçÄ
i was too busy ... tot we were playing celtic .... lol .. see my life ... i want my life back mehn ...

alerte you ll neverwalk alone at celtic park 
what crap marking from celtic that was for kaka's goal he didn't even move just stood there & headed it in no challenge at all
dear milan , here is a free goal . would you like us to giftwrap it for you ? love celtic
need celtic to win tonight 
and yet i know plenty celtic fans that do just support their side . they must feel very let down by this " brigade ".
kaka class is permanent ... phd @ the university of milan
honestly celtic need to get the finger out and sign a decent striker in january , since hooper left we are very poor up front
celtic to draw - why not ? 
3 more sitters missed . such a disappointing euro campaign this year 
barca wake the fck up please . milan's trying to get into the knockout round
celtic fans are amazing
celtic are not cl material . the only reason they qualify every year's because the spl is about as competitive as the airtricity league .
i knew ac milan would be winning right now & kaka would score :)
lol at celtic with their bobby sands flag . words cannot express how much i pity i have those confused tobies .
wtf barcelona get your shit together , help out celtic you dummies , lost without messi
front 3 for milan is their forte . early goal we'll be fine . ajax will not beat barca .
i get so frustrated watching celtic in the champions league
you ' ll never walk alone , celtic .

 milan 1-0 celtic
class , pace , tenacity , excitement , a few things you can be sure to see in any celtic game . 
wee bit of passion please celtic no much to ask for
1st half results : chelsea 0-0 , kaka scored for milan , bvb scored a penalty and arsenal finished their 1st half with a goal 
people only think celtic park has a good atmosphere because its loud , when it's actually just full of angry scotsmen shouting complete shit .
cmon celtic !!!! yous can fucking do this
so many good games , idk which to watch bar√ßa vs ajax , celtic vs ac milan , chelsea vs basel , arsenal vs marseille !?!? <3
this commentator is really retarded , he is saying that milan are playing their match of the season .
james forrest ( celtic ) arressted on alleged sexual assault , that's the last time he gets to coach the under13s
mon celtic an early goal get celtic park rocking . got to go for it lenny
ajax 2-0 up , celtic 1-0 down !?!? this is turning out ta be a fkn nightmare üò´üò°
old school from jeff stelling on sky , saying celtic will not even make it to the ' uefa cup ' if it stays this well .
love the fact i stay next to celtic park when you'll never walk alone plays üëå
you'll never walk alone au celtic park au retour des joueurs ! ‚öΩÔ∏èüçª‚ù§Ô∏è

celtic celtic that's the team for me . cmon bhoys get in to them . . 
2nd half is underway !!! forza milan !!!
celtic defence playing statues at kaka's goal . zonal statues .
 last win in scotland dates back to 1969 when they won 1-0 at . they have picked up two draws and two losses in scotland since
kaka & ac milan will love playing messiless barca

nicole's dial was splattered across the screens in celtic park because its her birthday üòÇ poor lassie
barca give a change to the ajax , and ajax accepted . so ... milan be careful ;)
mon celticüòû
what a massive half of football for ajax . outplaying barca at home ! if they can keep going the milan game at the san siro will be a thriller
how goodness heightens beauty ! - milan kundera
hope barca isn't trying to make life difficult for milan by losing ' mysteriously ' to ajax & covering with the ' without messi ' story ?
 we can do this . 
c'mon celtic !
without kaka milan would be fucked all 
mon celtic , not over yet !
come on celtic we deserve a goal
do you think we can win this in the 2nd half ?????? 
because we only know that there's going to be a show , and the glasgow celtic will be there !!! time to win this game !
anyone tell me how many corners did celtic earn ? 1-2 ?
we're back underway in glasgow , celtic need more of a cutting edge this half if they're to turn this around‚Ä¶ 
ht . celtic - milan 0-1 . 
good to see celtic giving away early christmas presents at parkhead tonight and like a true gentleman kaka accepts it cheer up neil üò°
kaka was playing for milan , came to real madrid to earn some money and went back . ofc that he looks ok in milan in crisis ffs . 05 haha
watching celtic second half
which of these borderline cl teams am i supposed to care about ? napoli ? celtic , i guess ?
everyone stop watching the ac milan/celtic game and go home so i can go home .
that was as poor a goal ive seen celtic concede home or away in the cl , need to do it the hard way
still in shock over how bad celtic's defending was for milan's goal they need a huge second half 
what's the celtic score ??
i lowkey want ajax to win i don't ac milan to padd
 trail 1-0 to at the start of the 2nd half . 
canna stand the arabs/huns when celtic play ... speak utter shite lookin for a bite
no matter what happens always be celtic through and through
came home from work to see celtic losing and ajax beating barcelona ?? the fuck !! get yerselves together celtic !! attack attack attack !! ‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è
come on celtic get a draw out of this one ! good to see a player like kaka still has it , class act
kaka really is milan's whole team
not one thing in that gb display says anything about this game , champions league , football or celtic .
meanwhile kaka scores again for milan . kudos for him .
celtic have 45 mins to rescue their campaign here ... big performance needed now ! 
big half for celtic ! c'mon bhoys !!!!
why do the gb get away with thinking they speak for all celtic fans ?
this is not ac milan ! this is ac kaka :d
celtic need to keep the ball and do more with it in the final third of the park , james forrest n commons need involved . 
close free-kick celtic ! c'mon
apart from commons ' first 6 months at celtic , he's completely overrated , too slow , too fat and not interested when it counts 
let's go milan you got this üôåüî¥‚ö´Ô∏èüëä
what a player lustig has been for celtic !
free kick for celtic
come on celtic !!!!!!!
go go go .. 3poin beserta milan
free kick .... come on . 
if ajax win tonight does that mean celtic can't qualify no matter what the celtic score is ?
oh wow celtic could get this , oh wait nakamura is like 50
what was that song playing at celtic park ?........
not a lot of goalmouth action , but were largely in control and deserved their lead even if the defending was poor . 
alot of celtic fans complaining about a banner and a journalist covering the game . aye that's the problem ! he shouldve been marking kaka
celtic 0 ac milan 1 
prove me wrong celtic .
come on celtic . 
playing in the champions league but it's all about bobby sands and william wallace , can't think of anything worse than some celtic fans .
and we are off ! 0-1 milan ... fk celtic 20 yards out ... left hand side of box ... mulrgew area ..
barca should win so milan could have a better chance of qualifying ! 
come on celtic , massive effort !
ac milan have been crap this season celtic could and should win this come on !!!
celtic drew with ajax but ajax are beating barcelona 
celtic need a striker , like a proper one , not someone like pukkiüòï
right ... come on celtic .
gonnae be controversial and unbiggoted and say cummon scotland/celtic 
that atmosphere in celtic park is different class
oh celtic are playing in the champions league , better support them now 
just get the feeling celtic will get back into this . 
come on celtic and barca ...... prove me wrong .
celtic bout to destroy milan this half
celtic !!! ah , you all thought
ahh well ... if this is to be our last half in europe this season , let's make it one to be proud of ! cmon celtic 
what was doing in ? can anyone please answer this question for me ? 
i'm gonna jizz if celtic even get a goal .
would love celtic to pull this back üçÄ
c'mon celtic
parkhead looking absolutely perfect at the start of the 2nd half . i miss glasgow and scotland . go 
milan's last win in scotland dates back to 1969 , when they won 1-0 at celtic . they have picked up two draws and two losses in scotland since
celtic have lost 10 of their 22 european games against italian sides ( w5 d7) . 
come on celtic !
celtic are so shit üòÇ .
hope celtic win this but kaka is still quality

celtic are fucked gdbye champions league nd probably also europa
would love to take this free kick 
kickoff babak2 : celtic 0-1 ac milan 45
put one in the box ! don't shoot ! 
if only celtic had nakumura for the free kicks
we're down but not out . let's do this celtic .
dangerous looking free-kick early in the 2nd half here for celtic , looks like mulgrew to strike it 
gotta love tanner rhyming off milan's stats of late , reminding us how " shite " they are . fud
this is probably one of the worst milan sides i have seen
" sometimes our path is difficult ... because the ending is worth it ! ‚Äù ‚Äï milan ljubincic 
free kick to celtic from close range
oh i hope milan score the second goal after wasting most of andy's bet money on it üôà
has broken celtic's record transfer fee , having paid ¬£7m to sign charlie austin . 13
barca 2 down , porto losing at home to wien and even milan are winning , crazy times ‚öΩ
freekick buat celtic
wow how did celtic not score
napoli need a draw now to qualify . milan need to win and ajax to lose to qualify . juve need to win their next 2 to qualify . 
demanding politics are left out of football is one of silliest comments you could make . celtic‚Äôs existence is a political statement .

what a second ball there from charlie mulgrew ... shame yer man on the end of it was shite 
wow . how do you miss a chance like that 
abbiati saves milan from a close range shot that should have gone in .
if u missed that chance playing for knocka celtic you'd be taken off and shot and rightly so 
feel so sorry for celtic , such an unlucky team
watchin celtic v milan :)
literally any where else and that was in . celtic are hunting for a goal
super save from abbiati ! the defense should have done a lot more better than that . celtic 0 vs ac milan 1
i have never seen an easier chance celtic uh oh ! come on though celtic !
terrible goal for celtic to give up but decent response . expect us to go on and still lose 2-0
how have celtic missed that
milan defending pathetic as usual
how did the celtic fella just miss ?
celtic have lost 10 of their 22 european games against italian sides ( w5 d7) . 
how aren't celtic level : 0 so much chances !
arsenal , chelsea , porto to win , celtic to draw . that's my money where my mouth is .
pukki would have scored 
whatever happens in the second half celtic have had some great chances to score ! c'mon the bhoys in green !!!!
this game is so shit might have to watch celtic v barca
got a soft spot for celtic as grandad was a paddy and supported them üçÄ

that was celtic's big chance to get back into the game , will be hard now
celtic just missed a sitter
 1 up 1 up 
celtic why ?
celtic fans with the banners tonight cutting no corners , they've even gone to the trouble of smelling like shite . 8-0
celtic missing ridiculous chances again !!
you can't miss they kind of chances in these kind of game . c'mon celtic .
i much prefer watching celtic play rather than arsenal and chelsea .. 
what's going on here 2-0 to ajax far play sets up a nice last game when they meet milan on 6
massive chance missed by virgil van dijk for celtic ... fired a volley straight at the keeper in acres of space about 5 yards from goal . wow .
celtic just cant put it in the net
it seems like , barca lose and that's not a big problem . the real loser is milan .
how did he miss ? 
celtic really should have drawn level there . piss poor .
u cant afford to miss that when playing against milan 
how many chances celtic ? how fucking many ?!
how are celtic not winning
celtic should be ahead here . wasting chances !
celtic have missed some absolute sitters tonight 
ac milan lives lol did he want a better shot ?
celtic unlucky .. should have equalized against ac milan ..
come on celtic
49 milan make their first change as abate is replaced by nocerino .
from cafu stam nesta n maldini to this garbage at the back . what's happened to milan ?
haha celtic are so poor
mulgrew shoots into the wall , but van dijk has a volley which is saved at point blank range ... best chance so far for celtic 
 maybe final if we're lucky . to the semi's , and maybe too . that would be perfect , and in 3-4 years , get us 4th back .
what a miss ! celtic with an incredible chance but missed by van dijk .
how did celtic not score then
nocerino is on ! 
love watching celtic
what a pass from mulgrew over to van dijk 
that right there is an indication of how fucking rotten milan are at the back . they're one of the worst defences i've seen at celtic park !
got to laugh to these celtic fans who think there irish and there apart of the ira 
lets go milan ! 
damn come on let's get a goal here we need to keep celtic in the champions league
how did he miss that btw i'm watching celtic milan
milan don't show my dude nocerino enough love doe .
ajax vs milan winner takes it all it's looking like
 corner milan
may go back to the ac milan game , at least celtic are putting up a fight
celtic and ac milan game is rather entertaining
dae celtic hink they can take this piss tae it's ripped right oot ae us ? cause a think that's wit they're dain
lustig is having another outstanding game for celtic
in fairness he caught that to well . unlucky van dijk 
bt are welcome to the champions league actually . pointless and dull until the quarter finals . best thing about the group stage is celtic .
abbiati can't believe his luck there , how have celtic not scored there ?
the football gods are not smiling on the celtic fc
van dijk misses an absolute sitter for celtic .. fuck me , even bendtner would have scored that .

terrible defending by celtic

zapata loves scoring against celtic
fuckin shocking defending from celtic !
harsh realities for celtic . van dijk misses a glorious chance and now it's 2-0 . same for ajax too , down to 10 men and barca score a penalty .

abiatti with the nutty save and zapata wit the goal 2-0 
two absolute gifts to milan what a fucking travesty this management and team are
another corner .... undefended at the back post .... passed back across the six-yard box and tapped in from 2 yards ... zapata .. 2-0 milan
some horrific defending from celtic here .
what a terrible 2nd goal for celtic to concede
should be 1-1 but celtic now 2-0 down
fucking celtic are pure scutter . the entire defence occupy the 6 yard zone during corners . 
dad walked in and he recognised milan by they're kit and i got really proud coz i've been teaching him . then he goes they're from spain init
celtic clearly learnt from there first goal
but constant . celtic 0 - milan 2
zapata 2 goals in the champions league both against celtic 
goal raddoppio , goal . 0-2 
fook sake celtic . this is probably the worst milan team in history .
and zapata scored for milan , 2-0 now in glasgow
celtic could've been winning if they had taken their chances
fuck sake celtic two corners conceded why did they not stop zonal marking after the first
why did i bother with this celtic game ?
zonal marking working a treat for celtic tonight
2 corners . really really poor from celtic and we deserve nothing more .
celtic using the man-marking methods from milan's playbook again !
celtic's defence at corners is appalling .
celtic defending like something from the west cork leauge old days

celtic game is over maybe next year
never seen celtic play this bad at home in the champions league with so much at stake 
milan outscoring a team off a set piece ... the city of milan should rush to their nearest lottery booth for tickets asap
zapata ! 0-2 to milan . tap in at the back post just a minute after van dijk missed a sitter . hopefully that's the job done now . 
celtic fucked , game over !
hahaha celtic's defending awful ! delightful viewing
celtic are so frustrating to watch man
the unfortunate thing is this proves that ac milan are officially better than us . gutted .

some very poor defending by celtic tonight
not much better than a pub team and letting ac milan score from corners
we are ac milan
you don't deserve to be anywhere near the cl if you defend set pieces like celtic have tonight .
this just in - hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ! here we go again ! shite in europe again ! 
milan would score wouldn't they
don't care what any celtic fan says the goals they gave away just shows how bad our players are in europe miles behind simple as
48 ' cristian zapata goal !! 0-2 for milan 
couldn't have been an easier shot to score from can dijk now poor defense from celtic and they score fuck sake
oh the celtic are shiiiiiiiiiite oh the celtic are shiiiiiiiite
so milan scored both goals from corners
pique needs to retire to just taking care of milan .
at least celtic are good at defending set pieces 
dear oh dear 
dreadful in so many ways tonight . very flat performance . not the usual belief in our play .
& milan go straight up the other end & double their lead . zapata with a tap in
gaaal del milan . 2 a 0 .
literally just said to myself " this is a goal " as soon as milan took that corner . awful .
celtic coach mad af üòÇüòÇüòÇ
piss poor defending from celtic , wow .
milan 2 up
ac milan 2-0 celtic
boommmm crasshhhhh wallop !!! celtic come back to earth !!!
zapata 2-0 , second goal against celtic this season ! 
after celtic missing a sitter it is game over , zapata from inches out taps in from a corner , no marking , again
absolute shocking defending from celtic 
2-0 milan .. zonal marking's fault apparently . not the fault of the inept defenders .
can't remember the last time milan scored two goals in one game from a corner .
i have 2-1 , 3-0 and 3-1 milan , c , mon !
why celtic are still using zonal marking after the first goal i'll never know
zapata the celtic killer !!!!!!
if van dijk had volleyed that ball either side then it would be 1-1 now it's fucking 2-0 to ac milan are you fucking joking me !?!?!?!?!?!?!?
awful defending , again from a set piece . 
that's a killer blow for celtic ! üò≥
just waiting on chelsea for the coupon .. forza milan
why are these commentators stroking celtic bro . that's why canadians are so shit .
celtic punished for their poor finishing !
but zapata ! 0-2 but xavi ! 2-1 ! 
celtic have literally forgot how to defend
awful marking from celtic on two milan corners . huge goal for milan .
celtic aren't good enough ! 
celtic out of europe now .
zonal marking is a bad thing at the best of times , but celtic are extra horrific at it 
good grief , that was pathetic set-piece defending from celtic .
milan flucking their way to another victory 
that's sadly good night for celtic's european campaign , not just champions league , over . unless barcelona turn around their match
what the fuck celtic seriously . attack the ball you fucking idiots
xavi makes the pk just as milan makes it 2-0 .
haha fuck celtic
cp really need to copy celtic when defending corners ....
the amount of cunts who fancied celtic tonight was stupid . milan are poor right now but no as poor as that mob
goal goal goal milan
ha celtic are shit cunts
that's terrible defending like from celtic 
come on celtic !
looks like the celtic bandwagon is gone for another year ..
well that's that then . 
celtic acting the prick 
fuck , no . come on celtic . üòí
what the fck celtic !
absolutely mingin ' celtic
goal ! milan push up the other end , and celtic are punished from the corner by zapata , who has a tap in at the far post .... 0-2 
wains could mark better than celtic in all fairness
and milan double their lead to 2-0 at celtic
just heard a massive " fuck sake " from the mother , milan must've scored again 
say bye bye celtic to champions league ! üëãüëãüëã
wow for fuck sake , this is really really slack , this milan team are poor
is this celtic or killie ? 
can you hear the celtic sing no no
ouch . hard to take for celtic , they'd been playing well . but that's why you don't mark zones .
haha get in milan . hope all you dick heads that jump on the celtic bandwagon fucking quiet down now
horrible defending again . milan two chances ... two goals and there in lies the difference between the two sides !! 
found the team worse on set pieces than milan .
kaka scores for milan !! just a glimpse of his older days ? eto injured torres comes on .. nw we can expect a clean sheet fr bsl .. lol !!
celtic are an overrated pub team
celtic thought it would be a good idea to have a nap in the six yard box ...
celtic are the most frustrating team ever üôà
missed a fucking gift and then defence a fucking disgrace at the other end . typical celtic
might as well have cones at corners 
celtic just can't defend corners ... ridiculous
celtic making looks shit lol
milan 2-0 contrary to doubters earlier today
celtic have just proven tonight that zonal marking at set pieces doesnt work !
fucking hell celtic !!!!!!!!!
zonal marking can go eat horse shite ! absolute embarrassing defending from celtic !
forster at fault for the concession of the corner , 7 standing watching the ball , more zonal bs from celtic , same result
celtic getting what they deserve here , terrible . every player standing still in box . hopeless .
celtic are the embarrassing at set pieces !!! 
goal from nothing , usual celtic defending !!
milan are knobs !: -(
celtic have looked terrible off of corners , man marking completely off
just new that ac milan would score again after that miss from van dyke
haha ! celtic ... goodbye
not good enough from celtic . simply not good enough against a very poor milan team 
celtic's defence from set pieces is awful .
absolutely fucking pish , weakest milan side in years and you still can't beat them . we're shite
celtic are timbits league at this point
 defending at set pieces is woeful !!

celtic are alright at zonal marking

i'm done watching celtic ... horrible defensive performance , once again ! shite .
zonal marking ... brilliant idea celtic
ac milan now lead 2-0
the two milan goals were celtic defending like 
celtic had a great chance to make it 1-1 , 5 minutes later milan score haha
celtic 0-2 ac milan zapata 49 mins from another corner
this zonal marking is really working for celtic , great management call that one
is there any point in carrying on with the champions league now that the biggest team in it are 2-0 down and heading out ? 
and hopefully that secures the win . zapata of all people as well . 
focus . 
so celtic cant defend set pieces
fuck off celtic you septic cunts

and milan score too !!
van dijk should have scored and now milan go up the other end and score missed opportunity
we on fire forza milan
haha bye celtic . neil lennon deserves everything that's coming at him . tactically inept 
utter pish , milan can't believe their luck .

zapata puts milan 2-0 up at celtic .
celtic miss a sitter then milan make it 2-0 from a corner . love it
hate zonal marking 
absolutely gutted . both coupons pumped and celtic are getting a doin :( !
barca losing 2-0 to ajax . celtic losing to milan 0-1 . reasonably happy :)
celtic don't deserve to be 2 nil down but you can't defend set pieces that poorly at this level 
why are celtic so good at marking ?
amazing set piece by milan . 2 goals by corner kick :d
milan better fucking score again i said 2-0 and couldn't be arsed putting a bet on it
3-2 will do rightly 
get in there milan !
again ????????? if you don't learn from your mistakes you will constantly get punished ! üò° 
celtic pay the price for not taking their chances . easy tap in for zapata . more poor defending from celtic
milan 2-0 celtic !
zonal marking is the biggest load of shite . i don't think i've ever seen it work . ever ! 
two absolutely criminal goals to lose from a celtic point of view . horrendous .
celtic's defence providing all the lolz tonight
kelty is better at defending set pieces than celtic
get zonal marking to fuck ! never learn ! lennon must take full responsibility for this shambles !

celtic are completely throwing away this game üòë
shocking celtic . piss poor
r . i . p celtic you will be remembered as the team of the uk when all the bpl clubs get knocked out
holy crap , celtic has gone to sleep in defending . now down 2 to milan
celtic doing wonders against 13th placed ac milan
totally pathetic from celtic tonight the marking at corners has been ridiculous !!! 
so hold up milan 2-0 , barca losing 2-1 and atletico madrid score .... chelsea need a goal .
celtic are the football equivalent of those filthy console peasants
celtic glasgow-milan ac 0-(2 ) but de cristian zapata ( 49 ' ) 
awwww celtic are so frustrating at times
shocking miss from celtic , then shocking defensive mistake at the other end , not good enough
didn't zapata score last time against celtic as well ? lololololol
kmt celtic deserve to loose they are very wasteful with their chances

horrible defending from celtic from set pieces tonight has cost them .. woeful 
celtic showing why zonal marking will never ever work .
celtic miss an open goal and within a minute concede a mighty unlucky goal .

celtic last full house for at least a year and a half if they don't qualify next year , shame . anyway moan chesterfield gees a goal
some excellent defending from corners by celtic tonight !
zonal marking is shite !!! 
celtic marking on corners is so disappointing ! second goal from nothing conceded ..
for fucks sake celtic
celtic fans will want to make the most of that trip to barcelona because apart from that they won't be going anywhere else in europe
ac milan are possibly the shittest team , don't deserve this lead at all ..
celtic's defending from corners is worse than newcastle's offense from corners ...
28/1 aswell for milan 3-0 . 
whole group has turned on his head . inexperience eh , long half ahead for ajax . milan 2 up v celtic too .
celtic that was shocking .... 
commentator described that well " touched in " totally unmarked , get a grip celtic !!!
christian zapata has doubled milan's lead over celtic 2-0
zapata scores a second for milan at parkhead and again the celtic defence were caught napping . celtic 0 ac milan 2 ( 50 mins) .
thats that then ... abysmal marking celtic
goal !!! ac milan
zapata does something useful in these 2 years and scores the second goal . milan leads 2-0 now
that was a gift for us there ...... fuck me i cuda finished that ... cmon celtic . 
ah ffs . another great start blown away by stupid , stupid defending !! 2-0 milan . another corner and invisible marking .

zonal marking hasn't done celtic any favours tonight , i don't understand why you don't just mark a man 
holy shit ... that's really poor defending from celtic . twice .
celtic only raise their game for aberdeen .
celtic have hired statues for defenders shocking

celtic caught playing musical statues again and 2 mins after they should have been 1-1 they find themselves 0-2
oh celtic
that last minute sums football up .... celtic miss absolute sitter then concede within a minute !! 
i've seen more movement in a game of musical statues than the celtic defence tonight 
heart broken . celtic why do you do this to me ?
milan have got this zonal marking carry on down to a fucking tee . ripped us open twice from it ! 
fs celtic
lool celtic should just leave this zonal marking man
golazo from glasgow , celtic 0 milan 2 
another milan corner another soft goal no one on the post 2-0 milan goodnight celtic 
 celtic 0 ac milan 2 ( zapatta 50 ); ajax 2 barcelona 1 ( xavi pen 49 ) and veltman sent off for ajax .
 0 2 after 50 mins = game over ... channel-hops to 1 0 instead ...
milan , meanwhile , have doubled their lead over celtic to 2-0 on the zapata goal .
barca back in it 2-1 and ac 2-0 up now against celtic
game over ! european football over !! poor , very poor from celtic !! saaaake lads !! turn it around will ya's! fucking set play goals
once again that was some of the most embarrassing defending you'll see from celtic at a set piece . 0-2 to milan now . celtic out .
when did celtic zonal mark ? its fucking horrific
i would have said celtic's best bet of scoring goals before the game were from set pieces instead they've cost us 2
goals ! zapata scores for ac milan right as xavi scores for barcelona . 2:0 in scotland , and 1:2 in amsterdam the scores respectively . 
wouldn't mind celtic defending like this on sunday . they are pathetic at the back . out of the champions league you go üëãüëãüëã
zapata with his first cl goal . 2-0
can't remember the last time milan scored two goals in one game from a corner .
shambolic defending again from celtic . hope some of the support will start to realise just how inept lennon is now .
ac milan is really impressing tonight
2 goals where everyone in the box just stood back and let milan have a free shot at goal from inside the 6 yard box .
utter pish celtic on every level .
celtic are great at just giving away goals
fuck off celtic shite marking again ! don't mind losing but school boy errors at this level ! sort it fucking out ...
celtic couldn't mark my 7 year olds homework ! embarrassing
it's all over for celtic now , milan 2-0
horrid defending from celtic but i'll take that .
ffs , all over for another smelly year ! celtic bye bye
the bad thing is this is a very poor milan side
zapata scores to make it 2-0 ac milan vs celtic 
shocking finishing and even worse defending from celtic tonight
celtic could easily be winning this if they took their chances right
much rather rangers than celtic . celtic are so overrated as club , ridiculous
aye gid at defending this celtic team hahahaha
excellent stuff . at least celtic are getting a tonking !
2-0 ac milan yass take that ya shity celtic pricks
celtic don't deserve to be getting beat 2-0
then again , celtic don't seem to understand the concept of defending in general .
get the finger out celtic !
shocking defending from celtic for both milan goals ! stottish teams are shit
no biting of nails ... 2 nil down .... 
2-0 milan , zapata . thats it now .
shocking defending from celtic ..
celtic's zonal marking is really an issue here , twice they've had breakdowns leading to goals .
celtic are very hard to watch !
fuck sake celtic this is terrible , they are walking them in now
fucksake celtic
heartbreaking supporting celtic sometimes . gifted them 2 shit goals and missed some sitters . not our night .
celtic ain't gonna even get europa league üòê
lesson learned celtic , don't use zonal marking ! because use are shite at it !!
poor marking from celtic
hey , milan ... want to lend us a goal ?
haha comical stuff from celtic .
what a shite celtic team this is üòÇüòÇ
what a wee shame on celtic btw
well , on the bright side , if ac milan go through to the round of 16 , manchester city will have another easy team they could possibly playüòÇ
ac milan can't beat a team in serie a , but celtic just gives it to them
zapata scores . his second against celtic this season . the bhoys ' set piece defence is as good as ours ! 
for fuck sake celtic man mark . it's painful trying to watch you zonal mark
utter pish celtic
as zapata makes fun of celtic :-)
great defending celtic ! it's not just a striker they need 
goals galore !! ac milan ( zapata ) have a 2-0 lead over celtic whilst barcelona get one back v 10-men ajax ( xavi pen) . 
spl defending have cost celtic here , cant fault commitment & effort but them goals are schoolboy
if celtic could keep up this kind of defending for sunday i'll be very happy !
a don't often give celtic stick but fucking hell that is disgraceful defending ! am fucking furious !
goal ! celtic 0-2 ac milan ( cristian zapata , 49 ' ) 
i'm going to retweet my own tweet to highlight celtic's ability - of you can call it that - at defending corner kicks . 
celtic better start waking the fuck up 
that's gordon strachan celtic defending ffs
embarrassing defending yet again , celtic . party over .
goal ! celtic 0-2 ac milan ( cristian zapata , 49 ' ) 
2 easy ac milan
someone needs to explain to the co-commentator on the celtic game that zonal marking doesn't mean the players aren't allowed to move
sickened being two down when they should be level .. 
goal ! celtic 0-2 ac milan* . cristian zapata the scorer .
2-0 shocking defending from celtic !
milan were 6/4 . why'd a only put a tenner on it !! 
goal ! celtic 0-2 ac milan ( cristian zapata , 49 ' ) 
i can't see how teams in the spl can't punish teams like celtic week in week out , they are horrendous at defending
this is fucking poor celtic .
what a pleasure it will be to have those fun loving celtic supporters at tynecastle on sunday ...
milan 2-0 up but barca are 2-0 down we need to win tonight and ajax in few weeks like defo ! 
same shite different day from celtic . ditch this zonal marking and buy a fucking decent centre forward !!
and after that missed chance milan score through zapata . goal ! 2-0 ac milan . celtic dead and buried in this match now .
en 2-0 milan me like too
50 ' celtic 0 - 2 ac milan
game over 
2-0 milan , looks like it's over for celtic
corner celtic , we need 3 goals ...
what a chance for van dijk and didn't take it . then to make it worse they're 2-0 down now think that's it for celtic
some amount of sellick fans with " love celtic , hate bigotry " in their bio . he who doth protest too much ......
that's madness , 2 corners ... schoolboy celtic
plenty of time yet but in fairness we are poor 
did celtic not learn from first goal# zonal markingpish
two really poor goals to concede from celtic's point of view , both from corners , showing zonal marking doesn't work .
this game is being decided by one team being slightly worse at defending corners than the other . awful again from 
it's almost as if people think barca , ajax and milan are mediocre teams ...
what are at here , shocking defending . probably the worst ac milan team ever winning 2-0
fucckkkk sake zonal marking again ! so annoying milan are actually shit
think that could be game over celtic
because zonal marking worked so well in the first half , let's do it again for the second ... 
do celtic do zonal in their league
i'm going out to milan for this break . gotta get away from this ...
celtic's defending from set plays is awful
& zapata for milan ! üòõ
this is like watchin killie ! 
shite man !! milan r reactin to everything and celtic urny pishhh
 ggggoooollll dddeeeelll milaaaannnn : zzzzaaapppaaatttaaa , 2-0 !!!'
milan is winning to ‚ö´üî¥‚ö´üî¥
you would have thought celtic would have learned there lesson from defending zonal
zapata scores the second for ac milan
knew milan were gonna beat celtic .
celtic are rubbish
a big save by milan keeper abiatti and then milan goes the other way to make it 2-0
celtic fans will be really aeneid at that miss by virgil and then to concede a second
goaaallllll c . zapata !!! celtic vs milan 0-2 
" amsterdam arena , celtic park , signal iduna park " these names give me mouth orgasm
game over celtic .
typical celtic , game not over but they're gonna need something special
as doddsy and i always agreed - generally zonal marking is a bummer ! celtic 0 milan 2

had celtic on to draw inal
ma team are better at defending corners than celtic lol
well done celtic , well done
i feared for celtic tonight despite the golden chances they have missed a goal would be nice
absolute joke celtic
celtic should have equalised . two minutes later it's game over . terrible . 
now that miss from van dijk looks a whole lot worse , what can celtic do to come back‚Ä¶ thoughts ?? 
fuck sake celtic !!! get your fecking asses into gear !! need a bloody rocket up your rear ends !!
it's a one sided pounding and ac milan are swinging the hammer
unlucky celtic missed a great chance to score and milan go up the other end and score
zonal marking is an absolute dog shit tactic and celtic have paid the price twice üôà
celtic are like pins waiting to be knocked down in that six yard box . utterly naive defending yet again . zapata takes advantage
another shocking goal ! wake up celtic !
celtic sucking on defending corners ... 2-0 milan
celtic should be winning this game
ac . milan proving to be as bad as widely expected .
celtic take the fingers out and score , fs !! hh
celtic's set-piece defense plan is very poor i must admit
my celtic bet is lost ! but my ajax vs barca is coming back in live !!! lets make a draw !
celtic fc sponsored by easyjet .. you know the rest ..
awful celtic .
2-0 milan . bye bye celtic scum
how did he miss that ... and milan score then hahaha

reading the live feed of the celtic game online is making me more nervous than i would of been watching it .
what is it with celtic and conceding a goal in europe straight after missing their best chance of the game ?
poor celtic
celtic daint deserve to go through with this awful defending
zonal marking doesn't work when your good , never mind when your celtic ffs .

celtic 0-2 ac milan . zapata with the game and it's game over for celtic 
yes !!! 2 - 0 milan just need to not lost to next round and they're through !
why celtic are using zonal marking i'll never understand . two very poor goals to concede . only got themselves to blame !
solid defending from celtic 
what a poor poor team milan are aswell , embarrassing .
celtic are absolutely shocking at dealing with set plays
two incredibly weak goals to concede for celtic . zonal marking clearly not working .
every goal celtic have conceded has been a cross or corner pish
why cant milan be like this in the serie a ?
why do teams use zonal marking , celtic have just lost 2 goals from it , am no complaining but
all he had to to was take a touch put the kettle on sweat it to the other boy to tap in 
zonal marking is for wankers 
wow , celtic really can't defend to save their lives ! they're worse than spurs at the back
how many celtic players does it take2defend a fuckin goal ?? still waiting on the answer to that fuckin joke !! useless pricks ! 
goooooaaal ! celtic glasgow vs . ac mailand . livescore 0-2 
ha celtic are fairly shit at defending
hahaha poor old fucking celtic ! that's what happens when you fuck up hahahahaha bye bye
cheerio cheerio cheeriooooo .. can you hear the celtic sing .. noo .. noooo 
watching celtic v milan with dad .... why i don't know but i am . lol .
celtic's defending at set pieces is shocking ! like mannequins in a shop window - static !
 . 2-0 . heading out . 
and then ya get punished . pathetic defending though . 
zapata scores for milan . celtic are likely to miss the knockout stages now . van dyke's chance might come back to haunt them .
2-0 milan , amateurish defining again by celtic . hopefully napoli can grab an equaliser , b4 the ref sends off 7 players just for the craic .
celtic are really good at defending corners . 
goodbye celtic .
fucking hell celtic !!!
celtic are shite
it looked like celtic were coming for an equalizer until ac milan scored the second goal
come on celtic‚öΩÔ∏è
 ( live ) : celtic glasgow [ 0 - 2 ] milan ac 51 ' 
absolute fuckin shambles . has zonal marking ever been proved effective ? never . fuckin useless celtic
that might be that for celtic ...
goooolll | celtic 0-2 ac milan ( 50 ' zapata )
not over yet but celtic really need to score soon .
gol do milan <3
goalflash : ac milan make it 2-0 against celtic with a goal from zapata .
goal ! celtic 0-2 milan - cristian zapata ! i'd say that seals it , but i've seen milan play football this season . 
zonal marking is bullshit 
disgusting set piece defending from celtic
2 goals from 2 different colombians as porto equalise and milan double their lead , xavi gets a goal back for barcelona in amsterdam .
celtic fans consoling themselves with the knowledge that italian teams are famous for throwing away leads .
since mourihno has decided to turn evry chelsea player into a defender . i think i ll b beta off watching " real football ". celtic/milan wil do
gol de milan too oh my this is great
milan on point 
celtic literally have an open goal chance , missed . milan then score .
 ( live ) : celtic glasgow [ 0 - 2 ] milan ac 51 ' 
zonal marking taking some more abuse from sky's commentators at celtic . pretty sure it's * bad * zonal marking is the problem , muppets !
celtic 0-2 ac milan 
and barcelona fans told me : it's hard to score in celtic park . kiss my ass
fuck me celtic
yesssss celtic !!! ‚öΩÔ∏è 2 more goals to go
should not of put celtic vs ac milan under 2.5 . 
celtic concede the softest goals
zonal marking .... if you don't learn from your mistakes they'll keep repeating themselves ! ‚öΩÔ∏è 
2 set pieces . 2 goals . pathetic defending celtic . join us in europa .
would be a start for the celtic defenders to wake up like ..
hahaha celtic will be back to being half empty for the rest of the season now ! 
i thought celtic could put a result on the board against a weak milan team .... but no , 0-2 for the italians !! 
typical celtic , absolute peach oh a chance .. miss and concede a minute laterüò´
goool accorcia su rigore , - 2-1 e ... ! incredibile ! - 0-2 11
 vs defense like statues for that goal ? did the music stop - i couldn't hear !
biggest myth in football is zonal marking . zones don't score goals . players score goals . it is honestly that simple . 
christian eduardo zapata ( ac milan ) scores !. 2-0 milan are on business today .
goodness me celtic's defending from set pieces may actually be worse than milan's . all too easy for a 2nd goal from a corner 
two cheap goals celtic ffs !
barca should win now , ac milan on 10 men and 2-1
fucksake celtic , miss a sitter then milan go score again . learn how to defend a corner .
i'd rather ajax hang on and take it to the wire than celtic go through . football deserves this .
how harsh is that should of scored then conceded 
i think both barca and celtic wer out on tje lash last night 
mad to think how highly kaka would have been rated if he stayed at milan
celtic's defending is awful
zonal marking does not work !! bullshit ! 
too easy for milan 
two of the worst goals you will ever see conceded at that level by celtic tonight
celtic love conceding after missing a sitter . 
the unwashed 0 - 2 ac milan . lovely
ahahahaha all that shit-talking sky did , saying this milan side were wank , and they're now 0-2 up at parkhead . love it .
come on to fuck celtic !
remembering when celtic beat barca last year and the whole of facebook becoming ' diehard ' celtic fans for the night .
celtic just not bothering with marking the corners tonight . 2-0 milan . 
milan having not won a single away game this season always means there's a chance they could collapse .
celtic break my heart !!
croly for celtic
the chances celtic miss and goals they concede in europe are horrendous .
milan and barca scored the same time . wow ! lol . tv and laptop
if ever there was an example of why not to zonal mark at corners , this is certainly it 
zonal marking isn't the problem . it's the defenders not doing their jobs ! feckin ' commentators . 2-0 down now . pish .
not even making them earn it . embarrassing . gifts . 
bon voyage celtic 
zapata goal !!! 2-0 forza milan barca(one man messi team ) lossing to ajax , loose to celtic next week , top the group
oh milan scored another ? i won't know cause my stream is still stuck in 1986
come on celtic
horrible miss by van dijk . and now are 2-0 up on 
can't believe people have backed celtic to beat ac ! üò≥
can't believe celtic havent scored atleast 2
celtic have fucked me over here
celtic displaying why zonal marking is complete nonsense . switching to 
hope for celtic now ajax are down to ten and barca convert from the spot . the smallest dribble of hope mind .
sorry celtic
ac milan have extended their lead over celtic 2-0 and it's ajax 2 barcelona 1 . 
2-0 !!!! i swear milan is a whole different team when they play in champions league !
newcastle should play celtic , might score from a corner .
and milan 2-0 up at celtic ! come on arsenal , get another one !
2-0 by celtic
milan are going to win the champions league !
well look at that . milan might just make it to the knockout round of the champions league . might be the last time you see that for awhile .
my good celtic can't defend corners . wtf is going on with frazer foster .
celtic-milan 0-2 
night night celtic
wake the fuck up celtic this is fucking poor as fuck !!!
when will celtic ever learn ? corners ... zonal marking is never working for use 
bye bye celtic
expected celtic to do better tonight
celtic's zonal marking is hilarious . what are they playing at ?
celtic absolutely dreadful in defending corners
i love how the papers were making ac milan out to be weak ... the current score contradicts that .
celtic are so crapppppppppppp . fuckers better score 2 in this half .
 milan lead 0-2 . babai celtic ?
good riddance celtic
im done i love celtic but fuck 70% of the players on our club they fuckin suck !
so far so good . good performances top to bottom . 
way out yir depth celtic ! marking is terrible !! 
abcd milan are pumping celtic like
celtic's corners are the best things ever . so bad it's funny
celtic are weak as fuck at corners
even celtic have more decent mf than manu . do something moyes , and do it quickly .
milan taking their chances albeit gifted
feel sorry for celtic like
lol celtic .
goaallll ! christian zapataa !! ' 49 ( celtic 0-2 ac milan ) 
piss fucking poor celtic piss fucking poor
go celtic
celtic's defending from corners is absolutely atrocious
celtic are so unlucky tonight
celtic pull one back . game on
on a more positive note celtic have just gone 2-0 down so ajax will at least take third spot and go into the europa league .
celtic defence is a joke !!
but milan
 - group h - match update - goal - 0 - 2 - cristian 
people saying commons doesn't belong at this level , the full team doesn't , so many chances celtic have had and can't take them
fuck sake celtic zonal marking pish fuckoff
2-0 milan let's goo 
zapata makes it 2-0 to milan ! 
celtic's defending is shitüòÇ
celtic are losing ? that's a shame , i really feel for them .
i can't wait to hear lennon blaming the rest of the scottish football fraternity for celtic's failings in europe .
whattttttt 
looks like game over for celtic 0-2
no way .. i honestly don't know what's going on . an unchallenged volley from six-yards hit straight at the keeper . now 0-2 down . 
offside goal celtic !!
goal !!! zapata !!! celtic 0 - 2 milan
game over for celtic
fuck off ac milan ! coybig
not a sign of the plastic celtic fans tonight
milan don't look like losing anymore ! lol ... hard luck celtic but it's ur own fault ! & don't forget vandyke !
celtic scores . but offside .
 gol celtic 0 - 2 milan 
celtic can't defend set pieces . get zonal marking to fuck !
i heard celtic can defend corners
this might hurt a few people but celtic are average at very best . this is the worst milan team in 2 decades .
the board will be happy with the ‚Ç¨30m pocketed and sure isn't that all that matters 
milan always do sick in the champions league but shit in the league 
2-0 milan . same mistake again . the key to zonal marking is concentration and discipline .
celtic goal ruled offside
i could actually get a group of drunken mates together to defend these 2 corners that led to milans goals better than celtic defence lol
unreal worst i have ever scene celtic from set pieces . but you must take ur chances when u get them in the champions league . 
celtic getting mugged of
celtic are so unlucky
what another cheap , disgusting goal . fucking up your game , celtic ! 
unlucky celtic !
2-0 to ac milan seconds after celtic missing a sitter . zapata scores for milan
offside for i'm loving this !
celtic jerseys are so niceüòç
hahahhaa celtic offside .
zapataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa !!!!!!!!!!! you fucking colombian !!!!!!!!!!!!!! two goals in two matches against celtic !!!!!!!!!!!!
miss of the season from celtic , annoying that it just hit the worst european goalkeeper abbiati
get in there milan fuck off celtic 
if that's what zonal marking is i think celtic need to get back to man to man . a very average milan handed 2 absolute gifts . europe over cfc
if van dijk scores that sitter of a chance celtic go 1-1 and in the driving seat , woopsies , or not !
zonal marking can get to fuck right out lennons head man !!!! one day celtic will also become clinical at finishing
curtains :-( 
celtic pls
2-0 a.c. milan . celtic couldn't mark time never mind zonal marking .
xavi pulls one back ! milan beating celtic 2-0 !
milan are 2-0 up away at celtic whilst xavi has scored a penalty for barcelona .
the two goals celtic have conceded have been from such poor defending
milan !! 
sorry , but you just canny make excuses for that . celtic 0-2 ac zonal marking ! 
hahahaha offside celtic ! fans going insane as if it wasnt lol !
who the f ... invented zonal marking ? 
celtic giving a stellar display on the effectiveness of zonal marking 
ac milan become the 3rd team in champions league history to field a starting xi without any numbers 1 - 11 .
oh dear . never mind . 
commentators might as well start singing celtic songs biast fucks
2-0 zapata scores and milan on the safe now keep pressuring them untill the final whistle on on other hand barca are 2-0 down .
come on celtic we need that goal to get us going and thank god barca 
offside goal for celtic ! so unlucky ! was offside though 
zapata is the scorer for 
milan must be sectarian 
embarrassing from celtic , shows how pish there signings
celtic goal disallowed
fuck sake !!!! fuckin nightmare celtic , never learned from the last goal , that zonal pish is not working out !!!!
get in milan !
i don't know what to make of that celtic miss . completely confused .
worst milan team in years and they're still handing celtic's arses to them .
if anyone is looking for a reason to choose man marking over zoneal marking watch the celtic game . #2howlers
2-0 to milan
celtic paid the price for that missed chance
0-2 pour le milan 
let's all laugh at celtic ! euro wannabes

tragic scenes from celtic here .
milan are winning dx
celtic are shit defending set pieces

common barcelona , you have to win this one for milan .
the atmosphere at the emirates sounds like celtic park in the 88th minute and they are drawing with peterhead in the cup on a tuesday night !
celtic are shit at defending
if we cant win at home european football is finished at celtic
lmao at celtic . milan haven't won a game in 7 and they're winning 2-0 . =p
thank you celtic for bustin me coupon .... 
zapata made it 2-0 for milan against celtic as barcelona pull one back thru xavi from the penalty spot . ajax now playing one man down
nooo celtic have a goal disallowed due to offside
celtic firmly getting their arse felt
insanity - doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . 
i may be doing a disservice , but that's more awful defending from that set-piece by , 2-0 !
celtic deserve to be pumped that defence is awful
oh dear celtic wonder if husband & son will be home early or stay till the bitter end celtic 0 ac milan 2 personally i wouldn't hang about :)
awful . no idea what's going on with the defending plus desperate for an actual striker .
goal disallowed for celtic for offside
according the the clown commentating its zonal marking that is to blame for milan's goals . not the shite defending . 
celtic fucked then .

european nights at celtic park are not european nights at anfield so there's no comeback on
zonal marking 0 - milan 2 . load of shite , milan have been useless all night , get 2 lucky goals and are gonna win . fuck sakes !
surely the zonal marking should have been ditched during the half time team talk ? 
c'mon celtic an still do this

if my tv had curtains i would pull now to stop this nightmare viewing of celtic
 have given away 2 of the cheapest , sunday league goals you'll ever see tonight .... 
milan rooting for barca ... we should just lose just for the fun of it
offside for celtic . damn what a pass though . poor timing and positioning

no one should be slagging celtic , at least they got to the champions league
50 ' cel 1 - 2 milan

weeping for celtic ..
and there's that zonal marking again ... everyone just watched the ball as it sailed over their heads . 
good grief . i feel physically wounded by the drama unfolding at celtic park tonight . 
celtic mathematically aren't out of it if they lose this :/

goal ! celtic 0-2 ac milan . minutes after missing a glorious chance , celtic go two down as zapata taps in .

haway celtic !

2 of the worst set piece goals celtic have probably ever conceded .
folk that laugh at celtic when their team is too shit to even get near to the group stages of the champions league
ajax red , milan 2 , porto one all . live live live
football can give you a kick in the teeth sometimes . caught out there when they could have been pushing for a winner now . üíîüò´
celtic out because they don't have a cutting edge need a striiker badly
quite chuffed celtic are plummeting out of europe after seeing the green brigades banners !
gutted celtic

celtic now losing 2-0
celtic handing out goals 
still plenty of time celtic but no idea where the goals will come from ... celtic have been so disappointing in europe this year
i give up like , celtic dinny take they're chances and when we do it's fucking offside
celtic were a shock last year to go through to qualification , this year its being poor
celtic games a joke !
ajax gave away a penalty in the last minute v ac milan aswell , soo stupid
ppl always blame zonal marking . but the problem is players not playing zonal correctly . both milan goals from ' zone ' with no defenders in it
zapataaaaaaaa ! celtic , to think you'll learn from that first goalüòè
half time : castlebar celtic 0 - galway 1
cheerio celtic . lol
get a quid on 3-2 celtic
thank god for that . almost spoke too soon . 
celtic should fold as a club for conceding to zapata tbh .
goooall ! zapata makes it 2-0 .
zonal marking is working well üôàüôâüôä 
were good enough at dishing out the zombie patter but both those corners tonight everyone stands like a fucking zombie and watches milan !

aaaaaaarrrrgggggghhhhh this milan team are the luckiest team i've ever seen
bye-bye celtic you separatist scum-bags !
milan are a very average side !! get stokes on ( or is he injured , i don't know ) and i still believe we can win this game 
3 -2 to celtic 
ha ! now van dijk puts the ball in to the net but it's called off-side . he's not having the best of days today . 
come on milan‚öΩÔ∏è
went through fucking 5 of them and emilio at the back post and not one could get a touch on it ! absolute shite celtic !
can't believe this ! honestly ! missed 2/3 sitters and lost 2 stupid set piece goals down to zonal marking 
buuuuut zapata ! celtic 0-2 milan ac ! 
that celtic goal was offside .
woops and again :-) 
" maybe it isn't just meant to be " or it could be that celtic are shite .
how the fuck did celtic no sign a striker in the summer ???????????
zapata in now for 2-0 at celtic park 
been stressed throughout group but all about taking your chances . van dijk should score and then milan get a second from a corner .
2-0 milan safe to say celtic are out of europe
celtic are so bad now its funny
right celtic that's me in from work . finger out ! 
barcelona and ac milan advance to the last 16
terrible defending again celtic ! never understand how a manager insists on zonal marking !!
zonal marking's fault again , and not the fault of 's shit defence !!!! 
nothing is going for celtic tonight
we fucked up in the summer buying reserve cheap players to play in the champions league 
important win for . hopefully they can get it .
ac milan has extended their lead ... 0-2 * vs celtic 
milan up 2-0 now
that's terrible from celtic . they've blown a huge opportunity . milan should have been vulnerable - especially at celtic park .
no rangers fan " obsesses " over celtic . we just love watching you get humped in europe .
celtic look like they are playing themselves out of the europa league
asked a friend , " what do your children learn about their anglo/celtic heritage at school ?" retort , " not a thing ". we're invisible .
haha celtic ur shit !!!!
celtic are cunts
goal ! zapata scores for milan at celtic park . 2-0 there .
get in round you celtic
ajax 2-1 barca celtic 0-2 milan cetic going out of the ucl
2-0 wht üôåüôåüôå you got this milan
losing 2 nil to the worst ac milan team i have ever seen
hey ole we'll jump on the heads of glasgow celtic hey ole
haha yes milan ! 
never thought i'd be writing drum parts for 10 minute long songs that go from celtic to caribbean to flamenco to mexican . 
fuck sake celtic !!!
why is this ref trying to square go folk in the celtic game ?
being honest celtic are the worst team ever and i don't give two shits if they have anything related to ireland/ira . they'd finish 14 in pl
- celtic 0-2 ac milan - zapata after d shameful miss
always nxt year celtic
celtic have a weaker defence than a south african hooker looking to make a quick buck üò´
allegri must have read the maestro's editorial today in gazzetta dello sport . sacchi told milan to take advantage of celtic's defense .
feel so sly on celtic are
i think it's safe to say it's not our night tonight 
in o'neill's in leeds . celtic v milan is on the big screen . fucking shit . get arsenal on .
ohh zonal marking again . shock horror ! 
zapata puts milan 0-2 up against celtic
celtic are playing fucking shit
this is hilarious ! 
fuck sake celtic . a chance at last 16 but you blow it . europa league will have to do , better than nothing 
fair play to commons , he is the best defender av seen play for milan since maldini . breaks up every attack without moving-genius at work !
samaras is pish why do celtic fans like him ?
celtic actually deserve to be winning just can't take there chances or defend corners
sorry to my celtic chums but yer teas oot ...
van dijk heads in for celtic , ruled offside though ! 
mon celtic theres still plenty of time left 
celtic fans are way too ambitiousüòÇ
milan look class everytime they attack , we want 5
massive chance missed and milan go up and score .. asleep at corners isnt good enough ! 
i really feel for those celtic supporters atm ... lol 
unlucky celtic lol
it would be so sick to play for celtic at home cause their crowd is rowdy 
two corners , two goals , looks like a pattern emerging here , mon tae fuck celtic !
so now we've both had a goal disallowed for offside , though frankly theirs was wise 
good job ,, 1 gol in fisrt game you are the best player for me forza22 milan celtik vs ac milan
lol worst celtic team av saw in years !! pure embarrassinüòÇ
it's not happening for celtic tonight
goal celtic dianulir karena offside 
get in milan - come on 8 more !! 
milan now lead celtic 2-0 in glasgow , christian zapata with the second . 
for fuck sake celtic .. missed a clear cut chance to make it 1-1 , milan go down and score to make it 2-0 
if milan are near the relegation in serie a , i'd imagine celtic would've been in lega pro by now .
celtic score on offside still 2 - 0
celtic are playing poor .. 
up there with 2 of the easiest goals you'll see scored in the them 2 milan goals . zonal marking at its worst 
dude scored vs celtic home and away .. celtic ' defense must be shyte for zapata to score ! efe ambrose is the weak link as usual !! rubbish player
this will be milan's first win since october 16th . ÓêíÓêíÓêí
celtic can fuck off
really poor from celtic , that
so unlucky for van dijk and celtic !
bye bye celtic
getting a lesson from milan on how to defend .
proper scottish league defending from celtic
milan scoring x2 from corners in 1 game . i'm confirmed to be dreaming .
just think of milan's 4 goals vs us .. vs chances we've had
cant get over how shit celtic are
 at least celtic can now concentrate on the scottish premier league now !!!
sorry celtiic , milan were soo shit in their last couplle of games ....... guesss your just really rubbish
sammy wins a throw in deep in the milan half , lennon looks totally gutted
same old celtic ........ shit
really isn't celtic's night
milan heading towards their 1st win in 8 games
goal celtic 0 ac milan 2 christian zapata 49min looks like celtic could be heading out
bye celtic
fuck off with yer zonal marking celtic . it doesn't fucking work !!!!!!!!!!!!
celtic proving they can't beat a 13th place serie a team , and they talk shit about juve .
sticking with celtic v ac milan for now . this way nige and mario are on .
2-0 <3 
worst thing is milan are a horrible outfit !
51 mins played . ajax . 2 . barcelona . 1 celtic . 0 . milan . 2
nobody to blame but ourselves ! 
finish 3-2 celtic
loi fans celebrating celtic losing . well done . the team you support is worse than them . rejoice
celtic vs milan ...
offside goals , absolutely heartbreaking üíî 
the celtic team of 10 years ago in the uefa cup final had 11 potential captains on the park and then jack mcnamara on the bench
celtic championship standard
the green brigade showing there true colours again tonight , the celtic board are terrified off them 
come on you boys in green !!! 
this is heartbreaking . 
michael dawson : celtic to win 2-0 commons and mulgrew then we will defo qualify for atleast the europa because ajax won't win 
51 ' celtic scores but it is offside
good to see celtic losing .
looks like celtic have lost their chances of qualifying now .
celtic need to learn how to man mark in the box ... their zone defence on corners clearly isn't working -_-
why do celtic continually stick with zonal marking it doesn't fucking work . get a man stick with him
van dijk scores the harder chance but its offside lmao 
the whole celtic team looking exposed tonite wee james teaching them a thing or two
goal for milan ..
half time in castlebar ... galway wfc 1 castlebar celtic 0
milan 2-0 , yep celtic are going yard
see when i changed my prediction from 2-1 celtic to 1-2 milan ..... change that to 0-4 milan .
celtic 2 nil down just as barca score and ajax down to 10 men , come on celtic nothing to lose .....
are celtic defenders wearing blind folds for every corner ? i swear i have never seen worse defending in my life ! :-)
ac milan doing what they do best ! 
thats me done with watching celtic tonight , zonal marking from a scottish team ? time to switch over and go on torres watch 
after that shocker of a display in the stands at parkhead i'm glad celtic are getting gubbed and ajax are winning
whoever is in charge of set piece defense coaching at celtic should be sacked . even i could do a better job ...
celtic thought they had pulled one back but the assistant's flag is raised for offside , correct decision .
come on celtic intae them
why the fuck are celtic zonal marking ?!
but ! 48 ' : celtic glasgow 0-2 milan ac ! 
i should be studying math but celtic-milan is on ... oh well fuck school
really . was it so certain we would beat milan . manager , scouting , transfers . id say all of the above .
milan and barca can both go to hell
goal celtic dianulir karena offside "
fucking horrendous celtic wae zonal marking
celtic's defence is absolutely horrendous .
lennon probably hate italian clubs , last season juve & now milan
two of the softest goals from milan , this feels like im watching norwich play again
thought milan were meant to be crap ?
sore one for celtic dont take a golden chance then conceding a soft one .
what a header samaras~ celtic 1- milan 2
my under 9s could have defended better than celtic have done for those two goals . very poor for this level .
celtic are so shit its funny . never did like them much . maybe its the fact that they're shit and support is based solely on sectarianism .
at least it's a good atmosphere at celtic park ... lol
let's all laugh at celtic nananana üëç
thought celtic would've bossed this game , clearly not thoughüôä
expecting abuse now from all the loyal celtic supporters sitting on their couch watching the game .
it must be horrible to be a celtic fan season over in november , no european football or old firm games üòÇ
nothing like learning from your previous error - and that was nothing like learning from your previous error 
forza milan and stick your shit stained bobby sands banner up your arse !
so i was eating my mum's supertasty lamb for dinner and missed the start of the celtic game . what's all this banner kerfuffle ?
that's no milan scored again that's fuckin amazin
why did i put celtic on my slip .... rule no . 1 never bet on scottish football 
basel , chelsea , barcelona and celtic thunder will fire you people if you people spoil my ticket o !
set pieces celtic can't defend ! hearts need to be working on that in training
a second goal from a corner for ac milan . this time nocerino volleys the ball into the path of zapata who makes no mistake . 
 didn't want to be in euro anyway .
just remember , ac milan are 13th in seria a .
celtic defence .: (((
ffs celtic kick it in the goal
i should take a trial for celtic as a centre back ...
milan 2-0 celtic üëç
don't know why celtic play samaras , worst player on the park , doing nothing but letting their attacks down .
everyone is so focused on the barca game lol !!! look at milan !
heart broken by celtic again .... could be worse i suppose ... i could be a hun ...
bye celtic
crazy to see the squad ac milan have now compared to 5 or 6 years ago
we miss a sitter , milan score , then score but offside . so frustrating .
thats what happens when you replace your best players with garbage 
haha hope celtic cone last
celtic stress me out
milan winning ajax winning , perfect night so farüòú
celtic have made it so difficult for themselves !
amateur defending from celtic . making the welfare look solid
celtic defence is so shit tonight üò†üò†
whats the odds only 2-2 draw with celtic and ac now ?
mon celtic bitta fucking fight
celtic should be level what a sitter ! should of won at the san siro first game aswell and close with barca . tut tut
dear celtic zonal marking doesn't fucking work .
our only hope is that barca come back against ajax and milan win next week , then a draw at the nc might give us a chance at third maybe ?
fucking fucking zonal marking ! 
would like to thank the celtic board for fucking our chance of progressing further in the cl , should have got proven goal scorer in . 
is it wrong to be amused that someone called zapata has knocked celtic out of europe during ?
celtic to win 8-2
poor performance from celtic ! should have scored on certain occasions and have better man-marking or zonal-marking !
goodbye celtic haha 
wow what chance u got when u canny finish atall and defend like a pub team ! get finger oot min celtic !!
down one end ( dick ) van dijk misses worse than a sitter , ac milan score instantly . is there any point to scottish football ?
celtic losing 2-0 milan all over them ...
can milan go bust aswell
' celtic - ynwa . let's go let's go '
ffs come on celtic
this milan team are that bad we can still get something out this game but we need to sharpen up
celtic set to appeal their european elimination to uefa on the basis that theyve " goat the best fans in europe "
if my u9 team conceded goals like celtic did i would be raging difference is celtic players r getting paid !
who scored the seconds for ac milan ?
commentator in the celtic milan game blaming the goals on zonal marking . more like woeful defending
celtic have had so many chances to be ahead in this game . sad really as id love to get them one day .
put the celtic game on if you're up for a laugh
goooooaaaal ! christian zapata makes it 2-0 for ac milan 
get in there . celtic losing 2-0 now
celtic losing 2-0
internet feed has crashed , do i want to find another one . too right ! c'mon celtic 
if celtic come back i'll propose .
to be fair to the celtic team they have an awful manager . anybody could win the scottish league with that team , lennon is a clown .
goal mk dons . celtic and rochdale needed on the goals galore .
i really really really hate celtic , and those unwashed tramps in the green brigade 
attack the ball , ffs ! 
come on celtic !!
ach well , canny expect too much given the shafting the board gave us in the summer # unforgivable 
aye that milan , not the team they used to be .
why is zonal marking the issue ? we have been playing the same system since strachan took over . just really bad defending . 
ac milan are cunts , always the team to piss everyone off üò≠
how does that celtic song go ? here we go again
i like this guy charlie mulgrew of celtic , versatile and always seem to play well against the big boys , be it at cb , lb or dm
milan were literally the worst team in the world at set pieces then they met celtic
zonal marking taking some more abuse from sky's commentators at celtic . pretty sure it's * bad * zonal marking that's the problem , muppets !
wouldn't be surprised if celtic fans left like they did against us ...
margins in football are so slim if van dijk had of scored that chance celtic were right in it , milan go down other end and score celtic out
further embarrassment for celtic ... üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©
porto , barca and milan all scored in the 49th minute there 
if only les mac aka the mushroom had been zonal marking me instead of man marking me for years i wud have got away with murder 
if celtic don't progress in the ucl it's basically the same season over and over again in the spl until rangers get back into it
celtic youv well n truly shot yourselves in the foot
but pour milan ac
goooooool !! 1st goal for the colombian cristian zapata with ac milan in the 
thats a bit better celtic atleast put up a fight noo ~hh~paddy bhoy
my gran is screaming at the telly whilst watching the celtic game , they canny hear u hahahah
it's fine anyway if the crash barriers get beat as long as a milan player comments on how magical the celtic fans were
dont get english people's problems with celtic . most of you's dont give a fuck about religion so ....
celtic out of more or less
shit . i hope celtic don't notice that we have a better manager than they do .
goalllll milan 2 - 0 celtic
what a wonderful goal from zapata !! go go !!! 
ac milan score again thts two nw
well this match is shit ... switching to the celtic game
lol @ celtic 
play as swell as you like , if you defend like celtic have tonight at corners a pub team would beat you !
 : 0 vs celtic : 0
i knew celtic would beat ac
looks like celtic are out
well that's their champions league hopes over 
chelsea - bradford - celtic 
oh , didn't even notice when fabregas got booked . he'll miss the last group game against celtic .
ozil missed a pk ??? awwww . . . rvp too . . balotelli over the weekend . . landed milan on 13th so . . .
well slit my wrists and call me sally ... sake celtic ...
celtic's getting beat 2-0 haha :)
remember when celtic would play strikers ? no , me neither
this one wey milan don dey score from corners , wonders indeed never end
poor play from celtic , they look devoid of ideas
half time castlebar celtic 0 1 galway wfc
lol celtic are 2-0 down . shame .
they'll be the second team to beat celtic at there house in the cl barca was the first !
ac milan 2-0 .. in scotland i definitely did not see that happening
nocerino just came on there against celtic and within a minute the commentator called him " nocerini " " nocerino " and " nocerina " 
celtic have been piss poor
hope celtic defend like this on sunday üòú
chris zapata getting on the scoresheet for milan
lol wanted celtic to win
such a shame as well , celtic had been the better side , just too sloppy
 goals have been conceded from two of the most badly defended corners i've seen in a long while 
bye bye celtic
only watching my milan ‚ù§Ô∏è
celtic üòû
in many many ways it pains me to say this but tonight i make an exception forza milan !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
celtic better score i've got both teams to score
twitter is so funny when celtic are losing . i love it
got ¬£3 on ac milan 3-0 though
milan go 2- 0 up ... hahaha comeone boys lol awsome stuff kill them .... ajax please lose to make my day complete
i was wrong , and milan are winning , which is secretly wonderful 
knew a shouldn't have put celtic on my coupon . stupid terrorists .
wasnt gonna watch tonight but i`m glad i did <3 forza milan <3
hazard coming on watch him change the game and bye bye celtic üòï
having been so keen to lay milan at 2.5 you can imagine what i'd be at 1.1 . if i had any money left .
gotta love our south american connection . kak√† + zapata . 2-0 forza milan !! 
defending set plays for celtic tomorrow morning !! 
only a few teams in the world can pull off zonal marking . celtic aren't one of them . 
yet again celtic defence is fucking rotten
i see the celtic 1st team impersonating as under 10s at defending
embarrassing , completely embarrassing defending for the two goals against the worst milan team ever .
let's go acm ‚òùÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
fucking celtic ... you can't ever rely on them bastards ! 69
typical celtic , flashes of brilliance , lots of poor passing and basic defending errors .
wow it's so hard being a celtic fan 
milan i font le taff fau ke chelsea i marke ociii 
ah celtic üíî
ac milan #2 -0 
so far so good for my boyhood heroes ac milan . 
why are you doing this celtic ?!
celtic getting slapped . come on milan . only 1 real team in glasgow !
better aff entering celtic for the ramsdens cup next year
making the worst ac milan team to ever play in the champions league look unbelievable .
c'mon celtic !!! we need winners here üîë
corner celtic , good work by forrest
wonder if mcginn is wearing his celtic top tonight to cheer on the bhoys
how about signing al sheraway of ac milan
bye bye celtic maybe one day you will respect remembrance sunday maybe one day i will care about you in europe ta ta
strange tactic by celtic to play a game of musical statues every time milan get a corner . not sure it's working .
how do you win a game without having a striker 
be funny if someone whipped out a gun and started blasting all them celtic fans doing them displays at celtic park , sick bastards .
this is a really poor milan team , says a lot about our team
 in charge at celtic park
hope ajax hold on against barca as it means dirty celtic are out of europe 
milan are just awful ... but they're in good company ... ironically . 
celtic , losing bravely to milan ...
celtic are so open ! 
cmon celtic , what's going on ?
celtic are a travesty end of
celtic have been so unlucky in every champions league match
arguably the worst defending i've ever seen shambolic !
2-0 milan . sickkkk ones
boooom celtic v milan btts @ 5/6 danny
milan 2-0 celtic
just not meant to be celtic's night here
i'm guessing celtic aren't playing well with the amount dads screaming at the tv
on the plus side , celtic are losing , vile club
milan scored the second , ajax's player got sent off ( the ref couldn't let them lose ) and barcelona scored .
goal ! zapata doubles milan's lead and surely kills off celtic chances of going past the group stages , this season , milan lead 2-0
celtic and zonal marking don't go together .. shocking for both goals 
ive wrote a celtic song , it goes lets not mark anyone , lets not mark anyone ! lets cost dabek money ! cost dabek money !
celtic-milan 0-2 ...
when i see celtic i go out of my head i just can't get enough i just can't get enough
milan is so fucking rude .
a poor milan team as well ... performance of a lifetime now !
milan are the 1st side to score twice at park in the group stage since won 3-1 there in sept . ' 04
 will be bitterly disappointed with the two goals they've conceded tonight from set-pieces . 
what was i thinking celtic are piss
happy for milan . 2 goals up ! allegri needs some breathing space . 
* wonders if jackie mcnamara is celtic-minded enough *
" milan to win champions league " -tweets coming up in 3 , 2 , 1 ..
why are itv showing this arsenal game . barca vs ajax celtic vs milan and dortmund vs napoli would have been better choices
celtic are shocking and this kill me sayin it 
milan giving celtic that work
zapata scores for milan ... now 2 nil for milan
hahaha fuck the celtic scum
fuck sake celtic , bring back balde n caldwell ! 
celtic are scared to spend money min
it's not even a joke ac milan are shite
that milan keeper is ma da
european football 101 . must take chances , otherwise you will be punished . 
celtic are playing shit
this is the worst ac milan team i've ever watched and yet they're able to score at ease against celtic
fuck celtic
celtic's set-piece defense against milan is very milan-esque
celtic are toast . they should just forget about the knock-out stages . 
every time av went for a pish milan have scored
don't know who's having a worse game , celtic defence or davie provan 
thats absolutely fucking atrocious from celtic . sickening .
is it just me or does the ac milan manager have a look of nick from coronation street about him ?
2-0 milan are beatable start taking your chances !
massive fist pump when milan scored to make it 2-0 ! 
celtic are going out no way they are going through now they are 2-0 down zapata with the goal 
i guess me and milan are getting married
think it's time for me to go & eat my feelings . fu celtic !
celtic being manhandle tonight . great i hate them too .
if there is any team that can give up a 2 goalie lead with 35 minutes to go it's ac milan !
typical football celtic miss a sitter and milan go up and score
kaka looking back to his old self again , made by milan , ruined by madrid to be made by milan once again
oh dear celtic
the defending from both ac milan and celtic has been fucking attroutious . when did ac become so shit ? moyes should have bought kaka .
this must be one of the worst milan teams ever !
incredible result from ajax and milan tonight !!! 
shoulda bet pon milan !
hope celtic come last
but milan and ajax are fucking silly , why didn't they play like this in their other matches ??
don't think celtic know how to defend :/ started off so well : z 
last year's team would have beaten milan home and away . we're weaker but with last season's expectations . unrealistic .
the irony of milan scoring from set pieces is hilarious
hate zonal marking for corners it doesn't work it never has . also had celtic kept hold of their best players they'd have cruised this group
" celtic will comeback "... hahaha that's the sorta chat that me and my pals say when we're wired to the moon . talk shite shite and more shite
after watching the celtic and chelsea game , turn on arsenal and thought the sound was broken 
class - difference between ac milan and celtic
milan are pish , not even surprised celtic are winning 2-0
celtic are incapable of learning any lessons about naive mistakes in europe . time and time again it's the same mistakes .
thanks celtic for killing any buzz for this game with 40 mins still left .
alright , ac milan are doing big in the ucl ? why the hell are they 13 in the league
milan scoring 2goals from cornerkicks in a single match 
will be sad to see celtic's european campaign end early . being in ireland during the champions league qualifiers was great
come on you hoops ! 
milan finishing top if group with barca second
oh dear celtic how sad , never mind .
go go go go .. can still top the group 
milan pasti lo2s .. ‚ô¨(-_-‚òÖ) s'mngat .. 
taking chances and defending properly are things celtic don't seem to be able to do this season in the ucl
keep it up milan !! 2-0
celtic would be fighting relegation in the premier league
always fight milan
celtic are having more possession than milan . celtic .
never have been a fan of zonal marking , never will be ! celtic have just proved why it doesnt work ! 
if milan win tonight without concedeing im prepared to give allegri one last chance
can you hear that electric scary champions league celtic sky sports atmosphere !?? nope , me neither . but messi said they sang loads !
there's goals to be had here for celtic , this milan team look very poor
fuck you celtic hahaha
hate celtic , glad they're losing
zonal marking not working so well for celtic tonight 
i see a few celtic fans over social media banging on about us being ' hun bastards ' and calling zapata a ' black bastard '... best fans ever( ! )
oh fuck all milan .
 2-0 
people who say ' celtic ' without the ' t ' really annoy me !!
53 mins gone and celtic win a corner .... which the goalkeeper gathers fairly easily ... 0-2 milan and u would hv to say they're cruising
oh its finished ! might have to put celtic v ac milan on ! arsenal and chelsea matches are boring !
that sort of defending will definitely cut it in the english top flight , celtic would manage to compete
lennon has to take a lot of the blame for those 2 milan goals if he set his defence up to defend like mannequins
come on barcelona , i want to at least watch celtic in the europa league ...
lovely tackle on forrest . 
celtic out
can we play celtic every sunday ? -gc
just support celtic cause they're scottish
cheers celtic
stuck a tenner on celtic to win 2 - 1 the minute i do so ..... we'll you know the rest 
genuinely think celtic shouldnt be 2-0 down , bit better defending and it could still be 0-0
who popped again for milan plz
celtic have shot themselves in the foot with marking like that .. twice aswell
time to take some pride back celtic , c'mon tae fek !
if the score stays like this coupons up but would gladly sacrifice it for another 2 from 
remember that time a celtic fan tapped the milan keeper on a shoot out
had to shut my bedroom window because the noise from celtic park was so loud 
it‚Äôs great to talk about atmospheres and the likes but if you can‚Äôt beat the worst ajax and milan sides in living memory‚Ä¶ .
milan no wins & no clean sheets in their last 11 away games ,, until tonight but they are playing lennons keech
celtic you are wank
hehe bye celtic
celtic score one please
milan have scored again
jesus what are celtic at
celtic have to be the most frustrating team in the world to support .
celtic are out , 2-0 milan

2-0 milan and it's a big bye bye celshit and your terrorist loving fans .. may you get what you deserve which is fuck all . 
of be celtic 2 gol at laan .
goal !!! 49 ' c . zapata strikes a blow on celtic's chances to advance beyond the group stages . celtic 2-0 ac milan .
celtic haven't learned anything in the past 3 seasons : the champions league is all about finishing your chances . 
awww celtic are losing
nice one , laters celtic
if i was mikael lustig i would ask to leave the club , far too good for celtic
think this game pretty much sums up how celtic are as a team in europe and that unfortunately is bang average !! 
annoying that celtic fans always have something to say about rangers if we are getting beat haha
come on celtic !
neil lennon is only the manager of celtic because he's considered a club legend . the man has very little managerial talent , just some cash .
love it milan 
the celtic strip is by far the ugliest designed football strip , i'm no seeing the liking of those green & white stripes 
get it up yes celtic
c'mon celtic intae this mob
one of the worst home displays i've ever seen from celtic tonight
yes fuck off celtic you cunts
allegri saved by celtic ..
oh , didn't even notice when fabregas got booked . he'll miss the last group game against celtic .
oh , didn't even notice when fabregas got booked . he'll miss the last group game against celtic .
bye bye celtic unlucky
2-0 milan and i have celtic on . wasnt a good decision on my behalf .
celtic getting beat always puts me in a good mood
the news from glasgow is not good ? ac milan winning is fucking fantastic
peak 4 celtic
not celtic's night üôâ
apparently its bad news that celtic are losing , no it isn't , i don't care .
ha fuck off celtic
watching this ac milan vs celtic match
wow don't deserve to go through anyways .. or in this team .. not a very well put together team 
looks like this referee is suffering from the top club virus too . jesus christ . seems like milan all over again . or madrid . 
don't mind conceding goals against teams like ac milan but from 2 floated in corners makes me so angry ! 
lol fuck celtic
come on milan
you hear champions league atmospheres at celtic and other big clubs . then arsenal fans are just sitting there eating there crumpets 
home time for celtic fans

celtic look to be heading to defeat against ac milan , zapata doubles milan's lead , 0-2 
celtic are disgracing the fine record set by scottish clubs going all the way back to the 60s . milan hadn't won in scotland till tonight .
almost every one of our corners has been caught by abiati . haven't troubled him . stark contrast to us last year and milan today .
ac milan have extended their lead against celtic through cristian zapata and it is now 2-0
looks like celtic is doing shit
better at defending set pieces than celtic ** 
celtic cannot defend !! shown how brutal the cl is , miss a sitter then bang , 2-0 
the astonishing thing is your average celtic fan kens fuck all about politics in anywhere other than northern ireland . vermin .

plucky , brave , shite celtic .
can't qualify for the last 16 without big vic can ya celtic ?
big hun at my work said 3 nil to milan .
corner to arsenal a good volley from √∂zil , taken short and lots of passing and offside ... celtic 0-2 ac milan , ajax 2-1 fc barcelona ... -j
frantic start to second half in group . milan go 2-0 up and celtic have goal disallowed . also ajax down to 10 men n 2-1 up v barca
let's all laugh at celtic , let's all laugh at celtic la la la la
celtic can finally get off their champions league high horse
dads awfully quiet üò≥ i'll take it celtic are losing
" touch tight marking from milan ." - aye , rub it in , davie .

just catching up on the highlights of the goals so far tonight . in conclusion , neither or √ßa can defend . 
milan is winning against celtic . 2-0
ye ha so easy for milan
celtic just why would ya bother even supporting them .. any scottish team is just pointless .. the country's pointless
aye , milan are pish after all .
who gives a flying fuk about celtic/scottish football 
fuck . sake . celtic . 
celtic should seriously bring hooper on of they're looking a goal 
bonus for barca and maybe for celtic - ajax down to ten men . can barca get the win ?
" news from glasgow & it's not good , milan have doubled their lead " speak for yourself , that's fucking fantastic news
did anyone get on our milan away win @ 6/4 we tipped on the match preview on the blog ? sorry we didn't put it up on the tips page
well in milan
there's nothing like learning new things on guitar to make you realize you know nothing about guitar . acm you make me feel so stupid
milan are a bunch of whippets
just noticed that the ref in the celtic match is the same feckin eejit that sent nani off v madrid last year
i've actually got so much to do but instead i'm sitting in the bath watching the celtic game üò´üòÇ
assist amended to nocerino for the milan 2nd goal .
assist amended to nocerino for the milan 2nd goal .
if celtic are the best in scotland , football is fucked
fucking hate watching celtic like !!!
meanwhile celtic losing 2-0 to milan .
balloteli looks like an absolute player for ac milan
fucking embarrassing . the most cowardly celtic team i've seen
in both of our games milan have been so average , and so so so lucky
well looks like 's european adventure is coming to a screeching halt today oh well 
2-0 what are you's doing celtic .
o good , celtic are losing 2-0
may be the weakest milan side in years , but compare the values of the teams on the pitch , still worlds apart .
neil lennon after the game " at least we outsung 350 milan supporters "
heres a tip celtic . .. give up
shows ya how bad celtic are gettin beat from this average milan side
how can milan fans even celebrate with the form there in , jesus .
get it together celtic üò©
celtic are out of their depth in the cl . i understand they beat barca and all but that was a once off
when will we buy a striker ?? 
celtic . breaking my heart again . urgh .
celtic fans moaning about defending set pieces . lack of practice that . nae team in the premiership gets given sets pieces against them !
fuck u celtic glad am no watchin it 
champions al momento : ajax 2 barcelona 1 , milan 2 celtic 0
embarassingly bad defending of corners 2nite by celtic . 
you know it's milan when you see urby playing as a lb and poli as a rb
you know what celtic do my head in sometimes . big opportunity in last 2 games and feck it up and we still need a striker . ambition hmmmmm
watching kaka in a milan shirt like the good old days ! all that and some breaking bad equals a good night
celtic losing again in europe , such a shame . 
well that's the celtic bet fucked
 keep the faith bhoys and ghirls . but please lenny drop the zonal marking 
celtic are a horrible club . dont deserve a place in the most high profile club competition anyway 
no more goals in the ac milan game are needed !!! fuck w/ me soccer gods .
fucking zonal marking ! get a grip celtic !
surely celtic is minutes away for champions league exit ... clock ticks
bye bye celtic
oh goodbye celtic your shite
ffs celtic . we r better than this .
2 nil down nothing's happenin make a fucking change worst milan team i have ever seen this is poor
do the celtic defenders have imaginary teammates that they are relying on to defend their goalmouth - shocking defending .
watching ac milan v celtic im proud of urby emanuelson hes came a long way since i gave him his start on football manager
somebody please tell the players they are allowed to move when defending corners in the box . 
the worst thing is this is the crapest milan team in a long time ...
yes ! zapata scored the second for milan and xavi scores the first for barca !! 
the celtic defending for those 2 goals . hand your keys in a reception lads , this clearly isn't going to work ....
worst cl hame performance i can remember ! 
thank fuck a inform milan side didn't come to parkhead tonite the way this is going
thanks itv for giving us that bang up to date goal news from celtic park that was news everywhere else 5 minutes ago .
celtic might make it 2-2 but their defence is useless
ac milan is a champions league team , regardless of whats going on in the season , they still pull through
celtic need an oscar rubio in their team to sort out that marking .
milan keepers name sounds like a pasta .. maybe just coz am peckish
i love seeing celtic get beatüôä makes me happy !! üëåüòÜ hehehe
who scored milan's second ?
celtic are scum .
waw milan finally going win today
" news from glasgow and it isn't good . milan double there lead ". sorry ? why's it bad ( or good) . could not give two shits about celtic .
 
yeah , fuck off celtic .
a celtic result in europe is only ever a miracle , despite commentators expectations that they should win .
don't look good for 
 gift top class opposition 2 goals . embarrassing . can't watch anymore of this utter crap - particularly as its non-contact
milan go 2-0 up against celtic thanks to zapata . celtic face an enivitable elimination
dammit celtic .
 can guarantee zonal marking will get the blame for milan's goals when in reality thick players are to blame ... 
celtic playing well but getting nothing .
celtic best team in scotland next joke üòÇ
frustrating watching celtic tonight . basic defensive errors aswell as what is now becoming regular misfiring in front of goal
milan scouting report says they like to give up leads to shite teams , but never teams that are this shite ! 2nd last game in europe this year
milan gagne 2-0 sans pression 
fuck ac milan , always cheating .
celtic are shocking
fuck sake celtic üò©
we have a left back in midfeild & a left winger upfront . just shows we never replaced hooper & wanyama ! 
fuck sake celtic x 
that team can't string two passes together ... literally can't!! i've seen better passing in benburbeau ! 
bet van dyke of celtic feels a right dick now .
always a disappointment when watching celtic
if theres a fat lady beside you , gag her ! refuse to give up on this ! mon celtic !
watching the chelsea , milan , and barca game at the same time
don't think its meant to be for in this years . shocking defending for both goals against very average milan side ...
kaka is actually a different player in a milan shirt , love him
look at celtic's team when they were scoring for fun . they had one talisman and a decent striker . they need a finisher
zapata has scored more goals against celtic than real sociedad have scored in total in the champions league .
another disgusting celtic banner tonight , fucking horrible child molesting fenian bastards
given that the celtic supporters who are involved in these things seem to love bobby sands , i'd like to know their view of gerry adams .
ita not frustrating watching celtic getting beat , its frustrating at the things the players do
can't believe celtic fans were actually arguing with me that they'd beat milan . was never going to happen , poorest celtic team in years .
celtic have shot themselves in the foot against milan . the 4 goals over the 2 legs were poor defending or lucky . 
fuck yass milan ! now a couple more arsenal goals please
 really scraping the barrel tonight .
celtic staging reenactment of old godzilla movie tonight . defence playing the part of japan . 
c'mon ac milan , easy opponents but still putting on a show against the glasgow b team . 
c'mon to fuck 
hope hearts put celtic out the cup now then there season will be over . then see how many of there moron fans turn up every week
c'mon ac milan , easy opponents but still putting on a show against the glasgow b team . 
kaka make it a lead for milan
another example of celtic playing well box to box , but crap in the box
if mikael lustig's planning on leaving celtic any time soon , that's me . finito .
haha fuck off celtic
word i feel sorry for celtic they put in work to make it to champions league to get one peak group every year üòÇüòÇ
zonal marking ? 
 2 - 1 
celtic losing by 2
some shocking defending has surely put paid to in the ... school boy stuff
that'll be celtic out then !
jesus celtic get mullgrew aff tay fuk !!
so many celtic haters just remember there the reason scottish football is still respected by other leagues .
celtic 0 -2 milan .
goodbye celtic
forza milan ! always fight
celtic being 2 down is not ' bad news from glasgow ' tyldsley
jesus celtic 
oppppppps milan 2 nil up now , some might say they are streaking ahead ......
can anyone remember what i said about kaka ' before returning to milan ? many saying he was over the hill and what did i say ? 
please dear ac milan , do not score any more goal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
celtic heavy cant defend . lost 2 goals that could have been easily avoided .
better off puting stevie wonder and stephen hawking up front for celtic . like a fucking graveyard up front . no movement or nothing .
celtic deserve to be 2 nil down , scum
the game lasts until the final whistle !! come on celtic , get intae them !!!!!!!!!!
nice 1 milan ... stuff the hooped scot porridge eating bad speaking haggis shagging arse wipes
lot of folks were all exited last summer with th cl draw ... exited to see ur team get crushed ?.. hope next season we got a easy group 
wow , can't ever have score two easier champions league goals than they have tonight . 
celtic have cost themselves this game so far 
the only thing worse than watching losing in the is having to listen to the sky sports commentary . 
who were celtic fans kidding thinking they would win tonight and still qualify
it's hard to differentiate between celtic on the ipad and ' adventure time ' on the telly . finn is probably better than most of our squad .
celtic's school boy defending tonight has been a joke . what r you's doing !? 
celtic have really missed hooper and wanyama in europe this season
please celtic , porto and chelsea score üôè
pure keek 
milan are the 1st side to score twice at park in the group stage since won 3-1 there in sept . ' 04
hope milan win ! hate lennon
love ac milan
people having a laugh thinking celtic would beat milan . despite their form - a massive difference between serie a & shitty scottish football
hurts watching celtic , so focused on afc wimbledon 
another shooting on the celtic side it's a drive by
milan are comically bad . no rhythm , no intensity . like watching shit hang from a stick
 2 - 0 
i don't think milan have earned a single goal against celtic over these two games . they've been gifted everything .
haha fuck off celtic . tossers . scum of footbal .
c'mon celtic
cheerio celtic 
where are all you glory supporting celtic bastard now ? only pipe up when you win ..... jagger would be ashamed 
shame about celtic
goodnight , celtic . it's a shame , always hope the scottish teams do well in europe .
can i assume that milan have scored a second with the frenzy of yasssssssss tweets on my tl 
if ac milan were against a half decent team they'd be getting a doing
samaras has hardly touched the ball ! get him off and throw on stokes or blade to see what they can do ! 
those statues in the celtic box better watch they dont get traffic cones put on their heads ...
celtic fans dont half get angry when there losing haha
celtic are such a strong attacking team
celtic should not be allowed enter the champions league . joke of a team
get in there my boy !!! #2 -0 .. just need barca to come back now and beat ajax :d !! 
goal !!! 49 ' c . zapata strikes a blow on celtic's chances to advance beyond the group stages . celtic 2-0 ac milan .
neill lennon may as well throw on stokes as an extra striker . he has nothing to lose now 
celtic commentary on while doing this study . in 10 mins they've had a missed sitter , disallowed goal and conceded . lets hope i'm more lucky
absolute pish celtic
love when everything goes bad for celtic , don't gloat about european football if your teams proper pish in it
wonder if celtic park is bouncing ?
defo made a good account of ourselves in the champions league two years in a row now . unlucky in milan . should of drawn with barca ..
milan double their lead at celtic park as zapata taps in from close range . is that curtains for neil lennon's side in the season's ?
milan ! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
celtic are providing strong evidence to suggest that zonal marking doesn't work .
can somebody please explain why clive tyldesley described milan going 2 up at park head as ‚Äú not a good thing ‚Äù ?? 
were playing the worse milan team ever then thank fuck or it would be a rugby score the reality is we are pish samaras having one 
57 ' commons ( celtic ) is booked !
kris commons booked . celtic 0 milan 2 after 56mins
2-0 milan 2-0 ajax it's been a good day : 3
glad that celtic are losing , they're not good enough to be in the cl to begin with , and neil lennon losing is always nice 
ave watched this celtic game for 10 mins and seen mulgrew give the ball away/lose possession 4 times 
piss poor celtic , zonal markings shocking , need a goal scorer ! awell europe done for a season !
so milan are winning against celtic 2-0
celtic are dirt haha
go milan :) !!!
losing a home record to probably one of the worst milan teams in history !! well done lenny !! 1 up front in a game we must win 
commons booked ( yellow card ) 
murdering celtic on 207
celtic are two down now whilst ajax still lead , surely is down and out for celtic in this years champions league 
itv commentator just now : " there's news from glasgow is not good . milan have doubled their lead at celtic park ". what's not to like ?
celtic are playing shitt
never seen a celtic defence as bad as that at corners . u wouldn't expect ac to score from set pieces against them .
if celtic get knocked out tonight i hope neil lennon gets sacked so we can have him and get rid of hughton 
domestic abuse must be set to rise the night . celtic down by 2 goals
celtic 2-0 down . you useless shits .
celtic need an elephants foreskin here a huge come back !!!!
ahh we'll that's celtic out ! doesn't matter another go next year not like rangers are going to be competing ha !
neil lennon must be thinking , " this italian lot . first juventus last season . now a down-and-out milan ." don't bet against calcio ... :)
typical celtic fan : * de jong gets pulled down * " how is that a foul you nob "
celtic 2-0 down . good , hate the fuckers !!!
ridiculous !! back them to the hilt , support through thick & thin , spend money on tickets and they reward you with that shit !!! 
celtic useless at this so called zonal defending and i don t trust them relying on the offside trap for their defensive stratagy ......
hold on milan
come on to fuck celtic !
no lack of effort from celtic . however , lack of guile , strikers and defensive naivety have cost us dearly this cl campaign .
celtic have lost 10 of their 22 european games against italian sides ( w5 d7) . 
i hate rangers i hate celtic the end .
come on celtic .. better then this . two gifts of goals to concede . barca staging a comeback in the dam too 2-1 now ajax down to 10
ac milan are class
when was the last time milan was leading a game by 2-0 ?? can't remember .
what celtic did was take a team with 5 decent players , sold 3 of them , bought nobody to replace them . shocked that never worked out for them
and i don't think commons has what it takes at champs league level 
aren't milan man marking ? haven't they gave us two free digs from 6 yards ? yes .
it looks like half a dozen celtic players have already given up
celtic may forget about it
does anyone want sceptic to beat milan ?
provan is going on about milan keeper not being confident , he's been out claiming crosses whilst forster stands with his dick in his hands .
celtic have to ditch this zonal marking , okay against st mirren and killie but against decent players they are gash at it !!
wow n milan is winning ??
now you see why i said milan are falling to the ground too easy ?!! hh -jaybhoy-
this is a poor milan team and celtic have gave them two early xmas presents 
champions league your having a laugh ;-)
should be a red card for celtic skipper
milan !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ‚ô• * happy-dancing *
amazing how's kaka going in there in milan
some shocking defending from celtic , imagine what it would be like if they were playing a good team ... like killie .
this result confirms only one thing , that the celtic park stadium staff won't be getting the pay rise in line with the minimum wage ...
anyone got celtic on their acca ? lol .
i still love you celtic even if you can't defend corners .
celtic are playing like a sunday league team
celtic race to 9 and torquay race to 7 double @ 3.45
dundee could bet celtic there that fucking shite stick yir 10 in a row up yir arse away the dee
celtic fans really do alienate their club with banners like the one tonight . in 2013 , at a football match , what relevance does it have ?
this is what i like the most about fans ! they support the team even in worse moments !! they are 12th player !
i milan are shit same as ajax bye bye celtic hahahaha .. and playing a guy who gets his dick out for fun disgraceful
 0-2 ! 
a steward at parkhead is sitting quietly on a chair in what celtic fans are calling an " act of severe provocation ".
2 really poor goals to hand milan , zonal marking is about as much use as cancer
that's it for me watching celtic-outright incompetence when it comes to defending-pathetic . not gonna break it down bc it's just too bad .
champions league : celtic-milan 0-1 at half time glasgow - milan are leading 1-0 over celtic at half-time in the champion ...
oh celtic
must be frustrating but giving away needless free kicks in areas where milan are going nowhere isn't helping celtic to get back into this
i love celtic ... there just so unlucky
celtic please just score
celtic are terrible
time for celtic to bring their big champions league signing on ....
don't know what's worse the fact i'm watching celtic vs milan or the commentary and punditry from tv3 ! 
celtic will never be a champions league team .
am i right in thinking that if scores stay as they are then celtic are out of europe ?
celtic's champions league dream quickly coming to an end ... 
where are all you glory supporting celtic bastards now ? only pipe up when you win .... jagger would be ashamed 
fraser foster's chances of playing for england in the 2014 world cup going down the pan as quickly as celtic's champions league aspirations
milan up 2-0 ‚ö´Ô∏èüî¥‚ö´Ô∏èüî¥‚ö´Ô∏è what a great day honestly
my tweet from 1hr ago has come to fruition . milan 2-0 . game over i'd imagine . 
fuck the celtic 5
goal ! celtic 0 , milan 2 . cristian zapata ( milan ) right footed shot from very close range to the bottom right corner
this celtic games a joke the ref wants sacking u can tell wot side he's on mon the hoops
i wonder who lennon will blame if celtic lose this one . it's very likely it'll be anyone but himself or his team .
milan fans are louder than the celtic fans .
if u shop in the bargain basements what do celtic expect at this level ? 
fucking press celtic !!
celtic - setting teams that are doing shite back on the right path 
all i hear from the fans at the stadium is ... forza milan !!!!!
lack of quality up front showing at the moment , sammy is doing nothing as a lone striker . 
celtic have as much chance of getting out this group as lostprophets do of every appearing on blue peter next week .
fucking don't believe it i missed a goal , i turned it over and missed it . aw well giruy timmy !!!!! üáÆüáπforzaüáÆüáπmilanüáÆüáπ
celtic are outta here
put on channel 3 to see if a could get into this football malarky , took me about 10 mins to realise no ones in green so this isney celtic .
should of put milan instead of celtic
fuckin pish celtic simple as that
 nothing to lose now ! throw on an extra striker !
seriously , is there any evidence of celtic fans actually showing any real understanding of the ni conflict ?
but nah seriously its cool coz ac milan are in meltdown just now and ah crumbs .
i kind of feel sorry for celtic ... lol do i fuck , hope milan score even more goals , just so i can laugh even more
c'mon celtic üçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄ
get in milan !!! be assed with celtic !!!
milan cheeks gonna be soooo freakin chubby .
another quality night in watching celtic get beat # 
unlucky celtic , chin up
bring on tony watt ffs 
the milan fans yelling at the top of their lungs in glasgow's east end tonight . 
by by celtic
i'm actually a bit gutted for celtic ...
zombies laughing at celtic getting beat by ac is like laughing at a man for only bucking lucy pinder . wild them dead folk !
celtic had 2 good chances to score before milan did . difference in quality evident ...
wah ac milan 2-0 celtic ... like milan find winnings form 
i think it has all caught up with us tonight , gave away two goals which was a gift to milan . dont believe milan is better then us . 
celtic may as well just go gungho nothing to lose now
samaras is terrible 
the first goal milan scored . jesus , you wouldn't see that down the little vic sunday league .
a love it 
celtic are looking more exposed than james forrest on a night out
keeping up with the game via the celtic twitter . i accept all offered condolences .
 milan winning easy without moving out 2nd gear
wow that famous celtic park atmosphere is in real swing now isn't it 
celtic missing a big chance of cl progression . this milan side are very average . poli , zapata & birsa nothing special
why is scott brown in goals for milan ?
as they say in " bon voyage " 
celtic the cunts ruining my tuesday night without i'm a celeb
haha fuckoff celtic you cunts !!!
watching flamini makes you think what went wrong at milan ? it's not like they've been blessed with great defensive midfielders recently .
celtic better start playing football ‚öΩüçÄ
loads of killie fans on here obsessing about celtic ? 
not good enough celtic ! zonal marking has been the death of us tonite ! 
we're watching a team who have heroically overachieved returning to the mean . not enough quality or depth compared to last year
the celtic manager looks like a leprechaun üòÇüòÇ
pick it up celtic
strange how when celtic are winning my twitter looks like i live in dublin , pretty much fuck all tonight though .
celtic cannot expect to compete at champions league level with charlie mulgrew in centre midfield
looks as though not going to happen for celtic then :-(
losin to the worst ajax and milan team in years .. thats what happens wen the moneymen tighten up their purses .. not good enough
and we are out of europe 
might be the weakest milan team in years but we're not exactly knocking the ball up to larsson hartson or sutton either
this is going from worse to worse . celtic wtf !
milan are fine ? i dnt think so . allegri should be sacked as soon as possible üëå
celtic are much poorer this season . money in the bank doesn't = goals
the ac milan keeper is so good at coming and claiming balls from corners and crosses wish i was as good
can you hear that ? curva sud chanting in celtic park ??
any team can make an effort for european games , celtic fans are utter shite !
one goal for celtic is all that's needed to turn this game around .
sorry ajax the red card changed it ... in the mean time milan :)
go milan go !!!!
wheres your famous atmosphere ? 
we are celtic supporters , faithful through & through over and over we will follow you . hh !
instead we find ourselves 0-2 down at home to a bad milan side .
celtic = 1st in scotland . ac milan = 14th in serie a , 4 points from 20th and 18 from top . shows the gulf in class between the two leagues .
looks like celtic are out then . got the toughest possible group though .
win , lose or draw , celtic always üëèüíö
he's blown yet another treble . he's getting us embarrassed against a terrible milan side and in europe in gen . how can lennon be defended ??
the ac milan squad all have weird numbers . 22 , 45 , 34 , 80 and so on .
milan shouldn't have released pirlo .
looks like celtic are out !
this is an fm moment for celtic . the opposition haven't won away all season so it would have to be against you .
big nights like that celtic are not good enough too carry passengers like samaras and commons
goooooaaaal ! christian zapata makes it 2-0 for ac milan goooooaaaaal ! xavi scores from penalty 49 ' ajax 2-1 barca 
why do the commentators always talk about celtic and how good they are at home or the special atmosphere . they are getting beat shut up !
between the canucks and celtic i feel like shite ....
don't think i've ever seen a team defend as bad as celtic tonight 
kaka and milan are both killing it at celtic park .
that picture of the celtic fan with half his face spread on the concrete is horrible
celtic why are you playing so shite !
peter lawwell has confirmed that the celtic defence will not receive the living wage .
we look beat already 
when you're 2-0 down with half an hour to go is exactly the time the team need support , where the fuck are the celtic fans ?
ac milan at 6/4 is just far too easy btw haha !
awkward moment when you're in the pub and there's only two of you that cheer when milan score 
at least give rogic some cl experience , never know , he might actually do something worthwhile 
milan players need to man up
where is this ' special ' atmosphere that celtic park has on european nights :/
celtic c'mon to fuck !
celtic don't seem 2b walking alone 2nite , think ac might nick that song coz clearly their walking alone at parkhead 2nite 
celtic have as much chance of getting out this group as lostprophets do of appearing on blue peter next week .
mon celtic ! just get one <3
milan have just been too well organised . celtic look poor again , unusual at home !
fair to say we've beaten ourselves tonight ! not seen anything special about milan . 
celtic need the likes of paul telfer and lee naylor back in the team
well celtic probably out of europe now ... on a plus side and there is one it will save me pennies
although celtic are in the champions league united are playing better football than them in the spl atm
ac milan and kaka are both killing it at celtic park .
celtic would be such a frustrating team to support , i honestly believe i could play holding midfield for them ! 
meanwhile celtic are losing 2 - 0 to ac milan .
c'mon celtic 
celtic's champions league campaign has been nothing short of pathetic . 2 goals in 5 matches and those were a penalty and massive deflection .
celtic are failing in winning ways
ref is a absolute fucking knob in the celtic game complete fucking fanny
fuck off celtic . scouse cunts .
whit dae celtic see in that neil lennon cunt ? hes achieved just as much as every other celtic manager

alright ac milan$$$

celtic 0-3 milan : balotelli ! he ran on to a long ball and powered home ! 
* chuckle * * chuckle * 
3-0 milan , celtic& #39 ; s ¬†european season is over , bad defending again , we need 4 goals .. this is so¬†disappointing and unfair
 getting hammered what a fucking shame
milan is back !!!!!!!!!!
wish i was joking when i say my u15s defend better than this . so so poor . 
celtic are muck üòÇüòÇ
writing milan off wasn't the smartest idea was it . wounded animals and all that .
maybe lenny will make some subs now 
putin celtic
milan finally being milan
celtic üòÇ
celtic are shambles at the back ..
finally , the man himself , balotelli puts one in ! 3-0 milan at celtic park !
mmm so much for my good feeling for tonight . oh well . 
classy finish from balotelli . celtic's unwillingness to spend money has cost them in europe .
milan bringing me excitement again ! lets go !!
hats off to the rossoneri for making celtic park a cauldron of noise . their songs are probably about football too . 
celtic being smacked around here
3-0 against the worst milan side ever , sums up scottish football .. fucked !
ac milan are throttling celtic . mario balotelli gets in on the action with a goal and milan lead 3-0 at celtic park .
celtic really letting the fans down to night 
dortmund score a fantastic 2nd goal , just as milan score a 3rd . lol .
glad to see celtic are getting shited on .
seriously hope people realise how shite celtic actually are by watching this
balotelli it just keeps getting better . finally the proof , if it was needed , just how shite celtic are 
some mongo in my work said celtic would win 2-0 . ' naw doubt about it . easy '
milan champions league is different
lights out for celtic .
celtic seem to be getting their arses handed to them
shocking celtic .
celtic really really pathetic against the worst milan team ever
now milan leads the score 3-0
celtic could be winning 3-0 with the chances they've missed . poor poor finishing
dreadful 
whats celtic score
3-0 milan . celtic a little less than 30 minutes away from being knocked out of europe ( not even in europa) .
sorry but i love milan‚ù§Ô∏èüáÆüáπ‚ù§Ô∏èüáÆüáπ
ac 3-0 up at celtic now .
winning 3-0 over celtic is big .
balotelli is back 3-0 . milan leads 
celtic should be ashamed of themselves tonight , weakest ac milan team i've seen and are being beaten comfortably
shows the difference between this year and last , beat 3-0 off one of the worst milan teams i've ever seen
this is good from milan . where's this been all season ?
this celtic defence is a shambles im going to bed .

" lights out for celtic "
haha , cracking up at celtic .
so much for that celtic will still be in the running to qualify when they get to camp nou idea ....
looks like milan are back on the right track hopefully
celtic's defence must be practicing for a fringe show next year surely ? hilariously bad defending for all three goals .
celtic are shite , hopeless
celtic trying to play a high line against players like balloteli and montelivo is just amateur application of tactics 
this is embarrassing blow the fuckin whistle . celtic's last 2 performances in europe have been nothing short a disgrace .
have milan gotten out of 3rd gear yet
biggest win for milan all season :d 
milan haha 
this is milan 
unlucky celtic

we are celtic supporters faithful through and through üíöüíö
celtic fans still singing well done best supporters ,

gutted celtic will be out of europe . unless samaras steps up to score four . why not ?
w milan !!!!!! 3-0
i've got money on milan 3-0 so that means they'll definitely concede a soft goal now .
celtic are getting their arse handed to them here .
fs celtic üòü
celtic were fucking invincible at home how the fuck can they get fucking torn apart twice in under a fucking year !
ac milan 3-0 up get in !!
watching celtic loose decent
imagine thinking it was actually a good idea to put money on celtic winning 2-1
a night to forget for celtic's centre defence . bordering on abysmal .
guesss wat milan winning 3-0 no one noticing ? no ? ok :(
celtic are so shite and this is proof
fuck sake celtic . this is ridiculous
as poor a night of defending at celtic park in a long time . shambles
think celtic might lose this one ... 
celtic are being outclassed here . so much for that massive home advantage they're supposed to have . milan hardly were in great form either
ac milan showing why scotland are ranked 35th in the world . 
at least celtic arent getting ruined
milan now lead by [ 3 ] against celtic
haha celtic losing 3-0 aww bless
its another one of those special european nights at celtic park ...... oh ... surely the great samaras can single handedly turn this around ?
why the fuck did i choose celtic
60 ' goal ! balotelli . celtic 0-3 milan . 
should have bid on milan and dortmund ! sigh ...
celtic playing well anyway
was fun while it lasted . pull your pants up celtic 
fortress parkhead aye ? ac milan look like they are really bricking it . 
milan is smashing !
i love when celtic get beat , like proper love it .

fucking hell . ian watkins has a better defence than celtic . that's an absolute shambles .
but milan 3-0 üëå
i guess celtic are not unbeatable at home ....
3-0 balotelli certainly finished celtic now
celtic getting a hiding ! 
celtic can easily still win this :)
milan turn on the style on a hapless celtic 
my man mario balotelli getting in on the act for milan got to love him
can milan play celtic every week ? 
where the fuck is the defence ? fs celtic this is embarrassing .
celtics 0 - 3 milan 
even though he's playing against celtic i still love ballotelli what a goal
we're celtic supporters , faithful through and throughüçÄüíö
good move that . shrug off the celtic defender like he‚Äôs not even there .
" you are celtic supporters , shit through and through , you all know in scotland rangers will fuck you "
go on ballotelli lad . ha ha ha , fuck off celtic . also if you want independence , do it sharpish . we'd save billions in england . cheers now
this is embarrassing , the worst milan side i've ever seen
ha ha celtic uz are absolute shite . uz are definitely scotland's shame . total embarrassment
cheer up celtic fans money saved from not being in europe can be spent on the neill lennon fashion range
ac milan are pounding celtic here
oh , boy . celtic are looking pretty bad tonight . they started well , but everything since going behind has been very poor . 
napoli & celtic are in deep shit .
amina wat is dit celtic
goodluck to chelsea ‚ñ™ goodluck to ac milan ‚ñ™ tomorrow - ‚ñ™
boo celtic boo
celtic haven't showed up tonight !
this is the real ac milan !!!
celtic are slumped
ac milan are on this right now !!
shocking defending from celtic , they can't expect to be playing european football after christmas defending like this . 
not surprised milan are 2-0 up . too many celtic fans think their team are unbeatable at home
wtf is this ??? is milan winning a game ????
milan 3 up , dortmund 2 up , cmon chelsea !!
milan really haven't been that good . 2 poorly defended cornere is what's cost celtic . 
who was saying that is a different team when they play at home ? so much for the uefa champions league ...
well my day was going great until 245p !!! 
i think celtic are out if the champions league ...
a milan mauling celtic not good enough at this level . 
missed balotellis goal , only reason i'm watching a celtic game is balotelli
celtic defence is shocking !!!
come on celtic , only need 4 goals to stay in the champions league !
we're boned . gg but come on !!
every team up except a celtic draw , typical 
let's go milan !! üòÅ‚öΩÔ∏è
that's balotelli's first goal in seven matches for ac milan . he did well to hold off the defender and protect the ball before he scored .
keep it up celtic üëå
thought celtic might have had a chance given ac milan's form ... thought they could some how pull it out of the bag like they seem to do
about time celtic got fucked in the champions league , they've scraped it through for so many years and needed a reality check
goal balotelliiiii !!! celtic 0 - 3 milan 
arsenal or celtic match ?
always enjoy celtic getting a good thumping by a team 13th in serie a ,
ref is having a shocker . 
but du milan >>>>>>>
finally milan <3
milan fans feeling champs tonight
ac milan showing why scottland are rank 35th in the world . 
bad boy scored for milan . milan are ranting over celtic now . 0-3 !
3-0 hahahahah !!!! 
och well celtic you haven't done as bad as people would have thought , 2 years in a row in the group stages . fans keep on singing üçÄüíö
goal nr 600 for milan in europe if i'm right ... avanti milan
well , it's been interesting . i'm going to go watch highlights from last year's much more satisfying efforts . this is sickening .
but milan <3
celtic badly need a striker that actually knows how to score goals
can't believe milan haven't won a game away from home all season then they come to celtic park ( usually a fortress ) and run riot . strange .
haven't seen celtic play this bad at home in the cl .
celtic üôàüôäüôäüôä

when was the last time an away team won by a three-goal margin at celtic park ?
celtic are playing well here
unless celtic score 4 goals in half an hour - i'm no winning anything
that's 3-0 for ac milan
i'm watching from the other tv and i think this one works .... celtic 0-3 acmilan . balotelli 59'min . 
it's easy to be the loudest and best fans when ur team is winning but what about when they are losing ? very quiet celtic . come on
im not happy celtic are getting pumped , but scottish football and that but i do like money
this has to be the worst celtic team ever if you don't count tony mowbray's team
someone must have milan 4_0
full time celtic supporter alex williams will be crying in his shack
celtic have been bent over and shagged
when celtic did not invest in much quality to replace hooper and wanyama i pretty much saw this coming . pretty embarrassing .
balotelli . milan just wrapped it up . can't believe i'm saying this but go barca ! 
ac milan leading by 3 goals ... 0-3 * v celtic 
when do celtic turn up at parkhead ??
goaaaal ac milan 0:3 balotile
i expected to beat milan tonight . all we've heard is how poor the italians have been of late .
3-0 milan ... someone is getting a hiding
for fuck sake celtic . you have shit loads of cash so go and spend a bit if you are going to bother to compete in europe .
from the highs of last season to the bitter disgust of this season , how i love celtic football club
meanwhile celtic losing at home 0-3 to milan . so celtic park only rocks when bar√ßa come to town ?
the night celtic had to play well they play the total opposite !
that ac milan must be the aberdeen of italian football surely ? middle of the league team not in celtics league ? bwaaaaaa !; ))
how shit must celtic be if they're getting dicked on by this milan side
i nearly put celtic on my coupon haha !
dang ac milan , where has this been all year ?
fancied celtic to go through to the final 16 too
aye milan winning 3-0
haha celtic are taking it up the arse
" the atmosphere at celtic park was pish . we pumped them silly ." kaka , 26 nov 2013 .
absolute embarrassment at celtic park ! 4 or 5 players don't even want to play !
some noise from the milan fans , i can hear them over the most fantasticist , bestest , uniquest , greatest special fans in the world ! 
4-3-2-1 is really working , milan should stick to it now
looks like game over for celtic .
fucking shite celtic ! hope lawell is happy up there counting his notes rather than spending it on a decent striker an giving us a chance
celtic come on lads !! 
celtic getting absolutely schooled 
balotelli scores after a bit of a drought .. celtic are out of the cl
goal !!! m . balotelli hits celtic hard with ac milan's third for the night .
it's been a while since i put the word " victory " with " milan " in one sentence .
few weeks ago the celtic fans thinking the home game against milan was 3 pts in the bag .... shereen nanjianis 
to be fair though that's the first goal i've had to praise milan , every other goal has been our own fault .
folk seem to forget celtic are still punching massively above there wieght in europe ... we cant afford to keep up with europes elite ! simple !
min 60 ! gol de balotelli , celtic 0 - milan 3 ! 
milan are having a party ! 
mario for milan . its 3-0 now 
no great european night at celtic park then .
celtic have defended like a bunch of amateurs tonight . very poor . 
this is turning into one of the great european nights at celtic park . ( or one of the worst )
very poor from celtic
ac milan were certs tonight and great price is well .. celtic are dung !
milan 3-0 celtics
celtic are getting done over here
man like baloooooo wraps up the game for milan üëèüôå
finally i can watch a game and milan scores
love seeing celtic getting beat , hate them and also neil lennon the cunt !
fuck you celtic . fuck you . 
this is milan !!! real milan !!!
that 3-0 insured allegri a couple of months 
celtic have conceded three very basic goals tonight . two corners with non existent marking and a ball over the top .
fuck off celtic !
mario !!!! 3-0 showin up celtic
fuck the celtic and the ira
milan really needed this . huge huge 3 points for massimiliano allegri and company
things are going down hill for celtic 
milan all over celtic here awful defending
celtic , ye're after letting me down big time .
and goodnight celtic
balotelli anytime/milan win at 4/1 - printing money üí∞üí∞üí∞
this is milan <3
super mario makes it 3 .. milan leads by 3 goals to nil
well at least we know the zombies wont be in to competition for a long long time !! 
balotelli anytime & milan to win 4/1 was a very good bet üòè
on another note ac milan is killing ! üëè
super mario ! balotelli finishes celtic off with a terrific solo goal milan have been ruthless with their finishing tonight 
wow celtic ... ffs !
celtic are getting taught a lesson from the worst ac milan team i've seen !
love seeing the rangers fans commenting on celtic 
will milan's fans be waiting outside parkhead to say thank you to to their players for this game ? 
lennon has done a good job , and i hope he stays , but his hands were tied when the spine of the team was sold . he deserves better . 
celtic lmfao !!
bet under 2.5 bets are coming in tonight . literally no goals around . boring . apart from celtic park of course .
3-0 to milan . at celtic . one of the toughest places to play in all of europe . impressive .
bye bye celtic . 3-0 to milan now through balotelli . bottom spot for celtic this season .
there's celtic cheated again fs
they've taken there chances , celtic haven't , fair play to them !
pub's full of mancs cheering on milan .
not a great night for the celtic defence . great finish though
celtic are getting ripped
celtic are getting spanked
0-3 . mario . cue wee guy shouting at the back " we can still do this celtic . keep the faith . where's me washboard ".
ref's a milan fan ...
celtic don't deserve to be 3 down , but jt looks like they're out now .
always good to see celtic getting thrashed
that's probably that for as go 3-0 up . balotelli runs on to montolivo's fine pass down the centre and scores .
so , so , so embarrassing . ambrose is a fucking bombscare , why is he still in a celtic top ?
celtic summed up . shite !
why did i back celtic to win on both coupons üò†
ffs ! what's goin on ?! c'mon celtic you can do better than this !

this celtic squad is really not good enough
great run , even better ball , strength and a good finish ! supermario ! 3-0 milan .

balotelli scored goal number 3 for milan
aaand ... it's over ... celtic 3-0 down , napoli concede a second and marseille look far from an equaliser , never mind a winner
fuck sake celtic , that's me cutting my study break short , i'd rather cry into a text book than watch the rest of this .
49 ' goal ! and celtic are immediately punished for their profligacy . perhaps the punishment is for their defending .
the european milan is different ?!! 
celtic have been unlucky tonight tbh !

don't even watch a lot football but i hate celtic and detest the caley bastards
goal ! mario balotelli scores to make it 3-0 at celtic park ! 
 wooden spoon for celtic please . the fans can concentrate on their terrorist sectarian banners .
only bad thing abou celtic going out of the champo league is that they have very little distractions from the spfl
milan's last win was on october 19 . their last away win was last season .
the awkward moment when you realize milan might be the only italian team to qualify through the group stages . 
celtic had to be favourites tonight afterall their forwards are so much better than kaka and balotelli
celtic are shite
bsed on their recent form , i was not expecting this from . 3-0 v . 
worst milan team ive seen in years n they have tore us apart , bad days celtic very bad days
jumping on bandwagon , but for me massive errors made by celtic in the summer . poor poor transfer activity .
celtic are getting white washed by milan . üò≠
live champions league matches : 60 min gone goal ! celtic 0-3 milan ( balotelli 60 ' )
celtic shocking tonight
worst performance ive seen in champions league , stats dont lie and accordin to champions league stats celtic keep the least possesion and ...
we go from dominating against barcelona and ajax and milan ! to getting pumped by milan .
hearts being ripped out my arse just like the arse is being ripped out celtic . played so ming ming the night a feel sick
0-3 milan balotelli strides into the penalty area and slots calmly past forster to all but end celtic's ucl campaign for the season 
milan on their worst run in 12 years yet their still pumping us ... not good enough celtic , not good enough !!!!!!!!!
this is painful üôà 
i remember seeing milan throw away a 3-0 lead in europe before .....
celtic now getting humped 3 nil ...

and i thought celtic would do quite well so bought one of their defenders ... üò≠üòÇ

" celtic park " paha nee effect
celtic are not good enough simple as üçÄüçÄüçÄ
nothing better than seeing celtic get hammered !

lol unlucky celtic .
all a can see now i milan players diving all over the place its a fact

this milan hotel bar has the worst lighting ever . dreadful overhead down lights . all their other design efforts utterly wasted as a result .
and that celtic is that 
celtic to loose 3 nil at home to that milan side shows how shite celtic have been . disgrace . fizzing right now
are we the silly ones as fans to expect more from celtic fc ? we have so much money yet we as the fans don't get to see the advantages üò¢

sooo close by celtic !
oh dear getting tanked 
i hope that cunt of a ref , zapata and anyone that has anything to do with ac milan all die .
three very soft goals conceded . celtic not up to par in europe this season , i'm afraid .
goal ! celtic 0-3 milan - balotelli ! maybe he'll get some of that swagger back now . 
dortmund makes it 2-0 from the counter while milan add a third thru balotelli ! 
lol celtic is poo

ac milan is feeling at home in celtic .
big ballotelli makes it 3 for ac milan , celtic are getting destroyed ...
i dont blame anyone except the money men at celtic ... made more money last 4 yrs than ever before yet the team has got worse 
this is what i've been hoping for .. milan is dominating the game , even we're playing in celtic's stadium .
balotelli makes it 3-0 to ac milan at celtic . poor . 
what an embarrassment getting humped off this milan side . our team needs sorting out big time . shite
getting beat 3-0 off an average milan side ... changed days
ac milan showing some good signs in scotland
 ils sont celtic ????? 
milan are back
this celtic team is the most average and boring team i've seen . not one player is good enough to get the fans up of their seats . shocking . üò¥
hahahaha celtic getting dicked
to complete the milan flashback completely all this one needs is a flare and an appearance by dida ...
things may be reverting back to the 90s for scottish football in europe 
bye bye celtic 
love watching celtic get pumped !
absolutly nothing going right for celtic tonight 
if celtic continue to defend like this roll on december 29th !
look at the milan team every single one of them would stroll into the celtic team celtic fans are far too harsh
never mind celtic , i'm sure every team would rather have that " famous " atmosphere than get to the next round ...
forrest nearly exposed milan , just an inch in it
what is wrong with football today :o zil missed a penalty , barca losing 2-1 to ajax , ac milan are 3-0 up against celtic at home
celtic your doing well . would of loved ya to beat milan !
shouldn't be getting fisted by a milan team as bad as this , no excuses
milan are 3-0 up lol
celtic are so poor
celtic being well beaten by a poor milan side . 3-0 down at celtic park .
love it when celtic get gubbed .
milan !! is dealing with celtic
that goal from dortmund was really similar to pavlyuchenko's against inter milan at white hart lane . with reus crossing just like bale .
fuck off celtic aha
gotta feel for celtic
don't know who's better napoli or milan
told daren at uni today celtic would lose 3 0
celtic getting dicked at home , excellent news
celtic , ha .
ac milan leading celtic 0-3 now at parkhead , things not looking good for neil lennon's men , that man mario with the 3rd !
i'm not a fan of this losing at home carry on . not what i'm used to . 
why do they keep going in about celtic's amazing atmosphere . the fans don't score the goals .
balotelli just scored for milan the badmann
well in milan , make it 5 .

aww celtic you make my eyes rain
god damn kidding me ???? celtic looking like complete bitches . 
live champions league matches : 60 min gone goal ! celtic 0-3 milan ( balotelli 60 ' )
what's the name of that song that depeche mode sang and then later by the saturday's? 
it's not celtic's night . several chances that can't be finished . it's even worse that the goals are self-inflicted .
and on another note ! what the fuck has james forrest ever done in a celtic jersey to deserve to be a professional footballer ! 
one more time celtic are shite
when's the candle light vigil mourning the loss of playing football the glasgow celtic way ? 
i can't wait to see crudeli's reaction to the milan result tonight .
i could play better football than celtic tonight ......
unlucky celtic 3-0 ac milan . balotelli
balotelli register his name on the score sheet for ac milan .... celtic 0-3 ac milan
get in celtic getting smashed !!
ah for fuck sake celtic i'm not so proud to be scottish right now 
easy money for me , bet that milan would beat celtic
horrible night for celtic :(
it took ac milan a month and 10 days for a win haha .
shocking from celtic . game totally there for the taking against a very average milan team . gutted .
i knew celtic were pish this season .. but didn't realise we were this bad ! 
great play by ac milan hope they keep this up in there up coming games
i would 3-0 to be a celtic fan
ac milan thou 
no europe after xmas , we will do well to hold on to any player come the january transfer window 
celtic are a festering dog turd of a football team 
so many huns tweeting insults at celtic ... but when you look at rangers as a club in general tho .. shit fans shit team shit finances
that attempt sums up celtic's night , just skims past the outside of the post . 
celtic getting smashed , i like seeing that 
to be honest , both games for ajax and ac milan they have not been brilliant as everyone bums them up to be . its just we're shite ...
samaras to score four 
oh , celtic !!!
can celtic go back to playing in the highlands league now , please ?
between zonal marking and shockingly bad luck , it really hasn't been our night ! 
letting milan drive my car during 4th period 
celtic doing their best to keep neil lennon in glasgow .
y can't milan b this good in league play
forrest shoots narrowly wide while balotelli messes about with his eye . very much a passage of play for the loose cannons 
its no a fucking warm up game celtic for fucksake !!!
is the celtic game finished yet so i can talk to my boyfriend ??? üò¥
mad mario balotelli scores as well . poor , poor showing from celtic . i like .
goal goal goal 4-0 pour milan 
celtic is no match for milan today ! 
gol ! celtic 0-3 milan ( balotelli 60 ) 
i can already hear the celtic fans tomorrow " we played really well " " we didn't deserve to lose " " the referee was shite "
celtic are the most disheartening team to watch .
another sobering night for celtic , but the worst of it is no european football after christmas .
celtic's european dreams are over . :-( 
milan now 3-0 up
this ref has given everything against celtic
another couple from milan would be perfectüëå
 celtic glasgow vs milan ac 
i really do hate celtic .

celtic just never replaced 3 stars from last season own fault
unlucky night for 
how close are celtic going to get ! just not our night
fuck celtic . january window better be used wisely .
ac milan killing celtic atm
celtic have only themselves to blame . that and zonal marking . and james forrest . and derk boerrigter . 
the worst milan team for many a year are caning celtic at home . nl's time as celtic manager is nearing the end game .
at the moment , milan might be the only italian team to go through to the last 16 of ucl .
i wasn't lying when i said celtic are milan's bitches tonight
bad night for celtic
that's celtic's night over and that's me done watching that game . * switching to arsenal match *
bye bye celtic 
a team who cannot buy a result come to for an easy win .
 : milan 3 celtic 0
rangers fans laughing at celtic is just funny haha away get a buzz off beating arbroath haha
celtic having no luck tonight at all , with that shot from forrest just then üò£üò£
the awkward moment when you realize milan might be the only italian team to qualify through the group stages . 
shower of fucking charlatans celtic
celtic are definitely a top european side 
ac milan are serious ! 3-0
dortmund wants to leave group stage okay üëå and ac milan raping celtic lol
bye bye - out of europe 
celtic are playing well but own fault for the goals and not taking the chances is why celtic are losing 
fuck does celtic ever know how to bottle it at home vs italian opposition . 
we knew it was going to be a tough road through this group . we were right . 
celtic are getting shagged
 win out . win coupon up . tricky
3-0 milan is strong 
love when celtic get best at parkhead
celtic are shite .
look at them trying kick them up and down the pitch what happened to playing the celtic way ?
fuck this i'm going back to my xbox . piss poor from celtic .
i hate this ref he is so one sided 
don't mind celtic but when they play in the cl it puts into perspective how shit the scottish league is . no competition for them .
celtic are getting heavy pumped üòÇ
cant remember the last ac milan scored 3 goals ..
celtic fans , its a shit provincal shoestring side of rejects against the richest teams in europe . what the fuck did you think would happen ?
ac milan is on top form tonight
unlucky celtic 
happy milan are beating celtic .
the tale tonight for celtic is the same as the game in milan : don't give away cheap goals and take your chances when they come 
there is literally no point of celtic even being in the champions league
quickfire goals from milan ... that should keep allegri in his job !! at least for now 
worst defensive performance from celtic , even worse attacking display from samaras .
and celtic fans said they'd get through the group üòÇ
celtic are a fucking shambles at the back ! something i've no said much this season ! defo need to start man marking in the champions league !!
it's over for celtic .. forza milan ..
fuck sake celtic !!!!!!
celtic need to get there act together down 3-0 fuck sake !!
lol celtic üòÇüòÇ
mon perterbough and chelsea ... milan arsenal up
can u hear celtic sing ....... :)
looks like milan missed the memo about being intimidated the atmosphere at celtic park
celtic cbs have thrown this away tonight . van djik should step up in the future but does ambrose deserve another chance to ?
milan 3-0 up against glasgow blind school . must be bad to concede 3 against this milan !
on the plus side celtic are losing
celtic r showing why they have 2 qualify with the other also rans in europe 
celtic might as well give up man
we're bullying celtic on their home turf and i'm loving every second of it . 0-3 .
no hope at all for us , if we cant beat a milan side on a poor run what hope do we have against barca
chance for celtic as lustig's ball runs all the way through to james forrest , who prods just wide of the post . 
yellow card for celtic center back
celtic - pub league should not be allowed in champions league 
max just cemented his position on the milan bench
they can make you or break you ! but we will always love them 
forrest stock his neck on the line for celtic there 
ha fuck off celtic you scummy cunts !
go on milan , shove it right up the irish bastards
dont watch much of celtic but van dijk & ambrose are absolutely atrocious ! hope they are still at celtic in a couple of years .
oh celtic we hate you
bwave . vewy bwave . bwave pro terrorist banner and bwave display on the park . 
forrest skims the back post , but it's still celtic 0-3 milan 
this celtic result shouldn't be a shock , they're a very average side in european terms .
and some people thought celtic stood a chance in this group
fucking love seeing celtic getting pumped at the piggery
celtic are utter shite !! absolute shite !
7 time champions league winners ac milan never had a chance in going to the fortress that is celtic park
celtic 5 chances no goals ac 3 chances 3 goals 
is this celtic's biggest champions league home defeat(group stages) ?
goal !!! m . balotelli hits celtic hard with ac milan's third for the night .
apart from celtic fans of course does anyone actually like them ..
really not happening for celtic tonight , 3-0 vastly unfair on them . really similar to their defeat v juventus last year .
lets hope celtic dont get thumped , cause that would just be ashame .. hahaha
celtic could be playing to an emtpy park and still not find the back of the net !
actually cant describe how embarrassing this is , milan are 13th in serie a , haven't won in 7 & haven't won away this season
celtic getting absolutely fucked by possibly the worst ac milan team in history . says it all about scottish football .
typical from celtic man , we need sort at team out drop the passengers and spend fucking money getting players in !!
let's all laugh at 
whats going on at celtic park ?!
thought celtic are ' unbeatable ' at home
celtic think they're so good until the play someone outside the scottish league
goooooaaal ! celtic glasgow vs . ac mailand . livescore 0-3 
65 minutes in and still no striker on the pitch and they question why celtic don't score
celtic getting well and trulely smashed ! 
celtic 0 balance sheet 3 . hope you're happy lawwell . this is what happens when we rake in 30m in cl fees and transfers and don't spend
ffs celtic
any1 else thinking ac milan have had the ref bribe cheque book out again dinnae get me wrong they're deservedly winning but celts r gtn nowt
well the big blooter seems to work for ac milan , stealing our main tactic !
sky sport's parochialism knows no bounds . they seem amazed that the mighty celtic are 0-3 down to some team from northern italy ...
nothing better than seeing celtic getting hammered
does it get more pleasing than celtic getting battered at home !
i had celtic milan to draw . bugger .
 solid tonight .... after 7 matches without a single win ..... come on dommy ...
celtic had no chance whatsoever in their cl group despite what their deluded fans thought
lol at celtic
credit to milan for tonight's performance but this victory doesn't paper all the rossoneris crack
have turned celtic game off . too much like watching lanark - promising , miss some good chances and lose stupid goals 
celtic are shocking at corner kicks , both defending them and scoring from them . poor coaching !!
far too easy for milan here 
there's a hell of a lot of bloody diving and acting by ac milan tonight !! but sure whats fecking new there !
met today with journalists in to talk . looking forward to tomorrow's session in 
but de balotelli . milan 3-0 celtic 
why can't milan play this well in the serie a too ?
fuck celtic :-/
celtic has had no luck
poor goals , poor defence , poor team and awful manager . celtic just utter pish ! 
lenny plays 4-2-4 against italians in the cl . honestly . a bad night for .
2m afff afff afff 59 balotelli makes it 3-0 . the italian striker holds off ambrose and then finishes into the far corner . w milan
bet the celtic fans stuck in jail are glad they're no watching the game ! hahaha
fair enough gettin beat from munich , barcelona or madrid 3-0 at home ... not fuckin ac milan !!
and this is why you shouldn't use zonal marking ! 
caaaannnnyyyy believe milan were 6/4 and i only backed them in a shitey 6fold thats turned out shitey
van dijk scores that volley and celtic would have won
davie provan sky lackie !...... fuck calming down get fuckin stuck in celtic get the fire in the belly
supporting celtic's champions league campaign is the most stressful part of my life
ac milan winning 3-0 " unbelievable "
take a dive celtic thats one of the most awful displays i have seen in a long long time . some of these players should never be wearing hoops
and i thought this would be a tough game . celtic are pathetic ! 
when you sell your best players and fail to replace them , this is what happens . 
kinda deserve to lose . horrendous from celtic like
that famous ' parkhead atmosphere ' has done wonders for celtic tonight .
milan 3 now ...
just like james forrest in a nightclub , celtic have exposed themselves at the back tonight .
shocking defending from celtic , they can't expect to be playing european football after christmas defending like this . 
celtic are just too poor tonight !
mxm celtic are just being sour now . van dijk tryning to kill a man here
and you'll never walk alone ! walk on through the wind , walk on through the rain ! 
weak as fuck celtic
poor poor celtic wot ya gonna do if u cant score the goals to get through ....
it's pointless going to celtic games . they can only go so far until they get battered . at least they get somewhere unlike scotland .
i laugh at celtic because i fucking hate them , nothing to do with winning or losing
hate when part time rangers fans that are only interested when celtic are getting beat 
are milan players actually playing with passion ? don't wake me up please
to easy for ac milan celtic are pish
lol celtic !!
genuinely dont like ballotelli . or ac milan . or italians . or anyone at this moment in time . 
milan fans are cute , nobody can believe they're actually winning
milan to win at celtic was buying money at 13/10 
looks like celtic park is not the fortress it once was . 
detroit tigers suck !!! 
celtic is out . see them losing at home .
great to see balotelli so happy after scoring the goal ! hope to always see him happy and scoring goals at milan ! üòç
but ! 60 ' : celtic glasgow 0-3 milan ac ! 
looks like ac milan are having a fiesta or wherever it is italians do
horrible from celtic , gees wanyama back
what makes it even more worse is that milan aren't even a good team anymore . this is just a mixture of bad luck and terrible defending .
lol i bet celtic wished their fans were like dortmund's
the awkward moment when you realize milan might be the only italian team to qualify through the group stages .
so glad celtic are out . just proves how shit scottish football actually is
celtic have been dire in the champions league this season . we can't play without broony , and we need a centre forward who can actually score
no crumb of comfort for celtic tonight :(
lol @ celtic
poor celtic yes next year ya'll will get em
 aren't usually rolled over as easy as that at home in the cl . disappointing
this is a bad milan team tae
milan winning comfortably at park fuck yeah !
balotelli scores for milan !
james forrest exposed the milan defence there like he exposed his dick in elliots
celtic r woeful such a waste of a champs league place should give the extra one to the uk imo
milan are 3-0 up can you believe it !!
milan 6/4 some bet !!! jus need other teams to come up now !
okay i'm glad i'm at work and can't watch this atrocity . holy shot ac milan is gutting the bhoys
nothing better than celtic getting humped by the italians . 
milan are killing celtic
a collective coupon pumping by the look of it the night , why oh why did i take celtic : l
i thought this was a must win game for celtic . oh well never mind 
celtic are playing well 
celtic are getting it !
what's the celtic score .......?
it could be worse celtic , we could be rangers right about now .
il go for 5-0 milan
celtic getting humped a day early :p
celtic are so fucking frustrating to watch !!!!!!!!!
no fight , no balls , worst celtic team i have seen in years !!
really need basle , chelsea & celtic to score . 
poor celtic . milan are having fun !
that forrest miss really sums up celtic's match ... that and the poor defending that led to 3 avoidable goals .
just realised one player's shirt has no sponsor printed . that player is a muslim . 
celtic defending is an embarrassment .... zonal marking in champions league ... ur having a laugh ...
first away victory for milan since may so so happy :-) :-) :-)
milan are terrible ! a terrible team destroying us at celtic park . trying to compete in europe without spending reflects our lack of ambition
would like it if ac milan would stop scoring now haha !!
ac milan can fuck off‚úäüí¶üí¶üí¶
a shite ac milan team proving just how bad scottish football is . 
celtic have nothing up front at this level .. zero . & when you make mistakes they've made at the back you get punished by quality
shame for celtic ............. not üëä
celtic , look on the bright side . the balance sheet looks good !!!!!!!!! take the laces from my shoes . who's got the rope ?
funny feeling hearts will beat celtic this saturday too . celtic fans need to wake up to neil lennon .
the celtic team going on a wee " goal strike " tonight ? 
no even going to say anything about celtic tonight all they will come out with is " least were in the champions league "
surrender monkeys get the fuck out of parkhead and stay out yer no wanted here 
forza milan 3-0 and easy .
finally balloteli scores and its 0-3 at celtic park
how bitter do celtic fans get when they are losing hahaha
celtic have been poor all season for me . no consistency whatsoever and last minute wins are not good enough . simple as .
good to see the toms holding there own to nite against a poor milan side üòÇ
celtic are a pub team
good night celtic 
buuuuuut balotelli ! celtic 0-3 milan ac ! 
watching milan-celtic with load of ac fans . credit to balotelli . could easily have gone down for a pen but stayed on his feet to make it 3-0
pleasing night all round ; celtic getting humped and dortmund winning 
y gol y goll de mario balotelli 3x0 
never in a million years did i think we'd get pumped of milan tonight . 
haha fuck you commons are shit
celtic can we just get all the excuses just now so we dont need to hear them later ?
ac milan is answering all the critics
woooooow milan is actually fucking winning a game !!! wooow fuck yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it looks like the only time milan can escape the slaughter from media/fans , is when they play cl-games .
is this ref on fucking drugs ? fair play to celtic for keeping playing üçÄ
celtic are so unlucky it's hard to watch
next life i'll be an ac milan fan .
cmon barca gana ajax pa milan qualify ugghhh
we're the famous glasgow celtic and we're absolutely shite
scratch that ... milan it is
celtic pushed the self destruct button as soon as they planned to go with zonal marking
correct me if i'm wrong but is this celtic team about to deliver our worst home defeat in the champions league ? like i said , imposters .
haha 2-0 great night ! arsenal winning celtic getting beat ! üòç‚öΩ
celtic is pooey i want im a celeb

forrest fails in his attempt to force himself through milan's defence to try and squeeze a ball in .

milan killing celtic 3-0

i know its bad but i love watching celtic get pumped
celtic banners are full of scum
celtic are , like the ireland national team , a nearly team , constant hard luck stories , they're getting old .. 
this is an ac milan team on there worst form for years as well oh dear
john collins good job milan have weaknesses . what do celtic have oh yes a bad manager . not good enough to manage pub team
how's ac milan beating any professional football club by 3 goals away from home Óêç
also , celtic couldn't have asked for a better time to face ac than tonight . has it been an underwhelming performance from them ?
swear to fuck man celtic depress the life out me
just start snapping legs celtic
i've got milan down for 4-1 cmon
how utterly rubbish are celtic when this milan squad are pumpin ' them 3-nil away from home ?
celtic getting pumped as normal celtic 0-3 ac milan hehe
don't think my heart could have taken following this celtic game on tv ...
drake supports milan , just because balotelli plays with them i reckon . used to be a city supporter for that reason
this is bloody shocking celtic
 0-2 fallo su 
celtic down 3-0 so decide to slate rangers ? marioooooo‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
worst thing is ac milan dont look a good team , like barca were
celtic are getting pumped 
if 's defense moved any slower it would suffer from rigor mortis ... 
celtic can now start to get ready for the election scotland for the scots .
milan a different team in the champions league ! doing very well !!! 
ajax and milan winning in europe makes me happy . 
worst milan team in about 20 year , we are fuckin hopeless
wow celtic are soooooo shit üò§
you know it's game over when everyone sings we are celtic supporters üòÇ ...
thank fuck i went to training instead of watching the celtic game 
you're all being hardon james forrest tonight 
we were always going to get wrecked in a fast , open game . that's when class comes through . milan have been far better . need to invest .
tht performance is disgusting ! not the celtic way
don't care if we are 3 down to milan i'm still gonna watch my team .
celtic found out . eircom league standard side with battling qualities .
2-0 milan !!! another tip looks to have won at nice odds ! close to 100% tonight now
horendous milan team pumping celtic haaaaaaaaaaa
if matri comes on and scores and milan win 4-0 then milan need a drugs test
celtic badly miss wanyama and hooper
good to see celtic getting dicked on tonight
also 0:3 in glasgow ... yes ! ( more goals please milan) . 
milan in ucl . aren't milan in serie a . fact
looks like if we hold on we could be going to the last 16 come on ! score or hold on . looks like celtic going out
this could get embarrassing for celtic ...
ac milan are pish as well hahahaha
celtic is so bad even balotelli can score vs them .
celtic 0 - worst milan ever 3 . 
i thot celtic wuda put up some sort of fight tonight sayin there at home and it's a must win . last time they'll be in my bet 
yoooh a.c. milan is murdering celtic
this celtic game pretty much sums up my support of any professional sports team ever . fucking pathetic .
yet again celtic were better throughout the night , just can't take the opportunities
james forrest isn't worthy of wearing a celtic jersey
the awkward moment when you realize milan might be the only italian team to qualify through the group stages ..
celtic are fucking terrible aha
i don't think celtic are going to win this game
is it just me or is the just totally boring 2night ? 
celtic 3 down at home , the kind of mauling you usually only expect when we're on our travels . 
fuck sake celtic
milan should bring ronaldinho on for the last ten he will rip it up !
celts look totally lost , no motivation , lennon has to b blamed , hes a good celtic man but a dreadful manager
nice to see milan do well .
just another 1 of those celtic champions league nights
never want to see james forrest in a celtic shirt again , absolutely woeful every time he plays .
mario balotelli has scored for milan and it's 3-0
love when celtic get beat looool
we are a.c. milan bitch . omg guys lets go
celtic showing what they are .... a very average side out of their depth at champions league level .
not watching it but it seems celtic getting slapped aboot by milan ac .
celtic are shockingly poor lol
milan dominating celtic 
wait but celtic hardly get thrashed at home .
celtic gettin ' hammered at home lol
sadly lacking quality ! quite possibly the weakest centre half at celtic park since raphael schiett 
diane is raging , not my fault celtic are disgusting . gullible thinking you would win mum .
we have a looser mentality celtic . always a hard luck story . this is down to lennon and lawwell .
here comes anthony stokes . milan are fucked now . 
this what's called milan‚ù§Ô∏è
now wassup ?
celtic is not shite .. pipe down people . is a great team . but da group was too strong is just imposible to deal with 2 , 3 big dawgs at a time 
anyone know why some of the celtic players don't have the sponsor on the front ??
my earlier prediction designed to jinx it for celtic , is working perfectly !

celtic will be like cliftonville in a couple of years because of the spl
bed time ... i'd defend those corners better than the entire celtic defence . i'm 5 " 7 .
milan owns a thankyou to real peoplee
hope celtic aren't getting beat because i'll have to go home to kevin and my grandad raging üò§üò¥ silly celtic fans
milan 3 up against celtic and barcelona losing 2-1 to ajax
is that 3-0 milan yes it is boy the samaritans are going to be working overtime tonight dealing with the suicidal celshit fans 
oh well goodbye to europe for celtic this season .
get that right round you ! you ginger prick ! mon the milan
ac milan aren't even great celtic are just pish
gonni watch i'm a celeb cos this team is up there way the worst ever in the world poor in defence midfield and up front 
fs celtic
utterly woeful & predictable celtic
genuinely sad to see celtic go . no scottish teams in europe is shite .
forget the premiership , celtic would struggle in the championship 
fuck sake celticüò†
got a bet with the scottish celtic fan at work that ac milan will win ! looks like i'm getting a non-stop supply of teaüëç‚òïÔ∏è
fuck off milan trying to get iza a yellow .
celtic just aren't good enough for this level
lennon must be sacked shoicking show by celtic
super mario just toying with the celtic defense .
really hope celtic score ! don't even like football but hate cunts rubbin it in ‚úã
celtic are shite
yes yes go go milan go milan !!! 2-0
best thing he has done in a celtic shirt !
how can you call celtic shit ? ac milan are one of europe's biggest clubs , might not be the best ever but ac milan are never bad . 
oh well celtic are out 
milan have been ruthless without being brilliant tonight . the difference between trying hard to be good , and doing what comes naturally
celtic park is rocking 
the celtic fans who left before the game waa over , fuckin ridiculous . you stay no matter the fucking score .
milan haven't won in previous 7 games ...
this is very embarrassing result from 1of the worst ac milan teams in years . lennon go to fuck
there is no way celtic are finishing with 11 men ...
3-0 pour milan >>>>>>>>>
nothing is going right for celtic tonight & their defence has been shocking , they have given this game away .
feeling shrewd after backing celtic draw no bet at 6/5 . football betting is becoming my tax deduction .
what a terrible tackle from behind to balo from a celtic player , fuck off u shitty scotish player
ac milan doing to celtic exactly the same as what the dutch police did to them .....
milan cruising now‚Ä¶hopefully this result provides the team a boost heading into the weekend ! 
good bye celtic for another year but don't worry you will have another free pass next year .
 and both leading 2-0 , well done ! 0-2 behind unfortunately ... and losing but that's clear . 
that gulf in class now seems to be the size of the gulf of mexico 
dortmund have doubled d lead over napoli and jack wilchere gets his brace and it's 2-0 over marseille and ac milan are 3-0 over celtic . 
rangers fans are embarrassing suddenly you's are ac milan fans üòÇ
wat a way to bounce back milan ... forza rossoneri
its not zonal marking that is the problem , its that the celtic defenders didn't do it properly . 
" we are celtic supporters faithful through and though ". at least were in europe hail
the celtic defence are playing magic tonight btwüòÇüé£
celtic getting obliterated in europe again . youd need a heart of stone not to laugh .
now , milan will be feeling like super dele !
haha celtic are getting shat on
celtic men should tune in to itv and watch a real team !! 
bye bye celtic üòÇüòÇ
mind the celtic fans who said 3 easy home winsÓêí
celtic aren't making things any easier for them selves tonight ...
oh dear , celtic ...
imagine if celtic go to nou camp and beat barca now .
sorry celtic but the chase is on 
aww no celtic are losing their discipline ... shame . hope their all hurtin
both times i've turned celtic on rather than arsenal they've fucking scored .
how ironic is it that juve and napoli could crash out of cl in the group and milan , of all teams , would go through !
milan , dortmund and arsenal are doing work
keep flicking between arsenal and celtic and i've missed every goal fs
gerard butler was more of a threat when he wore the hoops than boerrigter ! 
nice one celtic , useless mongs
that should have been a straight red . 
jack 2 - 0 celtic 
celtic are atrocious tonight ! 
celtic milan , boys against men ( even if they are slightly poncey italian men !! )
why are celtic fans slagging rangers cause they are getting put out europe ?
unlucky celtic üëã
we are milan
just enjoying watching milan demolish celtic 
no way back for celtic now , ac milan never throw away a 3-0 lead ...
lustig always seem to hit the first milan player with his crosses , even when there's no milan player around . it's actually quite impressive .
awful from celtic . found out big time .
such a dirty challenge by the celtic defender . very lucky that it was only a yellow .
how the fuck is that a yellow ?? celtic are horrendous
celtic is so sloppy ..
this is the milan everyone is used to seeing .
ac milan might not be going well in serie a , europe is another story . something juve , napoli inter can only dream of . 
had a feeling milan would turn up
this celtic ref is a joke and so are the commentators hahahahah
shocking from 
milan are fucking honkin tae . shows how bad scottish football is .
if celtic got through everyone'd call it a miracle . it'd be more like when the scummy guy is the dad on jezza and a nice guy is devoed .
ac millan steadily trashing celtic oo
celtic are hackersss
when celtic get players capable of competing at champions league level they might look like they should be there .
been honest celtic was always in the game just didn't take there chances !
bye bye celtic
damn i cant believe this but it seems the old ac milan is back ! 
balotelli scores the third for milan , wilshere scores his second for arsenal ‚öΩüëåüëç
this is pish to watch milan aren't even that good
meanwhile in glasgow , it goes from bad to worse for celtic as mario balotelli has scored a third for milan on the night 
aah questo milan üî¥‚ö´Ô∏è
celtic's champions league ended with brown's stupidity against barcelona & when the defence decided not to turn up tonight 
" the atmosphere and fans at celtic is so so special until they start getting pumped dry by the opposition . so special " - cesare maldini ‚ù§Ô∏è
who are celtic to blame tonight ? nae their fault !
65 second celtic change - stokes replaces commons
maybe celtic fans might take there head out their arse now
the referee in the celtic vs milan game is absolutely fantastic 
how many ac milan players never made the start tonight 5 or 6
celtic can suck a dick
celtic getting beat , lol
fs celtic ! üëä
shame celtic have been found wanting again ! poor for scottish football 
fuck off celtic . your already out . no need for that cheap disgraceful tackle
celtic are just qoin ome !! outta ucl
once again , poor defending from celtic 
lucky that was just a yellow celtic ..
make milan reserve some goals for catania oo
celtic heads have gone . awful tackle . if that was mario ...
hope milan win 4-0
curva sud after every game protest against milan , please . it really helps . :d
supermario just trolled celtic guys : " this is the end ... of celtic "
the scary thing about this is that milan are utter shite
fuck me , celtic are pish min ! best thing for us gettin put out o europe , fuckin embarrassing .
goodnight celtic 
barcelona are now motivated , they know milan got the win . operation eliminate milan is over . very sad .
lennon said a lot of bullcrap in his press conference . spoke alot about milan dan his own team . why wont dey flog him ?
good night celtic haha
celtic are rotten put a fucking half decent team in instead of they faggots
celtic ate playing pish !!!!!
said at weekend all stuff about milan being pish , clearly reality hadn't registered about how average we are . good in spfl yes , but europe no
just came back to see arsenal score their second :d ! celtic though :/
ment that as in fuck what's happening to celtic ...
not celtic's year , the team needs serious work .
am in shock at the celtic result tbh
celtic proving once again that you need a lot more than a crowd of loud , passionate fans to win a football match .
milan just spanking celtic 3-0
tony stokes ? this is milan neil , not kilmarnock .
always a back to the wall group but some goals conceded by celtic was schoolboy stuff , dont get away with that playing against the big boys !
sub celtic : stokes is on for commons . 65 ' 
gotta get myself another milan jersey !
this the real ac <3 .
celtic taking there beating well ... kick lumps out of milan lol
3 nil to milan lol lol lol 
campaign was over when our " captain " got sent off against barca . embarrassing celtic . players need to have a long hard look at themselves .
celtic simply haven't replaced hooper and wanyama . doesn't tell in the league but glaringly obvious at this level .
3-0 milan 
celtic should be down a man . izaguire absolutely chops down balotelli .
celtic are scum
poorest milan team in a long time , haven't won in 5 games , 3-0 down to them at home . cany believe that
uses zonal marking in europa league - atletico group - humped sidewards ! use it against a mediocre milan side - same outcome 
maybe it's starting with balotelli that makes a world of difference ! perhaps barcelona would have lost then ? 
milan again !!!!
milan players asking for a red card wen there 3 -0 up what cocks !! 
celtic have been missing a playmaker for years
lol celtic
liverpool were 3 nil down at one point against milan . 
but celtic shock me o !
coupon is burst and celtic are getting pumped 
well celtic are out then arlass on them likeee
celtic are such a scummy club .
kaka scored , balotelli scored , ac milan wins . now , can barcelona please pull through so i can go on with my day ? üôè
ac milan is playing so nice right now üëå good job boys
ion , ac milan is on fire !!!!
0-3 at home to an average milan side , you can't compete in europe if you don't spend money . shocking result .
milan is playing so good .
celtic coulda done with a player like gauld the night üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ giruy
aye cause celtic were going to beat milan anyway !
cult hero samaras nowhere to be seen . why do celtic fans make him out to be class ? nonsense .
why have milan only got 3 players in the box
given their pre-match display in support of a rotting terrorist , it's a little ironic this celtic team appear to lack hunger .
celtic , no defense , no midfield , no strikers , no nothing ! so bad ! refs been shite but its no his fault we are getting pumped
draw was a bit ambitious for the acca 
bye bye celtic
goal ! goal ! goal ! balotelli !!! celtic 0 - 3 milan 
it's results like this that prove so vividly in an age of no domestic competition just how far backwards this celtic side has gone .
ac milan smashing celtic 3-0 ! stay focus till it is definitely over remains a priority ... 
just put the celtic game on and it‚Äôs 3-0 now‚Ä¶ has it been that bad ? 
celtic are a shambles . lennon again proves he's tactically inept and get's team selection badly wrong against a poor milan side 
mario balotelli scored milan's third in glasgow against celtic . why always him ? elsewhere the highbury cokehead doubles arsenal's advantage .
but milan r beautiful @ times .... now , to the league
the only way milan will qualify for the cl next season is if they win the tournament this year . celtic will probably be there no problem
why is milan so good tonight ?
65 ' izaguirre ( celtic ) is booked ! racking up the yellows !
 we dont have focus up front so teams aren't scared of us milan have had more freedom to play than they could have hoped for .
timeline awash with negativity on zonal marking . which has to mean celtic are getting humped 
this is milan playing defense , on the road !! 1 has to go in !!
the milan song at the moment is a banger ! germans sing it as well
has neil lennon taken as far as he can ? 
it is a bad night for celtic but two good goals by ac milan
another ' famous ' night at celtic park .
never thought i'd say this but celtic do need brown's attitude on that park tonight 
people actually thought celtic weren't gonna finish bottom ?
3-nil ?? is this the genoa-game that turns milan's season on its head ? i really hope it is !!! 
someone tell charlie mulgrew that celtic are playing in green and white .
super mario ''' milan have been terrible this season anawl but celtc are even worse lol
milan 3-0 celtics
dortmund have another and lead 2-0 ac milan lead 3-0
dont worry , stokes is on , 4-3 win for celtic .... lol
barcelona aren't having a good night - celtic down to ac milan too . 
ac milan is coming to get ya‚Äòll fake ass club !!! ahahahahahahhah 0-3 milan
milan going ham
no celticüòë
stokes on commons off 65 mins 
commons off , stokes on .... 65 mins gone . commons had a very poor game ... doesn't look especially fit to me .. 3-0 acm lead
wow celtic are awful
0vsacmilan3 the only attractive thing about this celtic team is their hairstyle
i love celtic , but this is a defensive shambles .
well celtic are getting destroyed
what has happened to celtic üò≥üò°üòï 
milan frappe 3-0 celtic
" celtic are about to bring anthony stokes on " i can imagine milan are bricking it now
we are celtic supporters , faithful through and through ,
again , celtic player , emilio has been yellow carded for his tackling from behind to ballotelli 0-3
celtic are defending like mr whitmores team tonight
celtic fans display a bobby sands flag .... now there getting hammered .... fucking good
hate to say it but unfortunately i can't watch anymore of this celtic game ! ah well
had to turn the celtic game off . embarrassingly bad
izaguirre should have just seen a straight red . typical dirty celtic hack .
celtic is getting it
i think it's safe to say , celtic guilty of criminal defending tonight , 3 of the softest goals you will ever see . pathetic .
this milan team is poor eh ?
clive tyldsley quipped earlier that arsenal were trying to win the toughest champions league group . i think celtic would beg to differ .
thoroughly enjoy hearing celtic are having a mare , can't stand that ginger clown lennon 
what a 48hrs of sport . villa win 2-2 , birmingham fuckin bears and celtic get battered . i'm a jinx .
celtic never stop singing though great fans
at least milan and arsenal are winning
ac milan smashing celtic 
that celtic player is lucky to only get yellow for that !
67 in the heat is lisbon the fans they came in thousands to see the boys become champions ! 
acm- check . arsenal-check . chelsea-*scratches head *
celtic cannot defend
celtic now 3-0 down to ac milan . and celtic are the better side
3-0 down so celtic bring on anthony stokes üòÇüòÇ
emilio doesn't want to play barca ! no wonder as he canny handle an amateur mob fae milan - quite deliberate that was
celtic kany defend n kany take there chances , no a good combination at this level am afraid !
dortmund , arsenal and milan with d goals !!!
loving seeing celtic crash out . team taking after its manager now . we are losing so we will try and kick everyone on the pitch .
milan woeful all season showing up celtic here big time
now my team is pish so feel free to tell me to mind my own business but i've said for long time celtic would be better if they had a manager
milan must be so intimidated play at celtic park eh
unreal how badly celtic miss wanyama and hooper ...
and somewhere in scotland celtic is getting it
celtic showing how not to defend . there's zonal then there is standing in a space doing nothing ! even the 3rd is a straight ball & run !
bad news for ajax , milan is leading celtic 2-0
quick lennon . ring rafa and he‚Äôll tell u how to get 3 back against milan . 05 
this is getting ridiculous now . celtic butchering down balo every time he gets the ball . 
in 2 years time celtic will be back in the shadow of the ibrox
win , lose or draw always celtic üçÄ
and i never had faith in ac milan ffs
it's times like this the celtic support need to stay to the end , sing and keep the morale going in my opinion rather than leave üëç ‚öΩÔ∏è
c'mon milan 2 more will do !!
theres nae point in celtic even playing the next 25 minutes . should just take them all off .
milan's for sure gonna screenshot that
we never have any luck against milan .
need ajax to hang on a chelsea goal and a shalke goal . and milan to hang on biting my nails watching that game 
ac milan 3 goals up against celtic ... finally balotelli scores !
cunts want a reality check , its ac milan we are playing , punched above our weight last season in cl , ok milan have had a poor season ..
and the celtic haters come out !
you're proud of your fans ? remember back to remembrance day in 2009 when celtic played falkirk and youse sung through a minute silence , scum
anyone fancy hearts to beat celtic on sunday ?
some celtic fans need to realise we haven't a strong side like last season , might be good in the spl certainly not in cl
last few years and next few years celtic are the only scottish team doing scotland justice in europe , celtic keep scottish football running !
are celtic unable to win because ac milan are being too physical at corners ? hehe
at work today i said that milan would win 3-0
at least milan r slapping the crap outta stupid celtic ! i can't stand celtic they don't deserve to even be in europa league competition imo !
celtic ur daen well üòÇüòÇüòÇ ...... pause .... not
see you later celtic boy
good to see celtic getting pumped tonight ! keeps the fans quiet for a while 
celtic really do my head right in defending like that !! a mean come on to fuck ! not even a out and out striker on until 65 mins
hahahaha celtic get it right up yous so much for making the last 16 been showed up to be fukin pish 
just shows how bad scottish football is when the worst milan side of the last 20 years are beating them 3 nil at home 
to sum it up . celtic bought pish . wasted millions of pounds an now forster and ledley will leave . you all know that dont you
absolute garbage tonight !! get grip celtic . 
goooal ! celtic 0 - 3 ac milan
celtic lack so much quality it's unreal .
indeed : the awkward moment when you realize milan might be the only italian team to qualify through the group stages . "
if you need to end a terrible run , play celtic .
celticüôàüòÇ
come on milan lets get ahead of barca in group h !
i'd love to be in paradise right now !! fuck the score ... fuck milan !! it's the champions league and it's ma team !! üíö 
get in milan , embarrassing celtic at home ! lovely job !!! 
milan are going in 3-0 against celtic what channels that on rather watch that game
celtic should be down a man . izaguirre absolutely chops down balotelli from behind . needless .
mommy ... 3-0 
thank you mario . fucking hate celtic me
this referee is more of a child minder . hope there's enough elastoplast to go round the milan boys .
last time i watched celtic on tv arthur boruc was their keeper
chelsea game is murder , might switch over to see this milan team who are struggling to win games recently 
shameful from and lennon's team selection is again suspect . i wish we had a manager who had a style of play or philosophy .
dno whos playing at parkhead but its defo no celtic
everyone needs to relax about celtic man , it's no the because the spfl , fans pay and did see new quality impact signings come in 
the referee has put celtic out the champions league , nothing more they could do . wait for neil lennon to say those words 
acm !! keep going =d
nothing i enjoy more on a cold tuesday night than to know celtic are getting pumped out of europe
celtic are the laughin stock of european footy 
wonder how the self appointed best fans in the world are supporting their team tonight ? worst milan team in history and they're 3-0 up
getting beat easy by a shite team is one of the most frustrating things 
i guess this is the time where celtic just starts yelling , zio zio
suppose celtic losing good for other spl clubs as it reduces celtics revenue and therefore the financial gap
come on celtic !!
sorry but ac milan is just proving how shite the scottish league is
milan aew 3 up vs celtic
och well . i actually hate it when celtic win . or score . or play in european competitions .
do fans have any heroes who are still on this side of the topsoil ?
milan in ucl like a lion -_-
so much respect for them fans singing away , i love glasgow celtic !
made to look like school boys . knew it was over it half time but you no even more when we start singing we are celtic supporters
watching supernatural with celtic . üê∂ + üëª = üëå
goolll balotelli * celtic 0-3 milan 
milan is on a cruise
always laugh when i see rangers fans mocking celtic when they lose in the champions league
correction : neil lennon is mr celtic . best manager they've had in modern times .
weeeeell that got embarrassing in a hurry . what's scary is that it's the worst ac milan team i can remember , what does that make celtic ?!
 cruising at the moment 
i'm turing the celtic game off now feck that gutted played bloody shocking and no as if baracelona gonna help us for europa league üëéüëé
thought celtic were due a pumping in the cl . they are not good in terms of other top european teams
milan just playing about here üôä
gotta love these celtic fans !
thought i've been watchin the celtic game for the last hour but no it's the arsenal game , can tell a dont pay attentionüòï
oh celtic is dead tonight !! sowie its well th0 ..
the celtic fans who left the night before the fuckin game was over . ridiculous , you stay till the end no matter the fucking score .
hore milan celtic 3-0
centre half/left back in midfield and a winger playing up tops . shocking . about time celtic got a decent out and out striker .
3-0 over celtic , red and black till i die ! 
celtic loosing 0-3 at home to milan , excellent news , vile scabs
y u du dis celtic ?
hadi celtic gol at lan !
this milan side haven't won away all season yet !
wouldn't be surprised if celtic lose another couple .
saturday made me realize how horrible a football club celtic are
if , at 0-3 vs ac milan , you consider bringing on anthony stokes , then something is wrong , badly wrong !!!
well if this wins by 3 in celtic park , when every other performance is miserable , then the prophecy of dna and chl must be true !
still love celtic and believe .... but i've said from day one ambrose is just not good enough . he's spl quality , that's all
can't believe that , that was dreadful from celticüòê
millan are playing average , celtic can only blame themselves 
celtic not so super tonight sadly . had better defending days that's for sure 
the are running riot , 
i'm crying on the inside that i lost my bet . but i'm pissing myself laughing on the outside . 
celtic , completely outclassed by a very average milan side , are now resorting to kicking balotelli . harrison calls that passion . 3
sorry celtic .
the ref might as well be wearing a milan shirt .
unlucky , celtic .
where's all the plastic paddy's now celtic are losing 
if this was ac milan of 10 years ago i wouldn't be embarrassed but they are 13th in the serie a for fuck sake , and that's no coincidence .
no luck celtic and no composure in front of goal ! missed chances and poor defending ! commons needs to pull his head out if his arse too
to whoever said celtic was gonna beat milan you guys are fucked üòÇ
i don't think my dad quite gets facebook .. he just added me changing channel from celtic to arsenal as a life event ! üëçüòÇüòÇüòÇ
this is milan
3-0 down and the celtic fans still singing . thats the diffirence between celtic and english teams
to the people who are undecided whether to vote yes/no look at celtic park . these people vote yes . dregs of society . better together
for once in a long-long time i want celtic to do well , and there you go . i'm done with them . but come on ajax , hold out somehow .
ac milan is killong celtic
running theme with celtic , ac playin shit so they horse us , falcao hadn't scored4 atletico then did ! anyone else remember anything2add2this ?
taking defeat well , singing and kicking lumps out of milan .
some nights nothing goes your way 
celtic game has been moved to the gay adult channel due to the sight of 11 arseholes getting hammered was deemed to explicit for sky sports .
good to see a ref not giving celtic all the 50/50 calls
celtic are horrendous tonight
1if rory bremner cab pretend to be tony blair , celtic's back four can pretend to be a defence ! ;-)
tonight proves what level celtic are at
celtic supporters ; singing when you losing , singing when you drawing , singing when you winning !
who would of thought milan could pull a game like this ?!?!
some terrible defending from celtic
celtic getting pounded
milan finally making me proud
standard from milan tonight
wonder if lennon will drop his pals such as mulgrew who's never a midfielder in his life ! 
cmon to fuck celtic
this is cringing to watch !! getting hammered off the worst milan team i have ever seen !! need to take ur chances at this level though !
67 in the heat is lisbon the fans they came in thousands to see the bhoys become champions ! 
 are doing a great job tonight . 0-3 
holy shit celtic . happy birthday to me
poor fucking show , celtic .
it's about time !! 
with ambrose , we should call your defence ' nfa ' - milan lead 3-0 in glasgow .
how can anyone who believes strongly in been a patriot/ loyalist of england/britain support celtic ?!?!? i think they the worst club üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáß
and now ac milan are angry kut !
why do some celtic players ' shirts have sponsors and others don't?
milan doing the same thing juve did last year . ' cept juve are actually good . terrible result .
the worst team in years they said . it'll be a home win they said . 0-3 
i think its safe to say this is the worst celtic team for a long time . i can't remember us ever not giving a good account of ourselves
celtic don't help themselves by selling their 2 best players and replacing them with absolute shite
celtic need to get some decent strikers in the next transfer window ! centre backs are better than the strikers !
going from bad to worse for celtic
don't mind celtic or ac milan
celtic are obviously no where near the likes of millan . though people still slag off for losing because we managed to pull of surprises .
haven't won in 8 ? confidence low ? feeling the pressure ? here , have a celtic . 
am always gonna hate marseille for cheating us out the 1993 champs league final against milan ! arsenal a want 5 !
izaguire only celtic player showing a bit of heart , just not good enough
balotelli's finish for milan was class . 
celtic fans displays are horrible üòÇ
lol celtic should just quit playing soccer ! just dismantle that team
this celtic park myth can finally be put to bed ! shite team in a shite league
i'm like split 5050 . i don't really mind celtic i just love winding up the fans and dislike the ones that support the ira .
got tae laugh it celtic üòÇ champions league yer havin a laugh üôå
neil lennon said celtic could win champs league . think he meant chumps ( spl ) league . once again botton of the group & out . goodnight chump x
i don't think celtic will win this game
celtic score , we riot and pitch invade naked .
celtic really are shit
see milan ohhh , beating celtic .
can't believe celtic is letting my coupan down
end of the road for celtic
and this isn't a group of death wake up . milan and ajax are shite .
why celtic dh play barca so ?
no hooper , and crucially no victor wanyama . celtic have been pretty ordinary on the domestic front . is it such a surprise they're losing ?
25 minutes of torture to go , can celtic get at least a few goals back ?
celtic football club
i just woke up to hear my dad shouting up the stairs that celtic are getting beatüòÇüòÇüòÅ
this would be easier to take if milan were all over us but they haven't been . they've just taken advantage of shite defending .
celtic are only good in those impossible games against barcelona . they can never win bread and butter games . what's the point ?
here another one why replace commons with stokes ? a wouldn't let samaras pay his way into celtic park after the night
celtic have shot themselves in the foot against milan . the 4 goals over the 2 legs were poor defending or lucky . 
annoying commentator thinks celtic have a chance with 25 left 3-0 down ... 3logic
milan are a combined 5-0 vs celtic . how bad as are celtic ?
always nice to see celtic getting hammered the horrible cunts .
3-0 ? ha ha ha almost tempted to stop watching chelsea and watch the unwashed take a royal pumping !! 
it should be celtic-milan on nattv , but it doesn't matter anyway , i'm just watch it at another channel hahahaa .. cem siaran tv dimonopoli : |
milan are playing like milan
what happened to the celtic that beat barcelona ..? oh yeah , key players were sold . that's it .
told you stevie milano was going to beat celtic
so we're leading away against celtic but i bet we'll fail the coming match in serie a -_-
today's match a lesson in self inflicted wounds .
moan milan get another
scott brown will be back for the barca . the guy is about as effective for celtic as the proverbial chocolate fireguard .
samaras 14/1 streller 17/2 
fitba aff . terrible celtic .
3-0 milan winning !! 
we've been found out tonight . no real goalscorer and poor defending . sad thing is that milan won't make the last 8 . 
 
celtic losing to what could be classed as a mid table premiership team . lol
celtic need somebody like sam inglis in the middle 
surprised milan are winning 3-0 at celtic park .
why didn't milan bring this form to seriea
arsenal controlling things and celtic ... well the opposite can be said . atrocious defending
the thing that really frustrates me about is that we either bomb out of the cl in horrible fashion or qualify for the last 16
why always me !!! balotteeelliii ... !!! gooooaaaallll !!! milan 3 - 0 celtic
celtic .... haha ! 
don't think ac milan are a great team , very unusual to see any team giving celtic a thumping at celtic pk
that should have been a red card on emilio ‚Äù 
armageddon is kicking in now 
3-0 this is the milan i know 
celtic had no chance , ac milan is far better team
ouch that should have been a red for celtic , they are so shit
still feeling confident about my btts & celtic to win bet
dortmund have doubled d lead over napoli and jack wilshere gets his brace and it's 2-0 over marseille and ac milan are 3-0 over celtic . 
jesus celtic , match over
honestly celtic are fucking rotten horrible performance all they monkeys on a fortune and cnt kick a ball hopeless the whole team !!!!
ayee , super glasgow celtic
if milan wanted a game they should of came up to tannadice 
lovely birthday present from milan . wonder the last time we won by 3 goals . really happy
gwarn for celtic though ?! ac milan are 13th in serie a .
milan 3-0 ! headed to a second win !
milan smokin right now
good to see the rebel dogs taking a pasting , altho milan are just as fucking bad ! good to see a good prod kaka bang 1 in aswell ....
milan embarrassing celtic now
ac milan are putting in work , they're slacking in the league tho
can't help but wonder where it went wrong for celtic .
why do rangers & celtic fans obsess over each other when the other one is playing ? should your priority not be interest in your own team ? üôà
4 milan players in the box , 3-0 down , milan free kick , all 10 outfield players back ... 
common milan ! a few more !!
this is a carbon copy of juve game . missed chances by but under no real pressure , picking us off . gulf in class .
celtic fans 
milan am feeling you guys .
ac milan are 13th in there league and haven't won in 7 games :/
lol celtic
this milan side is terrible as well .
if we had taken our chances this coulda been a different story , raw shite fae celtic
celtic are pish tonight
forrest cracks one off .... the post . milan exposed 
safe to say celtic's champions league run this year has been fairly underwhelming .
what's italian for ' can we play you every week '... milan destroying celtic ! 
celtic need rangers back .. bit of league competition so the board spend some money for once and buy some decent players 
corner celtic
uefa - champions league - group stage - group h ( latest , 2nd half ): ajax 2-1 barcelona , celtic 0-3 ac milan .
milan have had celtic's pants down tonight ... 
can't believe celtic thought they were good enough to beat milan !
celtic setting themselves up to fail vs . barca with all of these yellow cards .
ac milan are clinical !
celtic is really missing wanyama
nice to see celtic are versatile & can beat teams by playing football & not just spoil a game and play for set pieces ... oh hang on a minute

i envy my fellow gunners watching the game , unfortunately they only decided to show the borussia v napoli & celtic games this side :(
celtic lucky not to be reduced to 10 . very poor challenge on balotelli .
brave celtic losing 3-0 . 
step dad jst said ' if celtic score 3 goals in the next 20 minutes i'll run up whiteford avenue in the buff ' hahahaha
why has stv got an english game on while celtic are playing in the same competition ?
some celtic fans really wanted to see ibra tonight , but he doesn't even play for milan anymore ! plus they missed out the " b ". silly bhoys
they shouldn't let scottish teams quality for the champions league 
just as well , my computer stopped working while the game was on . couldn't handle to watch it anymore .
so ac milan let me down at weekend n 2nite its frikkin barca 
ironic cheers from celtic fans when they win a free kick . maybe learn how to tackle ...
forza milan ... job done
self inflicted disaster at celtic park . terrible set piece goals to lose , which is a shame as we have played some decent football .
omg milan is soooo pwetty ! i really still can't believe dashun had a baby . i'm in shocküò©üòÅ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòäüòçüòò
arsenal winning , ac milan winning , everything's good
what's happening to celtic
hink ma 3 month olds a milan fan ! sittin watchin this pishin hersell laughin , arms n legs gaun everywhere !
no matter what happens will always be the best team in europe wether u liked it or not ! 
harder group than last year and with a weaker squad im just delighted we made the group stages . 
mario ! what a goal ! 3-0 ! 
not a lot makes me happier in life than seeing celtic get beat . love it
celtic definitely punching anyway
fuck sake celtic gettin beat at home ud think we were up against ac milan or summin .
celtic fans are fucking scumbags
super mario just buried celtic .. didn't think milan would walk over them at celtic park tbh
i can't remember the last time i've heard celtic park so quite . shame for the crashing out of again 
3-0 milan ?! wow , fair play guys .
ac milan have done their homework on james forrest . wee cunts not even done his own homework
jaaa celtic ft7 sitter till 2.75 !!!
a know milan there gonny turn up the night , poor defending by celtic but üòï
what a great representation of scottish football celtic are in europe .
if rangers were still about celtic would have a stronger team
so glad celtic are getting beat üòÉ
if your down 0-3 to milan and all you can call on is stokes then you know the board skimped in the summer ! 
celtic should be down to 10 !!
wheeeey celtic is loosing ..
how is celtic so shit against everyone but barcelona lol
celtic have been poor tonight . 3 cheap/preventable goals . but it's still a buzz to play in the champions league , win , lose or draw ! hailhail
bye bye celtic
people who see this result will blow it off as " celtic are shit and got smashed " it isn't even the case and that pisses me off
lets all laugh at celtic 
4-3 celtic stokes hatrick
folk will come on here and go ' milan cheats ' ' we never bought a striker ' but face it . lennon disny know what to do with those he's got now
" what you doing taking chances like that forster ?" asks anxious celtic fan artur boruc .
nothing better than seeing celtic getting knocked out of the champions league ...... 
best game this season n i want this to continue . .. 
vintage kaka , back playing in for . opened the scoring in glasgow earlier , milan lead 3-0 . 
looks like celtic might be out of europe now ..
lets see how far arsenal have come when they play the likes of ac milan , barcelona , madrid , munich etc
this is one impotent celtic team .
i wish could play like this every game 
must be a cracking atmosphere at celtic park tonight !
celtic üòûüòî
balotelli runs faster in an ac milan top
shocking score from celtic , sounds like they are playing awful , we wont even make europa league at this rate 
celtic fans have been cagey all night . little to no atmosphere compared to what they usually give . its just been a write off altogether
why i need to live in la : last night drake concert there were 2 jenners , a kardashian , snoop dogg , rihanna , nicki minaj , christina milan .
yes yes questo e il milan , than you will see we are going to lose next seria a match/
celtic cheer when balotelli almost takes the ball from their gk . your losing 3-0 in case you havent noticed
can safely say celtic have lost
as soon as celtic are losing they turn on rangers fans , like every time without fail
celtic u shit team ffs
green brigade is a joke aswell , celtic are scum ! hope we get a win on sunday !
can see nl thinking about leaving after this shambles & not just tonight . been shite since wanyama left , midfield is hopless
hahahahahah fuck off celtic you horrible cunts
watching milan just makes me so excited for next march .. just to be in the san siro watching them playy üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏èüëå
milan beating ppl in their own stadium :'(
fs celtic
useless celtic nd napoli .. mtschw
would hate to be playin at celtic park the now . think i'd crumble with that electric atmosphere
this is brilliant - not only are milan winning but the team they're hammering is celtic . marvelous .
ban celtic from they are so bad ..
this is like exactly the same as the last milan game
i wound how long it will be before the celtic fans bring up rangers tonight ...
celtic may as well concede more goals now so there's more chance of lennon getting the chop .
celtic park was meant to be solid too üòÇüëè some out of form milan spanking them
hahah celtic
if milan had done their homework they would not be doubling up on james forrest . 
so are celtic out of europe all together or still able to get europa which also seems highly unlikely ?
battle of the ex city strikers at celtic park . well , not really a battle .
ac milan are 13th !!! and celtic are 1st !!! how are they losing ?!?!
celtic . pride of scotland .
i hate celtic
milan&danny really need a lifeüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ !!!!
milan have that european dna among italian teams and are always proven in their champions league games .
unlucky celtic üëèüçÄ
also , too easy for milan 
milan always has some type of attitude . üòíüòíüòí like girll bye . ‚úåÔ∏è
can see nl thinking about leaving after this shambles & not just tonight . been shite since wanyama left , midfield is hopeless
mr o'neil should teach celtic zonal marking
knew i shouldnt have bet on that team !! put on them to be winning at half time and ac milan to win full time .. cause of the good oddsüëéüò´üò°üò°
did not and would not expect anything less from tonight , given the celtic board's lack of enthusiasm on the transfer / wages front .
celtic fc 3-0 milan ac
disappointed now celtic are out of europe , caley might need to try for the second half of the year now
looks like padraig will be celtic's lone striker in europe after xmas 
everybody hates celtic with their shitty political banners 
we wur pyoor cheated .... celtic fans mantra after being destroyed by ac milan tonight . blame the ref instead of themselves as per usual .
well celtic are out anyway
what is celtic park ?? 
celtic are not good enough for champions league what so ever dump of a team
5 games played , 3 points earned and -6 gd . do not belong in the 
celtic just can't get enough of losing 3-0 ? fair enough bang some more in milan
love ac milan
celtic won the cl yet ? must have surely by now ? i don't follow it cos my team are busy hanging about with losers in other leagues üíô
celtic problem is that they have turned into a selling club
what do expect , sold their best players and never replaced them 
i could actually see milan winning the ucl
celtic without scott brown are about as good as hibs
jack wilshere scores his second of the night as arsenal leads marseille 2-0 and milan now leads celtic 3-0
elsewhere milan are 3-0 to celtic
my dads password for his ipad is not the year i was born but the year celtic won the european cup
if celtic score tonight i'll cut off a bit of hair from my dogs tail and eat it
celtic are the most frustrating team to watch ever
3-0 super mario ac milan leading celtic awaits the backlash on sunday :(
celtic's defending tonight from set pieces has been embarrassing !!
really surprised by milan tonight . it'd be just like them to get to the semis of the cl and get relegated from serie a
get another injury , get knocked out of the school ulster cup in the most sickening way possible and now celtic are being hammered at home
just once , just once i want a middling campaign where we end up in the uefa cup and make a reasonable run in that tournament 
provan'milan done their homework on forrest ' whit ?? commons not great but keeping two wingers on ????
whoever's controlling this celtic team is gonna wear out their ‚ñ° button .
dad keeps changing from the chelsea to the celtic match .. can he not fricking choose one ... üôà
good song choice by celtic though , that ones a belter
when i see you celtic i go outta my head i just cant get enough i just cant get enough
favourite day is still when celtic beat barca last year ‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è 
if celtic want to do play at this level they need to sign better quality
celtic are still singing .. fair play to them
celtic played wank tonight and haven't taken chances
terrible performance by celtic
milan is beasting
3-0 no biggy lets go milan‚ö´Ô∏èüî¥

aye celtic are a good team at home eh ! 
jaysus celtic have been shite tonight

celtic attempts 13 : 9 on target ... ac milan attems 9 : 4 on target ..
' celtic havent lost at home in .... years '

only way celtic are scoring tonight is if wee tamsey gets the boaby oot
liam's gone to see the weeknd without me so my ma booked tickets for me , her and my daddy to milanüòÇüëå
jesus celtic are playing dreadful

milan is tearing celtic . bar√ßa can like to equalize now as d plan failed looool !
you know the champions league is getting serious when celtic falter and piss off out of europe ..... again
surely even the most optimistic celtic fan couldn't have envisaged a win here ..
dear milan , our next game against catania is also a champions league game so let's win it too .
how shit are celtic this season ? i hardly ever watch their games nowadays
canny remember a worse ac milan side in my life and were getting an absolute battering
jack wilshere scores his second of the night as arsenal leads marseille 2-0 and milan now leads celtic 3-0 
the celtic fans i know are so deluded üôà

milan finally winning a game
celtic without wanyama is just celtic
all the celtic fans greeting about getting put out the champs league . it was always an uphill battle for us . aye it's shit but stop moaning
as much as i love and support celtic , they are useless haha
looking forward to some cracking twitter fights between celtic fans later .
forrest is the only player that has played ok for celtic !
all that's missing is my brother laughing at celtic's shiteyness .
some people go on as if celtic are class
celtic smh
when i see you celtic i go outta ma head !!!!!!!!!!!! yasssssssss at least we are here !!! 
looking like the only celtic in europe this christmas will be them in the slammer hahahahaha
i was this close to sticking a fiver on milan to win 3-0 at 20/1 , spewin man
so poor from celtic , watched this milan side struggle to score against 10 men on saturday üí©üí©
hahaha ! 3-0 down at home vs ac milan & you fling on stokes , we'll laugh at this in years to come . thon lenny , he wiz mento , eh ? 
fucking love celtic
celtic 3-0 down but still singing their hearts out , some of the best fans in the world 
celtic can win the spfl + scottish cup ( double) ... ict can win the spfl + scottish cup + league cup ( treble) .. you knew it was coming !
we've been shite and gas thing is if vvd scores that volley we probably go on and win .. shite ajax team . shite milan team .
i'm firing ¬£10 on caley to win the league . celtic are just not league title standard .
gotta love the celtic fans thoughüçÄ i still love the club , just gutted with their performance in this seasons champions league performance
well it looks like celtic won't be getting any more money and widening the gap in scottish football yet further . heh .
hahhahahah celtic , 3 nil down off you trot fenian scum !!!
celtic 3 down and the fans still chanting 
no idea why i bother watching . too many poor performances in crunch games .
pure utter baws celtic . suppose it is the time of giving to teams in need . baws baws baws .
 is in shambles . playing very poor
this is the worst celtic team i've seen ever i think
celtic are a disgusting football club . sort yourselves out .
celtic without hooper , real madrid without ronaldo . same shit
yes ! get in there balolad my bets on now balo to score and milan to win looking good :)
milan are destroying celtic at their home . some say it's almost impossible to win at celtic . guess nobody told balotelli & friends that .
 is milan
celtic are so bad ... need to switch off now . 
someone add celtic to the cunt list , only team letting my acca down üò§
jack wilshere scores his second of the night as arsenal leads marseille 2-0 and milan now leads celtic 3-0
ac milan are lying just 13th in serie a at the moment , 20 points off leaders juventus .
in doha back from milan .
celtic songs are sooo catchy
ac milan are 13th in serie a . 10 points adrift a europa league spot and 20 points adrift of juventus in top place .
celtic are 3-0 down yet all you can hear is " i just can't enough ". one word ... class .
balobeast kakabeast milan beast ! 
only 4 shots on target for ac milan . 3-0 up .
shouldn't really allow teams as bad as celtic in champs league ....... diminishes the competition !!
milan haven't won away all season & they are absolutely battering celtic . celtic are fucking shite .
milan winning , dortmund winning . awful night .
hate watching celtic get beat
awww wait ave just remembered .... milan are one of the biggest clubs on the planet
celtic's next game is away to barcelona , from the looks of things , barcelona b would beat them
unlucky celtic
the time i bet on celtic to win at home they put in a performance like that
barca must score . i hate them , but an equalizer between barca and ajax is perfect for milan .
tehe celtic getting beat and ajax beating barca . celtic deffo out , night made
when i see celtic i go outta my head . i just can't get enough , i just can't get enough . 
very poor celtic
always nice to see having their arse handed to them . even if i do have a soft-spot for forster
celtic have missed 2 sitters and other chances , they should have had a penalty and they've defended like they would in the spl , nightmare
even chris killen was on the pitch , albeit briefly , when celtic last beat ac milan . chris ... killen ...
naedoot celtic will slaver oan how they should have won the night
at the end of the day celtic are a shite team playing in a terrible league
celtic fans singing ' i just can't get enough ' really makes no sense
the ac milan top is fucking mint
poor old celtic , i'm gutted ! 
hopefully hearts can have a crisis like this against celtic on sunday ...
absolute shocking game tonight from celtic ; disappointing the fans üò¨üò¨üò¨
thought milan were meant to be shit ?
on a side note , montolivo's ball to ballotelli for milan's 3rd is fucking gorgeous
fucking hell celtic 
see if ambrose wants to leave celtic at any point in the near future then am really not gonna mind
don't you just love ac milan !!!!
terrific effort tonight .... by the celtic and milan fans . shame about the effort of my team tonight 
celtic 0-3 ac milan . damn . 
it's great to see kaka fit and playing well for milan again !
celtic fans are hilarious !
how scary is it that milan may be the only team to advance in the cl while they're also fighting relegation . incredible .
lol the celtic live app has just asked who i'm going to vote for as man of the match for celtic !?!? err um
look at arsenal and milan trying to make life good for me
devastated for celtic :( 
i just can't get enough . 
people said celtic never turned up away to ajax i'm guessing it's just the same tonight considering i remember fuck all of ajax away
and it's tatty bye from celtic 
ac milan and inter milan have lost it
canny see celtic going all liverpool on milan tonight ... 
honestly the defending from celtic you wouldn't even get up the mungo
fair play to celtics supporters though , 3 nil down & still proper going for it . 
how are esker celtic even in the champions league
two unknown celtic fans just left the pub and the veteran in the corner just gave us a rendition of ' oh the bluebells are blue '. hero .
3-0 now for milan . balotelli nets for the first time in a long time .
my mate just text me " celtic are shite because they sold stone cold and the rock then replaced them with buff bagwell & maven "
when i see you celtic , i go outta my head i just can‚Äôt get enough , i just can‚Äôt get enough 
celtic are just dreadful
i really shouldn't expect too much of celtic
and celtic too
milan beating celtic 3-0 ... this makes me truly over the moon !! üòÑüòÇ 
if you don't support celtic , you're not irish .
brilliant fans still singing !
would celtic cope in the english championship 
i cannot possibly hold any players or manager responsible for tonights bullshit performance . the blame lies entirely with the board .
celtic i am peeing @ u
that's what celtic get for selling paddy mccourt .
hate celtic , so glad they're loosing 3-0 to milan
i see everybody has jumped back off the celtic bandwagon 
and are ac milan not pish now ? üòÇ
no words ... just tears ! devastated ! packing up my broken heart n going into hiding . unlucky celtic we'll be back 
ajax and barca at home and milan away were all admirable performances , the last two have been so poor though , disappointing ..
sice celtic are worse than pish tonight ill switch to watching scotland curling on eurosport ! a sport we are actually good at !
this is a big morale boosting with for milan !!! huge !
bye bye ..
everycunts a zombie again now celtic are getting beat üòÇ
how is milan so good in cl & absolute piss in serie a . maybe serie a is a great league after all or allegri only brings out tactics in cl !!
this milan team haven't one away all season üôà
jelly and ice cream if celtic score
lets just face it we never expected celtic to win .
whoever's controlling this celtic team is gonna wear out their ‚ñ† button .
let's all laugh at celtic . bye bye !! üëã 
celtic - wasteful , milan - clinical , defending - atrocious , champions league - out , kaka - maverick , green brigade - superb , rangers - dead
 this is milan ... ‚ô•
can't be doing with celtic fans on my tl ...
least celtic are getting beat . 
celtic 3-0 down and still singing quality fans ..!
still an amazing atmosphere at celtic park even when we re 3-0 down . 
3rd goal milan ??? who again ?
milan way too good i'm afraid .
i want you to be weak . as weak as i am - milan kundera
typical celtic fans
celtic fans still singing . fair play .
letdown tonight celtic but fuck it me and the boy connors on the tonic yess
glasgow celtic look poor but it's a huge step up from the one horse spl .
don't even want to discuss the celtic game , can't sell your best players and replace them with pish .
celtic had the beaten of these lads at the san siro , but could`nt pull the trigger , same thing happening tonight .
goodnight celtic ‚öΩ
milan 
even the most ardent of celtic fans have to admit that this is such a poor celtic team . the team reflects the league we play in i'm afraid
respect to the celtic fans still singing , may be 3-0 down but still proud 
nice to see kaka looking like a top draw footballer again 
 is making things harder for even when they are not playing each other . 2-1 , 0-3 
get in ac milan loving that 
celtic only themselves to blame giving away cheap goals and not taking there chances
milan needs barca need to tie this !!
ac milan got this win today üòà‚öΩ‚öΩ
at least there'll be 5 fans in europe after christmas ... 
any epl team would have beat this milan side
why oh why did i back celtic
ac milan get their third . super mario scores a delightful goal !
celtic park has went fae bein a fortress in europe to bein a karaoke bar 
just waiting on celtic fans coming out with who are rangers playing , same old pish üò¥ 
n dis is game over 4 celtic
celtic have forgotten how to defend
don't think there's a celtic player in that team that could grab a game with the scruff of its neck and change a game ! 
the decisions not to do some major investment in the team in the summer look even worse now 
felice per il 
" milan is a winnable game "
kaka looks so right to be back in his milan shirt 
how wrong was i about celtic
hope a milan player praises the atmosphere the morra , it will make me feel better when i read about it on the website
celtic are getting their arse handed to them hereüòÇ
don't know what's worse about celtic . some of they're racist fans or the fact neil lennon is a cunt
this is the best i have seen ac milan all season they have been dead the rest of it there like 13th in the league
celtic being embarassed by milan at home . i wonder how long it will be untill the win against barca will be mentioned
celtic are defending like postal tonight haha
honestly ! within 5 minutes of watching the celtic/milan game , 3 people were on the ground complaining about a " sore leg " üëä
fuck off out the champions league celtic , get back to your t cup league
looks like teams are getting their results raped up . napoli are down in dortmund , arsenal lead at home to marseille milan winning etc 
your not irish unless you support celtic
don't know who i'm more disappointed about that they're losing , celtic or barca . probably not the best day to wear my celtic/barca scarf ,
dreadful celtic .
kaka !!!! forza milan stana katic 
celtic have had 7 shots on target ac milan have had 4 .....
one of my hobbies is ' watching celtic get pumped in the champions league '
celtic ain't ready for europe . any player in the scottish league hoping for international glory is a joker .
well this is monumentally shit 
so ........ celtic - milan draw looks like it was a good bet :/ 
" celtic's third defeat in 24 champions league home games ". or if you prefer , their second defeat in three 
celtic fans are amazing win lose or draw there always singing just a pity about the players on the park performing &through
... oh celtic we love you !
kaka : created by milan , destroyed by madrid , re-created by milan
ac to be first team other than barca to beat celtic at celtic park in 24 champions league games 
dear dear , not even thursday night football for celtic . my heart bleeds .
when last did ac milan play 3-0 ........ impressive !!
balotelli drifting wide right is proving to be extremely dangerous for celtic tonight .
a thought milan might of beat celtic but a was shocked with 3-0 milan !!
i know milan are only playing celtic but they have played very well tonight . far better than i thought they were nowadays .
keep calm and forza milan
fair play to the celtic fans still singing
3-0 milan .. that's what happens when you put a championship side up against the big boys
celtic's champions league dreams are dead , just like bobby sands
just wasn't meant to be this year .......... we will be back tho !!! 
milan now 3 nil up & ajax beating barca 2 - 1 which as it stands makes the milan v ajax game winner takes it all clash
cant wait to see the amount of excuses the celtic fans bring outüò¥üò¥
seriously though milan , how the fuck can you do vaguely well in cl and just crap it all to pieces at home ???
with celtic losing it doesn't actually matter if we win or draw this game . we would still be guaranteed 3rd & need to beat milan to qualify
ac milan are 14th in serie a lol
celtic fans can't moan about the ref it's just that celtic are playing shite haha
just shows you bad they are . getting beat by the one of the worst milan sides in history . 
why do some celtic players have sponsors on their tops and others don't? 
how shite r celtic lol
from the golden days with nesta and maldini to zapata and constant- milan ultras
 losing 3-0 at their cesspit . i'd love to see that ground collapse into the sewer and dump their fans with the other fucking rats .
since when did a celtic and ac milan game have anything to do with rangers ?
celtic now playing my 2-4-4 overload 14 formation . shame they are having the same results with it as i am as well :(
we are winning 3-0 at celtic's home after that crappy run of form holy crap
we love u celtic we do ..........
when i see you celtic i go outta my head i just can't get enough .. ya cannae beat the scots fans 
jesus can we fail in spectacular style can't we . 
celtic still making up the numbers then
fucksake celtic
never thought the high point of my day would be making lentil soup 
actually took celtic on my coupon after watching milan in a few games recently worst milan team ive ever seen but handing out a beating here
give them it .. takes balls to still be a celtic fan still singing knowing it's over hahahah
nothing makes me happier than seeing celtic get beat üòÇüëè
big boys for milan have been brilliant tonight ! balotelli and mainly kaka ! 31 years old and still fitter than our players ! 
will celtic average about less than 30,000 now they are out of the champions league ?
i fucking hate celtic i really do wank shit club 
it's never embarrassing watching celtic , just disappointing at times .
heavy pumping of milan tonight . :-(
that's my accumulator gone and with that are gone as well ! 
ac milan 3-0 celtic
milan on fire .
pish this milan team
barca needs milan to tie this !!
lovely the way milan have went about there business #üôå
yep , celtic are fucked
united would beat celtic
milan starting ta shape up now 
this is how i like watching milan play . 
‚óñ‚óó‚ñ∫ ‚óÑ‚óñ‚óó‚ñ∫ ‚óÑ‚óñ‚óó‚ñ∫ ‚óÑ‚óñ‚óó ‚ñ∫ ‚óÑ‚óñ‚óó‚ñ∫ ‚óÑ recorda la pelota es redonda , balotelli las tiene cuadradas siempre viva milan
and milan is winning 3-0 this is a good cl day !!!!
oh come on celtic . i despise you , but you're a british team . milan have been dreadful this season . how can you be being hammered like this ?
celtic will not hold on to lustig or ur man van dijk .. ( cant spell his name ) and forster the rest are complete dung lol
need a celtic goal here .. pretty quickly ..
celtic game off arsenal game on time to watch some real football
meanwhile , barca is out here fucking up celtic's europa league chances ... 
all i see is the milan red n black jersey ..
20 minutes left of this game , which means a whole 20 minutes listening to my brother moaning about celtic losing üòí
i wouldn't even say need to completely rebuild . stop indulging samaras , find a goalscoring striker and acquire a passing midfielder
typical celtic fans , celtic 3-0 down and the fans still singing away !! :d ! nb
celtic 3-0 down and should be down to ten men . zonal marking hasn't worked tonight , static defenders at corners is never good .
people shouting about the celtic fans .... been singing all game ... down 3-0 listen to that ... ' for we are celtic supporters !!!' !
at least get a goal celtic
come on celtic please score !!! 
celtic are fuckin horrendous . defence very poor and fuckin samaras is their main man up top . their midfield isn't too bad mind
channel is the celtic game on ??
milan turn on the style on a hapless celtic 
sat here watching the barca , chelsea , arsenal , dortmund and milan game all on one screen . 
not easy to win in celtic and almost impossible to so it with 3-0 . great work , milan ! our focus this year is on 
watching celtic is defo having a knock on affect on my health ! full time alki by next season ! 
win lose or draw celtic till i dieüçÄfaithful thru & thruüòç
" the celtic park is a tough stadium ." l m a o
was a fan of ballotelli before tonight but scoring against celtic has taken that to a new level 
even when look dreadful domestically they find a way to get it done in ..
without those kind of superstars , celtic will never reach the top level again
seriously thought celtic could play better than this
aye big names in this group but ajax and milan are rank rotten , replace the spine of last year team with quality we mighta had a chance
i like to see celtic win as much as the next person does but let's call a spade a spade there shit ! 
" mediocre milan team , mediocre ajax team " aye , shame we're 10x more pish
que the anti-lennon tweets . 
never mind though thats ac milans 3rd win in 15 games , oh shit did i mention celtic are 2 of them winsüòî

haha celtic pummelled by a poor milan side .
celtic are shockin ... and barca are just as bad tonight !!! 
all this rangers fans chirping up now celtic are getting beat annoys the fuck outta ' me

correct score 0-3 traded at a high of 40 , now into 2.28 in the celtic v ac milan tie ! mario balotelli with the 3rd for milan .
celtic should give james forrest to the police , he's shite anyway .
i tweeted yesterday it would be 3-0 to milan , see i it finishes that il no be happy , should have fired a couple quid on it
milan doing something good at celtic's park
milan define european pedigree . how they're doing better than us in europe is beyond me
sometimes , i have to admit , i wonder , does the team deserve the fans ? 
glasgow celtic champions
milan >>> celtic ÓÄò
celtic have been playing shit recently so this performance isn't a surprise . just a shame the worst had to be tnyt !!
had to turn celtic off after the third goal , watching it was just painful and embaressing , goodnight
milan in serie-a : meoooouuwww ... milan in champions league : rrrrooaaaarrrrrrrrgghhh !!!

looks like it's a good thing i didn't watch the game ffs !!! 
ma stramaccioni allena il celtic ? 
had celtic down for a draw , really expected more from them especially on a european night at home !
 haven't defended well and are blunt up front , even domestically . get the best striker possible but i don't think this is a crisis
pumping celtic in their own back yard ? come on ac , that's soooo 2 months ago . 
if celtic don't score against milan lol
it's funny watching the celtic game on tv when i can see their stadium from my flat .
on a positive note borrighter has played as well as i've seen him in a celtic jersey 
i just remembered in september i placed a bet on milan to win the champions league looool forza milan
celtic have more possession but ac milan winning 3-0 fuck sake
milan victory looks assured following balotelli strike . will ajax hold on to a victory here ?
if the scores stay as they are ... barca need to beat celtic and hope for a result for ajax to win the group ......
if celtic were in the premier league would they be any better than the likes of fulham and sunderland .
celtic need to understand their just like every other club in scotland .... not good at that level . had their wee bit luck last season !
celtic good luck qualifying for europa league could be a struggle
so its official that barca milan bvb and arsenal qualify to the next round right ?
kaka , balo ... damn good ! champions league is our dna forza ac . milan
celtic are sitting here with 13 shots and 2 on target hahaha fuck sake
have to agree that celtic have the best fans .
we are celtic supporters , faithful through and through
neil lennon makes me hate celtic even more , seriously can't wait for the next old firm
is this the dreaded celtic park ?? 
3-0 good shift milan
the awkward moment when you think milan already finished in ucl because their poor games in league , beat celtic in their home
disaster of a night for 
final thought : i can't remember the last time i saw a fan comment on a result . plenty of comments on us tonight though
i didn't realise celtic where so poor . zonal marking you having a laugh
only half decent player celtic have is lustig üëç
playing on the world stage of club football and putting in a shocking performance like that against a shite milan team is pathetic
celtic getting taught a lesson stick rocking wee the green brigade fleet rule eh support dundee celtic bhoys
whos celtic lead scout hes a good eye for a donkey
of course milan were going to win , celtic only get results when their 100\1 to win or when there's nothing to play for .
delighted celtic are getting fucking smashed . useless cunts
ref should abandon the celtic game man , how can you play wi aw that glass and shite on the pitch
if ya never looked at d tele ya would know celtic were playn by the amount of tweets !!!
milan finally played intae ma hands . hoops now 350-1 tae win 4-3 
wow some of the bias nonsense you see on twitter is hilarious : l aye , celtic aren't a particularly good team , but they're in the cl

ashley hemmings is on for milan lalkovic ....
71 lustig heads wide . celtic still persevering but it's not been their night so far .
i hate when celtic are getting beat and their fans decide to refer to us lol
i suspect that the celtic fans will spend the rest of this match trying to make themselves look ' great '. 
the amount of abuse celtic gets really really really does piss me off .
damn that milan player is uglay
and now the fans of the club formerly known as rangers can take a break from celebrating the big win against arbroath to slag celtic 
ac milan are red rotten . just shows how bad we are . im gutted !! a must win game and not a sign of heart or passion from any player .
typical celtic fans , down 3-0 and singing away love it ! :d 
goooooaaaal ! mario balotelli makes it 3-0 for ac milan like : neymar junior for nex update
celtic aren't as good as they were past year with hooper and wanyama
celtic making gainful effort ... lustig decent header , but goes wide . i don't think either team would complain if the ref blew the whistle
69 ' - celtic 0-3 ac milan seems is back on form and point 2014 is calling .....
hahahah fuck off celtic
milan killing it at celtic park .
to think milan were in turmoil ........
celtic have to get into english football . if its good enough for cardiff and swansea then it should be good enough for them 
football is going well tonight . milan , ajax , dortmund and arsenal are all winning and barca is losing^__^
i know that we buy skoda's to play teams with ferrari's but ffs celtic stop giving away gift-wrapped goals !! cannae keep up santa defending !
bit bothered even tonight itv is showing arsenal and not celtic v milan !
peak for celtic
milan fans have to realize that mario is gonna let them down in the knockout stage . he'll play against a good squad & pout the whole match .
i could have watched the arsenal game at home with a carry out . spent a lot more to watch celtic .
do the aberdeen fans slagging celtic atm not realise that the better celtic do in europe the more money their club gets for doing fuck all
watching champions league go milan !!! 
all these mungle rangers fans slagging celtic for getting beat in the champions league ! 
celtic are gittin a humpin
lustig is celtics best player , should have bought doyle instead of pukki ! 
is this how 2 play the ' celtic way ' ?
celtic better hurry up and score 4 after sticking 100 golden nuggets on them earlier 
what the hell is that coming on for milan ?!!
fraser forster is stuck wae the rang celtic team , wae his ability he deserves tae have been in the larsson n that team

the ac milan manager looks like nick from coronation street
donno why anyone is ripping into celtic , sorry but don't see any other clubs with a harder group
signs i've given up a game of football : i'm checking twitter for tweets about more than watching the match
can't get over this game , 4 on target 3 goals for milan ? 7 on target for us and not a sniff ! need to learn to take our chances 
it's funny how bad celtic fans take defeats 
well at least celtic won the sing song 
their fans disgraced scotland in amsterdam and now their team is doing its best to embarrass us in glasgow . 
defensively horrific but jesus milan are shocking
lets all laugh at celtic 
subs milan : birsa out - constant in

milan fan or not , how can you not like insigne ?
ac milan are a very good side
its pretty clear italian teams dont give 2 fuck about the " powerful " celtic park
this is not a fuckin celtic team
celtic have been utterly abject tonight . bad news for the spfl in multiple ways .
looks like celtic are gonna let me down why did i back them fucking cunts
why can't the celtic manager dress and look like a leader , rather than a loser . would you follow ?
now milan fans are saying ucl is in their dna forza milano more than a club
do celtic have the worlds most pessimistic support ever ?
grande milan !

milan are 3-0 up . we need to win this to stay in the champions league 
milan have been quality tonight , if they played like this more often there would be no problems ! 
the worst ac milan team in years , a poor ajax team . it wasn't that much of a bad group , we are just terrible .
c . zapata doubles the lead for ac milan . milan 2-0 celtic .

" kaka . 32 .... and he's still breaking his neck to get past balotelli ." provan , d . 271113
celtic are doing well
56 - mario balotelli has found the net for ac milan after 56 days - six games for the rossoneri without scoring . relief . 
this is shite , milan are crap and are still hammering us . total lack of quality from the hoops .

if celtic loose against motherwell i'm not going into school on the monday
celtic poor but usual over fussy incompetent officials too
just no celtics nite tonite just can't seem to get to grips with the game still love the bhoys in green can't win them all 
mind they burned effigies of beckham after france ' 98 for his red card costing england .. scott brown screwed celtic dearly with his lunacy
oh god , just seen an image of the ajax fan who fell from a stand at the celtic game . i hope he's alright , doesn't look good .
waiting until the 85th minute for the ' we give up ' anthem " we are celtic supporters faithful through and through " üòÇ 
come on shittt celtic get me a goal
take it i should be glad i'm not watching the celtic match then ? by the sounds of it , gary caldwell is back in central defence
wonder how the record will justify the " so brave " headline this time 
celtic you scottish twats come on !!!!
celtic need to get up to date with the modern game and buy a sitting midfield because a flat 2 in midfield is outdated . 
good to see so many ac milan fans in our megastore today buying rangers goods . said good luck to a few . turns out they didn't need it üòÑüòÑ
i had celtic 3-0 
lets all laugh at celtic lets all laugh at celtic la la la la la la la la
always a good crowd at the celtic games
pls tell me ambrose isnt the cause of everything at celtic ?
celtic . getting creamed again ...
really want celtic to win but its never going to happen
tablet is in front of upc box and im stuck watchin celtic .. muck soccer !!!
celtic suck winkie bum
celtic especially lennon never learn from previous mistakes such as tactics or zonal marking ! a better manager would have got us qualified !
has faithful through and through been started yet ? and the usual " better than being a hun "? disgusted with celtic .
hahah fuck off celtic irish twats
56 - mario balotelli has found the net for ac milan after 56 days - six games for the rossoneri without scoring . relief . 
poor celtic , they really just don't have european quality
loving this milan performance
celtic have far more attempts and more on target yet are losing 3-0 ‚úãüòí
a team 13th in their league are beating celtic , unbeaten in the league , 3-0 at home , truly reflects how abysmal scottish football really is
i now feel how i feel in my last trip to celtic park i just want a goal for the craic
it amazes me when people expect celtic to qualify , celtic will not qualify , because celtic are shit
hate celtic more than any other team 
celtic game came at a good time for milan , a much needed thrashing against european minnows to gain some confidence for the league
71 ' celtic glasgow 0 - 3 ac 71 ' ajax 2 - 1 
celtic getting beat 3-0 at home haha , rangers won 3-0 away from home last night ! 
oh i think it's time , i know a few of you have been waiting ............ lets all laugh it celtic ha ha ha ha lets all laugh at celtic
so glad milan are smashing celtic . come on mario , heap more misery on lennon .
celtic fans display questionable banners before game and celtic get humped . is that karma then ?
why is hooper not on for celtic ?
just in from training , i see celtic have got a right good result the night ! wearethepeple
i'd hate to be a celtic fan
never mind celtic you have already qualified for it next season
you can't expect celtic to sell there two best players and expect them to challenge the group they got without bringing in stronger players
arsenal , milan are hot , barcelona cryin , chelsea diggin it with harzard
celtic fans are quiet again ...
what's happening celtic , 3-0 milan obviously not our night
celtic are an embarrassment
when the draw was made i thought how boring , milan and barca again . i could never get bored of this . roond the lot of you scaffy bastards
 | 0-3 | minuto 75 .
i know milan are winning but i still don't think they recycle the ball quickly enough . 
this just shows how good our team is !!! a down and out ac milan team winning 3-0 shocking !!!!
üò≥üòÅ omg milan's coming over
anyone know how celtic are getting on at their ' fortress'??
just seen the score of the celtic game 
im glad who celtic got in the ucl group
tell aw the tims you kno . milan are up 3 for sure .
a lot of celtic fans are just scum
poor from celtic tonight . missed chances , need a goal scorer , and zonal marking against in the champions league is embarrassing !!!
samaras trying to show the ref something . what is it with these celtic players and their inability to keep it in their shorts ?
remember when this milan team was full of superstars ? maldini , pirlo , kaka , shevchenko , inzaghi ! very poor these days !
get your shit together celtic
refs an absolute arsehole , celtic are still rubbish , usual !
long gone are the days where ya knew every ac milan player ! not half the team they used be ! 
 celtic - chelsea - bradford 3 goals ¬£ 1,400 ! 
celtic r fucking brutal !!! not even close to being in the same grounds as the other teams ! 
love a celtic defeat ! especially in the champions league !
' celtic live ' just sent a message - " who is your man of the match ?" - you're fuckin kiddin , right ?
üòÇüòÇüòÇno way celtic fans are singing here we go three in a row üôàüôàüôà they're getting pumped 3-0 and have no competition in the spl
3 nit to milan , fucking celtic scum , lennon ya little ginger cunt , which 1 of ur bhoys are u shaggin tonight . celtic= pedo family
im delighted balotelli scored haha celtic !
no going to lie a follow 300/400 odd celtic fans and not once seen them blame rangers fans for our defeat ??
celtic getting fucked 0-3 so they decide too sing " here we go too ten in a row " hahaha
sittingvin my sest at celtic park truely gutted . another game lost due to shambolic defensive play and an inability to play a striker .
celtic ... not so much just can't get enough , more like just not good enough . pedestrian in defence , blunt in attack . domestic tedium awaits .
think celtic need to make a few signings , all these we 1 and 2 million pounds ain't working anymore , start spending celtic !! üçÄ‚öΩÔ∏èüí∑
celtic don't deserve to be down 3-0 here , bad defending at set pieces aside . lustig has been impressive going forward though
celtic have been poor tonight , so frustrating
kevin constant enters the fray . celtic , be afraid . 
celtic fans the morra when they realise there out of europe already are going to say , so and so said the atmosphere was great
anyone know the celtic score ?
getting beat of milan is almost as bad as being in the second division ... almost as bad
hope all rangers fans r enjoying the celtic match ha ha
celtic need gundogan
lol @ celtic
need a celtic goal !!
howard foster would stop this celtic match right now
just over 15 minutes to go , not a lot to report on , corner celtic
come on barca ! beat ajax for us milan fans !!! 
christmas has come early . celtic pumped by the worst milan team in history and won't even qualify for europa league :-)
celtic can't defend corners 
celtic voting a resounding yes to independence . ... from europe
celtic stadium quiet ! :')
56 - mario balotelli has found the net for ac milan after 56 days - six games for the rossoneri without scoring . relief . "
celtic should give up .... celtic 0-3 ac milan
i like laughing at the people from forres who support celtic for no legitimate reason get pissed off at them doing shit .
if only brown never got himself sent off . what a miss he's been 
celtic fans shown again just what total scum they are . time for uefa to act & ban them . it's not like we'd miss watching them 
that allan johnson is doing much better as ac milan manager tonight . or it really allegri ? 
a wonder what celtic's excuse is tonight
too bad celtic raped :( * bye bye *
why always me ? - mario balotelli score utk milan .. 3-0 ..
hi remember when celtic had a backbone
celtic fans are just the worst .
forza milan , 3 and counting celtic , bye
am i the only one that can see a celtic comeback ? lol . some dealings in the transfer market this year . fannies .
oh dear , what a shame , how sad . come on milan - make it 5 .
liverpool sing " you'll never walk alone " way better than celtic !
celtic's european form has been poor this season . really a surprise after what they achieved in last seasons campaign .
ac milan set to correct their poor away form with an almost certain win against celtic
the green brigade are celtic's motm
ballotelli og ...... 4-3 celtic . wow . what a game .
lol , imagine we actually did ourselves justice this time round in the champions league . imagine . 
3-0 down celtic should give rogic a run !! 
ac milan is winning 3-0 against the celtic !
when you think the evening is going well with allegri , he goes and sub on constant 
no where near enough pressure on the milan players tonight . they've had time to pick pass after pass . 
easily the worst celtic team in a while . think there something there no
fucksake celtic
celtic proving that they are in fact a pub team in a mickey mouse league
outclassed tonight , the buyer team won well . we need a champions league class side . 
the only worthy replacement from celtic losing the spine of their team was van dijk for wilson .
it's funny seeing all the rangers fan tweeting whenever celtic are getting beat
ambrose can take players on better than any other celtic player and he plays centre half
lovely day for milan 
glad to see celtic gettting bate !
' bobby sands ' starving army ' out in full force tonight . remember , he died in a bed covered in his own shite . 
could've sworn i read celtic in the article .
3-0 down to the worst milan side in years . not replacing hooper is costing them in the big time
score celtic come on !
jaysis , i'm glad i forwent watching celtic to listen to music i have to review .
from a celtic fan that's pretty rich .
:( shite celtic
fuck off celtic üëã
celtic doing well again
shit performance from celtic , aren't the same team anymore .
it's a real shame . based on this performance i think celtic would have been capable of getting knocked out the europa league as well .
win lose or draw , celtic forever ! üçÄüíö
milan have pounded celtic and that's that .
has been appointed as manager of briercliffe celtic . 2014
celtic should just pause it and go to quit game
forrest exposed his bits celtic were exposed on the pitch seemples
celtic you twats !
you have to applaud most of the celtic fans in the ground that haven't left even though the game is finished .
celtic . need a new manager imo , lennon has took them as far as he can and they need someone new with a different style o football
after the week i've had watching spurs and celtic think it's high time a got new hobby why fuck can none of my teams score a goal ...
how does milan do this in europe&still struggle in serie a . opposite of what every other fucking serie a team does 2 fuck up the coefficient
ajax winning or drawing tonight has the same effect on their chances qualifying to next round , they need a win either way against milan 
never in my life have i hated a small team like celtic , theyre like a combonation of inter juve barca and lazio , plus they suck
arsenal and milan are winning . im happy
hahaha loving the fact are getting smashed & i hope they finish bottom
just not happening for celtic tonight .
who is this ref ? he's no far off celtic the night
celtic fans need to realise the board will not spend any substantial money whilst the club are in a dead league . profit over pleasure .
that so called green brigade at celtic park are a bunch of terrorist supporting scum . the authorities need to take action and soon . shameful
 getting a fitba lesson
ac milan leading 3 nil , they go into the serie a and continue their poor run , nonsense .
a reckon rangers would beat milan 3-0 , jon daly hatrick
i'll still wake up a celtic fan , goodnight
i get so angry at celtic when they play shite like i honestly feel personally betrayed .
majority of celtic fans will start saying how shite rangers are and how they're not in the champions league now that celtics getting beat
so happy celtic are losing and going out :)
nice defending by milan players
some of these celtic players couldn't score in a brothel
haha celtic ! 
milan on blood ..
just not happening for celtic tonight . on !!!!
well done celtic just got to hard of a group this year 
i've seen amateur teams with an average weight of 15 stone+ play more flowing football than this celtic team !
according to one prominent celtic fan , a banner of bobby sands " goes to the heart of the matter ". was he good at defending corners ?
milan running riot in glasgow
milan should take me out to go get frozen yogurt üòí
supporting ac milan for the night just to see them beating celtic ;)
that's honestly an embarrassing performance from celtic . defense is all over the place . van dijk is the only good player for us tonight .
come on need celtic to score
celtic land race to 9 for the inplay double . torquay need 2 more . come on
i'm seeing more rangers fans tweeting about celtic fans tweeting about them , than i'm seeing celtic fans tweeting ? üòÇüòÇ
" support celtic cause they are scottish ", i would rather gouge my own eyes out with a tea spoon
celtic need a jon daly
' 73 milan sub - birsa is replaced by constant .
if you replace the likes of wanyama and hooper with mediocre shite this is what happens . celtic could play aww night and no score .
75 celtic force a succession of corners but they just can't get that killer final touch .
without rangers in the spl , celtic will never be a success in europe
lol a lot of celtics fan are leaving the stadium like " damn we down by 3 , smh that's game !" üòÇüòÇüòÇ celtic 0-3 ac milan ! 2 ‚öΩÔ∏è
so many things a want to say about this game and current campaign but a canny fit it all in one tweet haha !! 
kak√° got a goal for ac milan with a header from the corner
thankfully , inverness will be in the champions league next season to stop celtic's constant embarrassment of the scottish game in europe .
half of celtic's squad look like eastern european brick layers
its hard for celtic there up against aberdeen there on saturday and have to go from that to playing ac milan ..
celtic under 3
starting to dislike derk . thoroughly un-celtic like of me .
i think i would rather spend an intimate piss session with r kelly than be a celtic fan
if only milan played like this every week , hopefully this will give them a bit of motivation
celtic need to buy gary mackay-steven pronto !
3-0 down and the celtic still sing
celtic really are poor . this has to be one of the worst ac milan teams i have ever seen . celtic badly need a striker . shud put van dijk up top
as much as i hate to say it . but maybe it's the right time for celtic to look for a new manager !!
embarrassing tonight celtic the blame lies with the board we needed a quality striker and 2 goals in this champs league campaign proves it !!
celtic are woeful in front of goal too . what do you expect with samaras and stokes though .
that celtic player van dijk or whatever , is woeful . give it up mate ! 
 ....... always deliver when it matters
milan 3-0 up .. celtic pressing but to no great effect ... 75 mins gone ... a time machine would be handy right now ..
this referee has been a fucking a joke . not as much as the chance taking by celtic but this ref has been amazing , such a prick
samaras , playmaker , captain , hero and celtic legend , after two decent games against inverness and partick .
noooo :/ not constant . watch celtic‚Äôs 1st goal .
ac milan fans singing big jock knew . 
strachan's celtic would've shafted this milan team .
celtic thinking the can beat the likes of ac milan ... wowüôà
samaras shows referee bonera's stud marks down his side . sorry , but a ruck had formed 
kaka is playing great for ac milan . 
jim watts scorecard has got celtic winning this on points
how good would it be if celtic won the champions league and rangers won the scottish cup 
get a grip , the only reason celtic fans tweet about rangers fans is cause rangers fans always all seem to appear when celtics getting beat .
i guess people are ok with this because the fans are still singing and we beat barcelona that time ? 
where's the celtic fans today ?
its 3-0 milan lets go
this is such an embarrassment they've handed milan all 3 goals and not 1 finisher on the pitch
every time celtic get a chance the ref blows his whistle wtf
used to like celtic , not no more
milan having a decent game . would like to see them do this in the league . against roma ofcourse
this ref is so against celtic it's arlass
3-0 down to ac milan and he puts on anthony stokes . game changing .
wish we had a striker like , well , a striker .. 
celtic fans always being rangers into it , we only say stuff cause were rivals , that's what rivals do , use do the same but we don't complain
goals from celtic , chelsea and schalke would be smashin ... no happening but !
76 ' celtic 0-3 ac milan 
reff has had a poor game but celtic need to take a long hard look at their defence , no-one to blame but themselves .
vedo il milan in finale 
three massive keys for milan tonight : kaka's leadership . professional pride and engagement by his teammates . listen to arrigo sacchi . ;)
hope action is taken against the scumbag celtic fans banner glorying terrorists ... well done milan 
kick ass is on film 4 , slightly less gruesome than the kicking celtic are currently getting . 
i genuinely support celtic in europe coming from a rangers fan , show me luv pls
nice defending by milan players
celtic really need good players , they've actually replaced their best players with shite ones
i miss the days when celtic were good
milan is sha having fun ... ajax ahead of barca . chelsea neva score . no be the same basel wen dem trounce last time ?
well celtic may put on their saddles worst ref ever
0vsacmilan3 samaras & efe ambrose are the only players putting pressure on this milan side .
gutted , lifeless . 
celtic getting pumped tonight doesn't bode well for the jts on sunday .
" celtic gave milan a gift with the first two goals " another way of saying your team is shit
you can't set fire to a match without a striker 
celtic are playing utterüí©üí©üí©
milan will win the champions league üò≥üôå
oh no celtic
celtic's defenders were sent a letter containing tonight's tactical instructions , but they all failed to pick it up .
i actually taught might have won this tonight jesus they are brutal defending the set pieces 
looks like milan can do it on a cold winter night in glasgow ! 
if a was a celtic player i'd give up & start complementing the milan players on their hair do's , some toppers out there
celtic you are shit !!
the main reason i hate celtic though is daveüòâ
watched doctor who again . switch it off and it goes back to the celtic game . what's that in the top corner ? 0-3 ? surely not at parkhead ?
milan should be on that programme splash ! bloody good at the diving !
celtic 0 - 3 milan 2nd half 
can't remember a celtic side playing this bad in a champions league in a long time
come on celtic üíî
ac milan will beat barca 3-0 but go lose 4-2 to parma . i cba with these serie a teams
with celtic going the way of communism and clarence seedorf in leaving europe . lets get your ideas in to spice up the rest of the season .
aahhh well ! ucl , its been fun again . ain't no shame in going down in this group . nou camp in a fortnight . 
hate when girls clearly don't like football but when it comes to celtic they somehow become some sort of football tactician
please celtic and coventry score then this means i can have 2 nights out this week !!! please
why are barcelona fans scared ? aren't you still the top of the table in cl ? even if milan win they will only have 8 points . barca still 10
celtic can bring this back !
milan seriously what
as a dunfermline fan i find it hilarious when rangers fans try to slag celtic fans for getting best in the champions league . sfl2 what ?
celtic have the best fans in the cl . amazing .
celtic on baiser mon ticket
i'm happy mario has scored . go milan !
the celtic i was brought up watching always had several leaders in a side , can some1 name one in this celtic sqaud ? 'sheartlesspussys
imo celtic have little or no physical power in the side . a good gust of wind could nearly blow some of our players over
mulgrew v barca van dijk v milan ye miss blatant chances like that at crucial times in a game then yer headin out on yer arse 
3 stupid goals lost to italian opposition . learned nothing from last year against juve . ah well , we'll be back next year . 
watched 15 mins of the celtic v milan tonight , to think we let nigel de jong go and replaced him with garcia 
this ref is just brutal . not his fault celtic is down , but just an all around poor officiating display .
heavy celtic fan by the way ppl , just yellin the facs . need to b put in the better leagues n even then we will not win .. scottish foot sucks
political statement made by some celtic fans tonight 
its hard for celtic tonight rape charges can put u off they will be fine just go home and stick their lost prophets cds on
aye its funny fan celtic are gettin gubbed .. but itll be funnier fan the rangers go into liquidation again 
celtic being dismantled at home milan means business
how are milan doing ?
celtic are woeful !
celtic being ripped apart in glasgow tonight by an average milan team ! if barca don't draw it could be gone in november ! 
celtic played quite well but simply don't have the class to make a difference . would investing a little more in a striker have helped ?
celtic are a very average europa league team at best
the harsh reality is , as in the first tie , celtic have lost to a poor milan side . the italians have struggled to put two passes together .
celtic leaving to beat traffic ehh now we are gubbed 3-0 and out of europe
ac milan 3-0 celtic
this ref is nuts . it feels like every call has gone against . 
got to love all the hype about the celtic game tonight as in how they have a fighting chance , not anymore 
celtic fans always , always refer to 1967 , 46 years ago when they get beat .
has paul mcconville actually died or is it a joke cause celtic are getting rodgered ?
ajax are like celtic from last season . celtic are like celtic from 20 seasons ago .
4 measly goals celtic thats all we need as long as they don't get another corner kick !
love how celtic are getting beat
celtic really need a decent striker striker
celtic have been turned over but this reff is shocking man !!
some of the worst defending i can remember seeing from a side 
milan is doing it for me tonight ... i wee pop enuf babcock bottle water !!
if kaka stayed at milan instead of wasting away his career in madrid , he'd have one another ballon d'or
celtic is being raped in their home ground by ac milan celtic 0 - 3 ac milan 74mins
having a bad run of results with the sporting teams i throw my support behind . having their turn tonight !
celtic men against bhoys . terrible defending . lennon's stock exposed again ! 
happy to see milan leading away , its been hard for them .. man like kaka also scoring .. icing on the cake
i would care much much more if blantyre celtic got than celtic !
referee ? come on to fuck . i'm leaving celtic park .
this referee is terrible ! 
sammy you spa !! 
celtic defence simply hasn't turned up tonight . yes i'm talking to you - mikael lustig , virgil van dijk , efe ambrose and emilio izaguirre !
you get what back what you put in , in football ! and celtic deserve nothing from this game ! made too many schoolboy mistakes
the celtic - ac milan game is just bringing back all my hatred for cuneyt cakir 
elgin could take this celtic side
huge win for ac milan 
doesn't make a difference but this ref has to be one of the worst i've seen . every time milan ask for a decision he gives it .
bad night for celtic
celtic fans leaving in droves already ! 
ya i heard celtic can finish in the 6 yard box
massively different ball game for celtic in the cl . they don't get away with all the usual fouls that scottish referees " don't see "...
at least celtic are getting destroyed to ease the cov score
celtic fouls so much üòÇüòÇüòÇ
celtic are getting rough .
celtic need an outright goalscorer . someone to do the same job as hooper has done in past seasons . they don't have that this season
celtic haven't even played badly they just haven't taken their chances
it's times like these that celtic justify their best fans in the world status 
kaka has shown what milan is all about tonight . 
looks like celtic's only representation in europe this year will be 5 bhoys locked up in amsterdam . 
we have bn defeated but our love for the club can never b broken as we r glasgow celtic a club like no other 
it's good to see celtic get nothing from a referee at septic park for a change 
celtic lol
there is no greater joy on this earth than watching celtic get tanned 
celtic ??? what the fuck ?? nkt
i fucking hate celtic
looks like celtic players got their christmas money up .
has to be said , milan fall over really well .
milan can handball it & get away with now 
can't believe celtic fans are trying to equate bobby sands and william wallace . how spurious can you get ?
ok given the fact how badly milan has been lately , its tweet 0-3 to celtics made me think we are losing by 3 . thank god we are winning .
well .. at least celtic give it a good go again in champions league again this year , had the group of death , but well back again 
city and celtic getting turned over is a bad tuesday night !!
not much makes me happier than seeing milan play like milan
if i had an under 12 team who gave away goals like celtic have given away tonight , i would expect to lose .
arsenal dont look bothered , marseille .. shite .... celtic on their way out , messi-less barca on their way back ...
the referee for the celtic game is a 
win lose or draw we are celtic super celtic ! üíöüíö
voglio un professore come 
celtic fans are pure awesome . definitely going to celtic park in 2014 for a cl game 
horrible campaign for celtic . ' best travelling fans in europe ' and ' fortress parkhead ' both debunked
samaras is world class against kilmarnock but not against milan , ajax or barcelona . i just don't understand it .
the turkish referee in celtic park isn't giving the hosts anything 
really feel sorry on celtic , definitely the hardest group without a doubt ...
celtic have been poor tonight !!! but the referee is a joke another wannabe celebrity
celtic shouldn't be anywhere near the champions league . anthony stokes commons are on ffs . 
sack celtic !!
i love seeing celtic getting smashed in the 
too many jersey fillers in this team ! can't expect to sell the spine of a solid team and progress without quality investment !
that celtic team are a bad lot
a thought celtic were at home tonight ?
" ied student looking for an apartment in milan walking distance from your university ?" sim
celtic slowly becoming the best comedy act in the world
loosen the fucking purse strings peter lawell because there is not a striker in the celtic squad that can finish his dinner .
fantastic to see a lot of milan tweeps been retweeted into ma tl . team spirit
basically been all celtic apart from the three goals tbh
i've got ac milan and both teams to score 
a very poor ac milan side had not won away all season then they went to celtic 
sad thing is if we lose to hearts on saturday that's the season over ... 
celtic you burst ma chops üò°üò°üò°
fair enough celtic r shite the nite but this refs doin my tits in
referee is absolutely abysmal ... bit like celtic tonight !
it looks like milan is on fire , 3-0 up at celtic park .
celtic are a one man team - chris sutton
a team to watch out for in the uefa : ac milan .
i thought ac milan were on the slippery slope ?
don't blame celtic fans for leaving , far too coldüòÇüòÇ
sometimes i wish the celtic fans widnae accept 2nd best ! let board know how u's feel ! too many within club wae fat pockets ! !
some celtic supporters make me giggle
ok given the fact how badly milan has been lately , its tweet 0-3 to celtic made me think we are losing by 3 . thank god we are winning .
we're celtic supporters faithful through and through ! ! - joe67 -
ffs ...... slightest touch and its a foul tae milan .... big virg get pushed at edge of box goin for a heider .... play on ! 
rangers fans tweeting stuff when celtic are getting are you's playing cl football naw didny hink so 
hate seeing all these cunts leaving early , might be a pish milan team but guarantee 80% of them would walk right into the celtic team !
celtic with their usual tactics . losing and taking out the legs of the other team . always pull this
the ref is a wee bit dodgy ! but celtic are shocking !
fucking shocking celtic ffs
i see the supporters are being faithful through and through by leaving early 
2 goals for the campaign so far says it all no flair to create anything up front and not strong enough to hold out 
as a dunfermline fan i find it hilarious rangers fans trying to slag celtic fans for getting beat in the champions league . sfl2 what ?
possession has been 50-50 . celtic just can't seem to get the ball in the effin goal
no magic this year 
what if barca is playing bad so milan won't move on ? you heard it hear first folks !
hahahaha ac milan have had izzaguire running in circles man ! ripping the pish out the poor lad ! brilliant to watch though
embarrassing that celtic fans unveil a banner of bobby sands at a football match . i await the media outcry about it ...
probably better odds for ac milan to win 5-0 than celtic to even scoreüòÇüòÇüòÇ
now milan have to work hard and keep a clean sheet . lol these shitty ass defenders we have
be frustrating to be a celtic fan tonight . all you ask is they give everything but tonight they have been very poor against an average team
celtic game was an absolute disgrace 3 shocking mistakes at the back led to being punished 
love ac milan and celtic ... wish celtic could at least get a goal ... can always trust my good old bvb to win though ! 
cannae believe celtic fans had a flag with bobby sands on it hahaha what the fuck has that got to do with anything 
celtic kick start ac milans season after allwe are the charitable club
how samaras is celtic captain is beyond me 
milan 7 games without a win and not won away in all season and pump us 3-0 at home ! fucking joke
celtic are playing terrible
my celtic to win prediction hasn't gone too well .
celtic are fucking awful ... disowned üëä
milan is here !!!! i got home just in time !
its very frustrating supporting ac milan , because they've always been a side that chooses whether to turn up or not ! 
barra kit would be cool like that milan one
champions league referees really do hate celtic
milan couldn't win away from home all season , and they go to one of the cauldron of european football and win . weird team .
we dont need a red card to win in celtic park , lalalaaa ~
why are the so called greatest fans in the world leaving with 20 mins to go . 
got 50p on arsenal to win 2-0 , milan to win 3-0 and chelsea to win 1-0 .... come on chelsea 
glad celtic get n a bit of a thumping , hope milan get 5 . spl , pub lge .
" who are celtic ?" - george weah ‚ù§Ô∏è
celtic aren't even on the same planet as this poor milan side .
feel for celtic . ref's a wanker
celtic could go and beat barca and lose to patrick thistle on the weekend
celtic have played tam kite
looks like the real kaka is back as well . he suits ac milan better i suppose .
people talking about celtic having shit fans , 3-0 down and european dreams all over and our fans are still singing .. shite fans , aye ?
wonder how much celtic so called supporters will be ranting how good their team is ? 
bye celtic ... üëãüòÇ
credit to celtic here , we are still trying to play through milan and make things happen
1 goal from celtic would do my bank balance massive favours
another season of football comes to an end . was hoping for atleast cup . no cigar 
ac milan i hate you : l
on the plus side nobody inside celtic park will have cold hands tonight
celtic still in europe after tonight .... well in european jails anyway ....... fail fail 
most girls that support celtic do my nut in , ' what yous all about ' clearly dont realise ac milan have won the champions league like 7 timesüòÇ
how come any time celtic drops points in any competition they automatically throw the hate towards rangers haha . 
next european appearance for celtic will be when jim forrest makes an appearance at the european supreme court of justice for being a beast
celtic are so so so so so shite somethin needs tae change
fuck me celtic üôà
midnight memories performance at iheart radio's album release party was amazing !!!! cany wait to hear it live in milan next year !
celtic may lose the game tonight , but neil lennon certainly beats max allegri in the style battle .
celtic are so fucking wasteful , it disappoints me so much
great game for milan !!! definitely going to advance to the next round with a 3-0 lead ! forza milan !!
watching nigel de jong play this well is making me think of javi garcia and , subsequently , wanting to cry a bit 
celtic are gettin a spanking the night 
celtic's defending is more worthless than lance armstrong's tour de france medals
haahahah fuck you celtic ! i was right !
3-0 away to celtic !
celtic are not on form tonight üëé
and to top of my bad mood celtic are loosing wtfüëäüò§
a sad campaign for celtic . so much hope at the start but no potency up front and midfield not up to it .
even super mario got in on the action at celtic
so milan will become only become 3rd team to beat celtic at home , after barca and juventus
milan haven't won away all season , yet they come to arguably the hardest place to play in european football and they're 3-0 up ? 
celtic fans leaving already and they say they are the nest fans jn the world ....
is it bad i'd have kris boyd at celtic ? 
yes i agree ian i thought i was watching live at the apollo till i pressed celtic and realised it was a footy match
why do celtic make scoring goals look so difficult ?
all we need is 300 ultras to storm celtic park tomorrow demanding a response from the team and board and we'll beat barca .
celtic are defending like lionel hutz after suffering a severe stroke .
still can't wait to go to barca !! 
samaras pushes the milan player in the back & points to the ref that he was fouled !! where did this baboon come from ?! 
brave display from celtic tonight üôä
i think of henrick , sutty etc . . who ever seen them have a bad game or give in ?? we have devalued the hoops .. milan ultras were right ..
feel bad for celtic getting humped tonight . then i remember their fans . fuck em .
should be a wake up call for the celtic board . barely scraped into europe and this is as far as this current team could go . need to spend ..
celtic players love playing musical statues . need to tell the gb to keep playing and don't stop
 have been terrible tonight , but the ref is so bad its bordering on suspected corruption .
c'mon da fuck celtic
must buy that ac milan top .. not cz there stuffing celtic . but cz its nice . anyway celtic hav t best support in europe 
have you been watching some of the celtic game , what do you think of their performance
celtic and marseille score consolations and i will be rich
once again celtic's poor finishing has let them down . we need a prolific striker , a defoe or similar to progress in europe . 
ah , celtic . ye break mah heart sometimes , ye really do .
celtic wouldnt win the loi
i've got ¬£1 on milan 3-1 . just score celtic you bastards .
now saw numerous celtic fans blaming the referee , 3-0 is nothing to do with a ref ... just sheer class
ahahaha celtic ... come on milan ac . ever
celtic can't beat a pish milan team , i'm not going into school as protest
how about that milan team ?
a celtic goal every 3 minutes would still do it , but i'm afraid it's not gonna happen this season
ahaha whats with this commentator everytime celtic touches the ball 
finally a milan victory . even though celtic gifted us the win . man cannot complain . seven games without a win finally coming to an end
this is what happens at this level when you dont take your chances . having a striker on the pitch would help also but hey ho .. 
celtic just canny score .
tommy rogic is coming on for !
celtic park's some fortress these days
the matches in group f are more exciting anyway . barca is overrated and milan sucks .
get balde on give him a chance fs . development 
celtic just aren't good enough and as for forrest i've never been a fan just don't think he's good enough 
get paddy mccourt on !! 
the celtics will be on it tonight about how rangers could never beat milan when it has no relevance to them
forever celtic
ouch at the celtic score . need to win at the san siro and nou camp now ? 
it has been completly laughable how shit celtic has been this season so far - jst goes 2 show that serious money needs spent on this team ...
i wonder if any milan player has fallen over and not gotten a free kick in this game
the game over 4 celtic
james " the beast " forrest off for celtic
milan a 100% üî¥‚ö´Ô∏è
whether it's a nba team from boston or euro trash soccer i'm always happy to see a team called celtic lose
i'm a bit upset the milan game isn't on tv , but this bar√ßa/ajax game isn't bad
a dinny care what anyone says but celtic need brown
well since the guy from my uni . is released .... i dnt have to feel like bad anymore for being happy that ac milan won yaaaaaaaaay
ac millan have malled celtic to parts tonight ! 
celtic could play in europe every day for the next 3 weeks and still wouldnt score
nah ac milan are actually quality need to see them next time they are up playing county
terrible play from celtic üòïüëé
doesn't actually mater haha cause celtic aren't going to beat barcelona
poorest display by a celtic team at home in europe !
emanuelson's pass completion rate is 100% .................................. for celtic of course !
sub celtic : tom rogic replaces james forrest , 79 ' 
kak√° will always perform his best at milan üëçüî¥‚ö´Ô∏è
fuckin joke all these big game hunters leaving soon as 3rd went in what happened to faithful through & through 
aberdeen would have raped milan tonight
yess i belive this is not end but this is new star forza milan
rogic ! 
so happy are out , fucking 
79 the game looks out of celtic's reach the the hoops faithful are still singing . 
o yeeaahh .... i can sleep well ... cause ... i smell what a big wins here ... forza milan .. 
kris commons is celtics main goal threat and he's a midfielder . teemu pukki is a poor mans stokes and balde is just not celtic class .
so how many celtic fans have switched to the ajax game then ?
out-fought and out-thought tonight celtic .
sure if me did bet celtic wuda buss me ticket , worst side ....
frustrating for celtic but they'll have to grit their teeth and move on . very important that lennon learns and stays strong .
biggest difference in the champions league is you got to take your chances when they come along . 
guys robinho is coming on there is still hope for celtic .
chelsea were always gonna play for a point tonight . dunno why i chose this over celtic vs milan üò¥
ac milan cruzing now . 3 goal lead . 
ok given the fact how bad milan has been lately , its tweet 0-3 to celtic made me think we are losing by 3 . thank god we are winning .
coach denies ac milan players arrived late for training
forrest coming off . rogic coming on ... forrest essentially marked out of the game .. acm doubled him up all night 3-0 10m to go
milan send on robinho for kaka . 0-3 after 80mins .
humphrey cushion coming off for celtic
fucking celtic üòí
i see celtic are getting hammered . such a terrible crying shame . 
we are really looking like 4th seeds here .... in other news i imagine that the milan manager is like an italian glenn reoder !
milan 3-0 celtic
this was as tough a group as you could get but sad , after playing so well first couple of games , how this has fizzled out for 
celtic 0 milan 3 ' 78 
celtic's european dream is set in stone , back to scottish football for the fans and back to the grain to start the cycle again for next year
 i sleep in peace when milan wins and barca loses
best piece of play by celtic tonight . taking forrest off .
whole house supporting milan because my mothers a life long celtic fan , family values ehüéâ
genuinely saw someone say " why do i even support celtic ?" well fuck off you prick cause we don't want you
ref in the celtic game still hasn't improved since last year !! 
milan players going down after the slightest touch ... ruins the game .
intermediate cup 3rd round 14th december lurgan celtic v camlough
robinho coming on for ac milan , this is the difference , what we are up against
screw this i'm watching celtic against milan
fuck this , just pulled a filling out as well . great night celtic # yhangs
celtic done in then eh ?
celtic have however reminded me that braveheart is a fucking quality film
we have responded ! forza milan 
decent from the celtic fans applauding kaka
you have to admire the celtic fans not leaving early even if it's all over bar 10 minutes 
tom rogic ! 
milan ? maybe its same case with milan last year , poor in league , average in ucl ..
ac milan didnt beat celtic tonight , celtic beat celtic or neil lennon did ! i am gutted that a mixture of penny pinching/tactics have cost us
sure its not boselecta on the celtic left wing .!
milan scoring 2 from corners and not getting dominated in the air ... weird
 il celtic park applaude kak√† . o forse applaude robinho , vai a sapere .
milan boys sayin o keep this prick on
i now looking to blast celtic about letting zapata score but then i remember muntari score on us last season 
balotelli and kaka the difference in possibly the worst ever milan team .. in saying that celtic rely on samaras
nice to see kaka getting clapped off by the celtic fans
robinho in kaka ' out 80 ' celtic - milan 0:3 
i always enjoy milan play in cl . something about milan in europe juve haven't been able to do . yet
celtic fans applauding kaka . at least they have some respect :)
üíöüçÄwe are celtic supporters faithful through and through and over and over we will follow you üíöüçÄ
celtic are so abysmal it's hilarious !
david and ben have an argument every time celtic play
78 minutes too late with the celtic substitution
celtic would be winning this game on another night ... so many missed chances
celtic fans applauding a genius !
celtic are good ... üòÇ
shouldn't be 3-0 to milan in this game , so unfair on celtic . they have had so many good chances just like the game at the san siro
ajax fan rushed to hospital cos he fell 10m . mind the celtic fan fell down a tier at parkhead and was still partying ?! 
wow celtic have been mauled hahaha didn't see this
oh to have a kaka in the celtic team . a joy to watch and tore us apart
i remember watching tom rogic in that nike academy thing years ago , now he's playing against ac-milan in the champions league . wow .
where are the haters of milan ??
forgot robinho played for milan
finally something to cheer about in milan . 
celtic are a terrible team ...
celtic fans are probably being pessimistic singing about 10 in a row . milan look happy to settle for 3 .
would love a celtic goal right now ....
it's nice to see aubameyang scoring goals . at least that proves milan academy is one of the best .
ffs celtic utter pish .
celtic got pipped
hahaha celtic sub forrest for rogic milan sub kaka for robinho
i wish milan play always like that !!
rawtid ac milan 3-0 celtic look like celtic gone home from 
celtic are a different team from last year , utter pish
kaka ' getting an ovation from the celtic fans when coming off 
kaka was sensational tonight ! celtic fans clap him off ! 
i thought robinho left ac milan .
just like for iniesta , celtic park gave kaka a standing ovation as he was substituted .
fans saying time for change from lennon ? remember where we was in 09 . milan were a wounded animal tonight . we did make it easy though .
nice to see kaka being applauded by celtic fans when substituted . respect .
celtic maaaaan
celtic-milan 0-3 
grande .... even the fans applauds him ...
celtic armchair fans do ma nut in üòÇ never been to a game in their life but one green night a year though aye that makes you a supporter ? lol
celtic fans applauding kaka . at least they have some respect
it's safe to say celtic are out 
rangers an ac milan :-) xxxxx
what a waste of a champions league spot celtic are !
scott browns gotta away with murder for his part in celtic cl campaign 
celtic signin jelavic in january 6 months to late
fairplay to the celtic fans clapping kaka wen he got subbed , lot of respect üëä
nike the chance product tom rogic just made his debut in the champions league with celtic . believe
tommy rogic has just been introduced against ac milan . celtic currently 3-0 down . 
i don't care for football much anymore but the referee in the celtic game is shambles
in his black suit white shirt and skinny black tie the ac milan manager looks like a funeral director . or a hitman .
nice to see celtic fans applauding kaka , very rare you'll see your opponents fans do that
can you here the celtic sing no no can you here the celtic sing no no can you here the celtic i can't here a fucking thing oohhh ooohhh 
to any celtic fan that clapped kaka at celtic park tonight , get a fucking grip and worry about your own team , not milan 
celtic should start the rebuilding for next season's cl now . we will never progress with mulgrew , kayal &ledley , so lets see the young guys
jez hayes doesn't dislike celtic , he just doesn't really like them
' milan were doubling up on forrest tonight ' - provan makes a change i guess
wish i could put a bet on now for marseille to score and celtic to score
quite alot of celtic fans not tweeting on this fine champions league evening ...... 
a well deserved round of applause for kaka from the celtic fans . a true gentleman of football . 
very effective , professional game from milan tonight . nothing else required . maybe different if tic hadn't missed sitter at 0-1
tommy rogic is on v ac milan . 
i don't like milan but if there's a team i always hope makes it past the group stage other than juve obviously , it's milan
robinho on .. celtic fans applaud ka ka as he leaves pitch 
think tony soprano has the refs family in a car boot somewhere 
long story short celtic were shite and the refs a nacker
nice touch from the celtic fans applauding kaka there
brutally brought back down to earth celtic üòí
good gesture from celtic fans applauding kaka . world class .
an unknown on for celtic , robinho on for ac milan . hmmm .
tom rogic on for the last 10 against milan 
tom rogic on in 79th min for james forrest . celtic 3-0 behind against ac milan . go tommy 
thats its celtic , fuck off back to the spl
kaka has been brilliant for milan tonight ! awesome player to watch when he's playing like this .
shocking defending by celtic .. all could have been prevented !
is it just me or does italian teams alwayssss break ma heart when it comes to celtic in cl
celtic let me down one team every time !
celtic need a flash of brilliance from james forrest
we need some tony watt magic 
celtic fans applauding kaka as he goes off .... aye im sure that atmosphere is terrifying to plan in : |
find it staggering celtic fans defending tonight's display by gb and some hoping the ajax fan who fell at game tonight dies 
celtic need a strong rangers
unless your own club is playing in cl , your jibes at celtic mean absolutely fuck all . and you just look bitter and idiotic .
cmon celtic just bucking score !!!
kaka what a player always had respect for him , he plays for the badge and plays football 
sportsmanship - celtic fans applauding ricardo kak√† i tifosi del celtic che applaudano ricardo kaka ' 
glad the celtic fans clapped kaka off , what a player
our team may be a joke , but the celtic fans are incredible : still singing , and applauding kaka as he walks off .
love how when celtic are getting beat the fans take it out on rangers 
batted in amsterdam for fuck all fuck you barca fuck you celtic
celtic fans applauding kaka off the field . can't hate on absolute 
when i was in primary school i used to dream of seeing celtic play in the champions league and rangers to be extinct üòÑ‚öΩÔ∏èüëç
celtic are leaving these ( definitely going to happen ) 4 goals very late .
as of now , next game decides whether ajax or milan goes through
bit of a drubbing for the celtic , milan are a very poor team aswell
il mio milan bello che sta vincendo 3-0 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è yeyy 
man of the match ricky kaka 
celtic have taken a massive step back since last season in europe . can't blame it on harder group as milan & ajax were there for the taking
congratulations to tom rogic european debut of the bench for celtic ! glad to see the aussies over there .
tom rogic on in the champions league ! what an occasion for the young man , coming on against ac milan . 
celtic fans applauding kaka off . classy .
score in celtic match ? 
no excuses anymore we aren't even in the same league as these teams no investment and selling key players has fucked celtic
kaka has raped celtic tonight üòÇ
even celtic fans applauded kaka while leaving . 
even celtic fans had to applaud kaka 
emilio and sammy working hard tonight for celtic , and i've said it about 100 times now but ambrose is shocking at centre back
even though milan have beat us tonight i would still say our performances against them am barca mean we are till one of top 5 teams in world
been watching celtic tonight . neil lennon makes me smile . he's like a vexed gerbil .
when is everyone going to realise forrest at this level is no longer " quick " combine no strength + inability to cross 
poor ac milan side beating celtic at parkhead , now where's celtic famous support ??
the whole celtic park stadium was cheering & clapping for kaka .. simply sensational today
celtic fans aint impressed as ac milan lead by 3 goals
the ac milan goalie is 76 years old and hasn't broke a sweat . he'll be waiting till he gets home to milan for a shower in his nursing home .
wish celtic could just bring on robinho after 80 minutes ....
ac milan 6/4 at celtic for me that's stealing money it's celtic at the end of the day
hope you are watching this pish like the rest of us pedro !! too many times now you've let a magnificent support down 
milan is actually a decent team . they have many good strikers .
celtic fans boo'd kaka when he came off . wow .
how the fuck can you call yourself scottish ? you say everytime celtic are in the champ league " c'mon such and such " get to fuck !!
feel bad for all those celtic fans paying in the region of ¬£150 for a champions league package and watching that dross 
at least celtic have got a league cup semi final to look forward too . oops !
ac milan still call kaka golden boy .. hardly a boy
robinho on for kaka celtic fans applaud him !!
kaka getting ovation from celtic beautiful
if celtic were in the epl , where would they finish ? take our poll and have your say ! 
anyone know the celtic score ?
looks like milan's ultra protest/threat has worked .
thats the worst ive seen celtic play ! waste of petrol going to the game ! !
sadly , celtic ambition has been exposed at this level . we have not got the quality to progress beyond group stages .
fuck lennon and his zonel defending . not the celtic way booooooooo
shows real class clapping off kaka by the celtic fans ! even in a frustrating situation
go and fuck celtic , they were there for the taking , just stick to scottish football
milan have not been the same since gattuso left 
tbh celtic don't even deserve to be in the cl ..
only lustig for me earned his wages tonight , also have to say this is the worst milan side i've ever seen
kaka is some player still , good to see the celtic fans acknowledge that
kaka applauded of at celtic park . he was unreal tonight . 
nothing worse than watching celtic lose . always next year i guess .
celtic are like school bullies . terrorise the small kids but when they have to face the bigger boys they really are nothing special .
does anyone think that , now there is absolutely no hope of even uefa cup , we should go to the nou camp and play 3 up front ? 
grande celtic ! kaka deserves applause from everyone .
congratulations to tom rogic european debut off the bench for celtic ! glad to see the aussies over there .
its a shame that celtic got thrased by milan .
celtic fans leaving . classyyyyy
loooool barca is losing , and my milan got this game rapped up
celtic fans applaud off kaka when they know he's a class player . he'd be receiving shouts of f*nian bastard if subbed at scumville
cheers celtic for ruining my day ! good job i love you ... loads
robinho on for kaka ...... that's what you're up against people . remember that when you start slaughtering players/coaches 3-0 acm
three ex players now on the field for milan . the only one i miss is de jong
celtic fans unreal , clapping kaka the great off the pitch and 3.0 down , best fans in the world show respect to all great players 
ac milan beating celtic 3-0
81 ' celtic 0 - 3 milan 
good to see the celtic fans clap kaka off the park
a chelsea and celtic goal would go down nicely !!
celtic fans clap off kaka 
forza ragazzi ! 
milan did their homework well . they marked commons . he's at the moment our goal threat .
a few quiet celtic s umbags tonight , it will be smashing if they dont even make the europa league . 
celtic fans only turned up after the third goal . before that very meh and right now all i hear is the gb
celtic fans applaud kaka . tomorrow's scottish paper headlines " kaka wants to play for celtic " 
how many more excuses will ian crocker be able to make before full time . conveniently forgets this is the worst milan side in living memory
i think john hartson still thinks celtic can nick this haha
them goals should never off happened celtic players will be kicking themselves for them goals absoutley shocking defending tonite 
you could have had a stefan klos & larsson with change to spare for the price celtic paid for teemu pukki .
very rarely will you see celtic park as emptying as it is 10+ mins before the end of a cl game . been that sort of night .
i love ac milan walea my forza
was oot shopping and just found oot celtic are getting pumped it home
james forrest flatters to deceive and fails to flatter - again 
celtic fans still singing , faithful through and through
what a shock the celtic fans are leaving
welp , goodbye napoli . maybe even juve . and barca is tanking so well see about milan .
rogic won't make it at celtic .
and wow , celtic fans applauded ricky !
kaka is alegend , even d celtic fans are applauding him when he was substituted
how did beckham miss ? 
kaka came off as well to a fine ovation from both sets of fans . he's been superb tonight . robinho takes his place . 
some celtic fans are a fuckin joke , applauding opposition players man . get a fuckin grip
i have forgot when milan won 3-0 last time . ... but wait ... i think i have even forgot when milan won last time .
shows the quality difference of celtic to milan . forrest off for rogic kaka off for robinho rogic on forrest off , hope that's permanent .
congratulation to my arsenal fans , ajax fans and indisputable ac milan fans for today's winning . abeg teach them lesson
 played well today for 
fail fail ...... i just can't get enough 
bye bye celtic
thomas rogic plays for celtic !?!?!?!?
kaka has still got it . great to see the celtic fans applauding him as he walked off the pitch ! 
come on celtic score üí∑üí∑
" you should support celtic because they are a scottish team playing in the cl " fuck off
i bet cov to win , celtic to win , carlisle to draw lol shit gambler .
oops celtic
great to see kaka score , what a legend 
celtic fans calling for lennon's head last year he was " god " use not realise use have just been found out üò±
you can hear the milan coach shout at his players . fair to say the quietest home crowd ever heard in a glasgow football stadia . 
ac milan 3-0 celtic !!!
celtic 3-0 down but signing like they are 6-0 up 
if we become independent , celtic will be the best football club in the country . if we don't they'll still be the best club in the country
good to see celtic park full for the last time this season üòÇüòÇüá¨üáß
" ac milan are a top team " ... they're 13th in serie a and haven't won in the last five .
i belong to milan
got liverpool fans proper trying to call celtic shite cuz were probably out of cl least we was in it you scouse bastard !
he's not " celtic class ".
acca is game over but celtic getting bummed more than makes up for it .
milan day
arsenal , ac milan & dortmund all winning . just waiting on chelsea for a few quid ... not a chance they'll score a late winner ! 
celtic fans are the easiest bunch to wind up on here !!!! bite like fuck
we are rangers super rangers no one likes we don't care we hate celtic fenian basted and we will chase them everywhere
her & milan can get my last if ever needed ‚úîüíØ
celtic played rubbish what a joke lol
celtic make it 7-3 lubo moravcik gets his hattrick with a scorpion kick from the edge of the penalty area .
canny wait for the 15th . celtic away followed by primal scream at secc
watching this celtic side play in europe is starting to make me despondent . i remember feeling all day a game at paradise was a def . win
celtic level with a kaka applaud
nice the celtic fans applaud kaka as he is subbed √† 
good to see applauding the celtic fans 
disappointing to see celtic under performing at home , much needed coefficient points at stake for scottish football . 
 0-3 ultimo cambio out in 
in my view celtic have never replace stuart slater or roddy mcdonald
would prefer to play a solid rm rather than a guy who's only skill is pace over 4yards ! 
rangers fans with " foza milan " tweets , wont be saying that when you play them . oh wait .... 
ac milan sub off kaka on comes robinho 
celtic are championship level
celtic are well good
celtic are pish , sitting on the bus eating chips and cheese , nae tonic left , quality night ....
not saying celtic need world class players but some decent players wouldn't be much to ask for instead of buying shite after selling class
acmilan tearin celtic apart
celtic live app asking me who my celtic man of the match was .....
last rt ; there you have it .. its not because a cmilan are better or celtic are crap . its because forrest got arrested today hahaha
stop moaning , we made a big profit ... so there !!!! frankly if i was lennon i'd walk away from the bargain bin that is celtic plc
it's always a different story when it comes to champions league 
celtic fans are a joke . supposed best fans in the world is absolute toilet been total tripe all night
what does bobby sands have to do with football or celtic ?
celtic seem to have found a boy called rogic and bringing him on . it may be 3-0 , but it's still game time .
on a scale of 1 to braveheart how brave have been tonight ?
can we expect more of this green brigade debacle at tynecastle on sunday ? embarrassing . 
milan made kaka and mourinho ruined him by not playing but no doubt he is still a quality player 
free kick 20 yards out for celtic &nbsp ;
celtic tonight - dear oh dear oh dear - some of the poorest goals conceded for many a day
great to see rogic coming on for celtic in 80th min vs milan . 
celtic are really good 
celtic done as expected ... worst team in the group so coming last is no surprise ! they can't really complain !
faithful through & through .. üçÄ 
can't believe celtic have lost the champions league so soon after winning it a few weeks ago .
listening to celtic carol . just plain never gets old .
milan destroying celtic but 
milan just hold on we going home !!!!
supporting ac milan for the night so i can see them beat celtic ;) !!!
ah well just not celtics night . not had the feel of one of those magic nights at celtic park from start . sammy & commons poor
milan is owning celtic . 
kaka was superb tonight ! no wonder the celtic fans applauded him of the park !
not wrong there mr smith don't knw which team is worse celtic r milan
need celtic to score ffsss
milan .... de jong balotelli robinho .. city rejects
celtic fans are one of a kind !! faithful through and through !! c'mon you bhoys in green !!!
respect by celtic fans towards kaka . im loving it
i just realized there's a celtic ringfort straight across my estate . imao
i'm disappointed celtic are going out , but i'm actually delighted kaka is back in business !! 
i see the supporters are being faithful through and through by leaving early 
celtic losing 3 nil and milan are shit .
welcome back ac milan 
we can't defend , we can't score , our midfield is either injured or suspended , over to you celtic . any answers ?
hahahah text off my uncle billy ' milan fans singing big jock knew '... üòÇ great craic
good campaign celtic always next season ! up the mighty hoops
love seeing celtic get thrashed . hate the manager so much
with the amount of cash spent on fringe players we could have bought one decent goal scorer and gave homegrown talent a chance . 
classy gesture by the celtic fans to properly applaud kaka's great performance tonight . they know their football in glasgow .
now celtic will take the high ground . " we applauded kaka " cunts
 fans are top class . clapping kaka at 3-0 down , 
ive lost the will to live watching this pish . utter bilge celtic !
it's pretty ironic that i'm supporting milan and ajax tonight ... oh , well
milan's real captain off for roby 
arsenal appear to have done enough without being electric . pity about celtic though 
so ! the magpie superstition theory is full of shit ... still no luck üòè üëä 
now where can celtic find inspiration to come from 0-3 down against ac milan ? 
only a matter of minutes now before much gnashing of teeth & celtic blaming the rest of scottish fitba for their european exit .
milan up 3-0 , its a good day
hope the chelsea game finishes before the celtic one so i can see neils lennons puss at the end .
celtic getting beat , bets are fucked , work the mora . cheers üëé
celtic you're breaking my heart here
now just imagine if milan keep aubameyang on the team
celtic o vs acmilan 3 
if celtic live ask me one more time who my celtic man of the match is phone getting launched
all the celtic fans wanting lennon sacked , clearly haven't got a brain cell between them
celtic fans applaud kaka as he is taken off ! robinho replaces him . 10 mins remaining in the game . 
the results tonight couldn't have been any worse from a celtic point of view .
good .... now napoli can fuck off to oblivion . juve and milan will make it through .
you don't see one celtic fan tweeting about rangers , until rangers fans come out when we're losing
maybe with all the savings on win and goal bonuses we could afford a living wage at celtic .
celtic played balls least the spl's are for about 100000 year 
84 boerrigter's free-kick is deflected wide for a corner . mulgrew takes it but milan head clear .
fucking disgusted with the majority of celtic fans . need to know when to support the team not just when we're winning
fickle fucking celtic fans ha ha . they really thought they were in with a chance ?
viva milano !! üëãüëãüáÆüáπüáÆüáπüáÆüáπüáÆüáπüáÆüáπ
best effort on goal that 2night from celtic , a green laser from the crowd
celtic fans putting a laser in abbiati's eyes . sooooo fair
useless scottish pricks celtic and coventry ... shite ... bet over 
just been one of the nights where celtic could play all night and still not score 
celtic fans are more concerned on the ajax fan than there team losing 3-0 .
mis amores 1'realmadrid 2'atl . nacional 3'chelsea 4'milan 5'borussia
the rangers and celtic fans who talk about each other more than supporting there own club are so annoying makes me what to smash my phone .
kaka play with love for milan .. grazie ricky ...
reckon it was davie provan shining that laser at milan keeper !
celtic's style of play has improved drastically in the last three season's
lets be honest , celtic are pish
get it up you celtic your shite !
celtic fans using a laser on the keeper ? classy .
who scored the 2 other goals for ac milan ??
big game from milan they contradict the expectations 
boerrigter shot deflected wide , corner , cleared . milan come forward
hurry up saturday till i drink ac milan out of my system .
celtic played well milan's tactics spot on ! poor defending for first two goals lack of magic in middle of park poor set pieces ynwa
please milan , fire allegri .
this ref is a fuckin spastic min , milan and celtic make identical tackles , celtic get booked and milan get nothing ...
ok id say nobody saw ac milan doing celtic like this even with home advantage oh
celtic wont even reach europa league now
cunts are shinning lasers in the ac milan keeper
kaka's form for milan has been impressive .
bye bye celtic üëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëã‚úã‚úã‚úãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëã‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úãüëãüëã‚úãüëãüëãüëã‚úã‚úãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëê‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úã
well barcelona is playing like garbage , and milan is actually winning a game . porto needs to pull through though
hahaha celtic fans with the laser pointer
are milan nae meant tae be shite ?
important announcement ; celtic's next champions league match v barcelona , will now be shown on the comedy channel with repeats on dave .
not watched celtic play in well over a year and i have no idea who half of their team is now
arsenal are the team that will top this group and get drawn against ac milan or zenit
celtic fans are amazing infairness ! 
gol at la celtic :(
celtic game with the boys it is ‚ò∫Ô∏è
you've got to wonder why this milan side is so bad given the names in the squad . alright , so there keeper must be 73 , but elsewhere . 
bet milan wish they could play celtic every week lol
you will never find anyone wise enough to know why milan let go of aubameyang .
ac milan are demonstrating that you don't need a great football team if you have good tactics and strong discipline . time's up neil lemon .
celtic have the best fans in the uk hands down
a milan side in ' turmoil ' showed us up at parkhead tonight and reminded us just how little quality we have
celtic are so fucking shit
durante on for hoesen , as ajax look to hold on for a famous win and send it all on the line to the final matchday in milan .
i've never disliked celtic . i just don't particularly like them
celtic fan shining a laser pen into the face of the milan keeper . i blame the amsterdam polis .
celtic and barca are cunts
milan are so average this is one of the poorest performances i've ever seen by celtic
i'd actually like to see a goal . it would benefit me financially and make their crushing home defeat slightly less embarrassing .
if you never go watch celtic or you support them because your " family are from glasgow " any argument you have is invalid
celtic played rubbish the night think they really need a striker
lol so many celtic fans saying they'll beat milan but they're down 3-0 üòÇ
every result went against celtic tonight
a flash of genius from forrester could surely expose this a.c milan defence .
celtic put years on me
celtic have been really unlucky in this game so far tonight but now there luck appears to have changed - they have a corner !!
ladbrokes were offering 22/1 for milan to beat celtic 3-0 tonight . anyone who put that on , fair play .
hearts to beat celtic
watching the celtic game an have to say very impressed by de jong def think he'd be great at united even tho he's an ex city prick !! lol
celtic have been terrible tonight
i love celtic üçÄüçÄüçÄ
a : what's celtic and milan playing ? b : milan's leading 3-0 . a : they're beating celtic ? b : no , they're beating the ref .
looks like the only celtic representation in europe this year are 5 boys locked up in amsterdam 
i love when hearts and hubs fans try and rip celtic , its like they are oblivious to what their teams are as football clubs 
the fact that celtic have one of the hardest groups and people are expecting them to get through is beyond me
yeaaaa !!!! big side milan !!! loving it !!! 
hopefully the celtic defence will be this shambolic next friday
bet most city fans watching v :-)
filth with laser pens on milan keeper there .
nothing to so with the ref and nothing to do with rangers . celtic have simply not been good enough in europe this season .
even though celtic are not good enough , still feel for them .
unlucky celtic always next yearüçÄüíö
ah well , got to take the rough with the smooth i suppose . 
surprised the ref hasn't got the blame of celtic losing yet . üò≥ 
i honestly want rogic to score ! i don't care if he is against milan at the moment .
celtic fan shinning a laser in the milan keepers eyes . they deserve kicking out the competition never mind going out on shitness lol
christ almighty now a laser pen shining in the milan keepers eyes , what is it with celtic fans and milan keepers ? best fans ??
im pretty convinced celtic r oot
can only assume lennon's controller keeps cutting out every time milan have the ball in our half . only explanation for this defending .
juve or roma can have the scudetto i want another milan cl final !! ill retweet this come may .
hahaha celtic you shitty cunts
on a positive front charlie mulgrews quiff us far superior to anything milan has to offer .
shining a laser in the milan keepers eyes just shows how bitter celtic fans are
this football has been terrible tonight !! 
celtic rangers argument could go on for days but at the end of the day a could not give two fucks about rangers
this match is like a walk in the park ... get it ? park ? celtic park ? god i'm hilarious .
milan should activate the uefa song before every game in all the competitions
celtic fans are gonna be at a loose end if they go out of europe since they don't go to any other games . 
fuck off ac milan you greasy italian cunts
and now the greatest fans in the world are flashing laser pens into the milan keepers eyes
gotta love fans , team down 3-0 and you hear them cheering loud . 
celtic are the best team in the world ok .
celtic sing they just can't get enough when they're getting beat 3-0 at home , samerz celtic samerz
really thought celtic would have beat milan tonight
boerrigter , pukki , balde - could celtic not have put that money together to buy one decent player instead ?
hope the ajax fan is ok . fallen from stand . if barca can equalise at celtic could still mathematically qualify still for europa
do not concede celtic !! i want ¬£90
defence awful , obviously , but lack of class and cohesion right through celtic side exposed tonight .
night clubs must be open thats why the ( suspect ) little sex case has been substituted he couldn't get off the pitch quick enough 3-0 milan
naw many in celtic park nw lol
rogic came through the nike academy for celtic
golden boy applauded by fans during substitution . such an amazing personality . such a charisma ! such a professional ! 
what's the celtic score ?
forzaa milan that's a great soccer night !!!
the one time milan need an want barca to win they aren't
celtic woeful & it says it all when the 2strikers we signed in summer dnt take to the pitch !!! we bought a pile of crap ! 
che milan !!! üòçüòçüòç 
celtic getting spanked by a poor milan side .
just didn't turn up is an understatement shockingly bad performance from celtic the need for investment is a must in january 
love celtic , hate aw the players , manager and board .. except lustig . he's nice .
celtic weren't going to get a better chance of beating ac . they've been atrocious in serie a .
no point moaning about the ref , celtic just haven't been good enough , have to be willing to admit it
so the " best fans in the world " are now trying to blind the ac milan keeper with green laser pens . makes you proud to be scottish .
not to worry celtic you will of course have support in europe in the new year , in jail
just flicked over to the celtic game . good 10 mins left and loads of empty seats . best fans in the world ?? 
celtic passing the ball around the middle of the park as if they were the ones 3 goals up .
real shame about celtic , would have loved them to get through to the later stages of the cl ..
tell me celtic fans didn't applaud kaka ?
predicting that the zenit and bucharest games would be dull as hell earns me a little double . shame the celtic one wasn't for the trixie ...
if celtic win i'll instagram a video of me doing the helicopter
celtic are good
can hear the milan fans singing big jock knew üòÇüòÇ fucking brilliant
rapists , paedodphiles , crooked lawyers , terrorist supporting players ! the kind of thing celtic supporters respect ! tgfitw ..... lmfao
the three italian teams ( juve , milan and napoli ) have it really difficult to qualify . the best positioned is milan , but still ... ( 1/3) .
right . laptop mended . * deep sigh * so , what on earth has happened to celtic tonight ?
good to see mario putting celtic to the sword . a thoroughly pleasing scoreline .
milan is kickin ass today !
my uncle martin just said ' celtic couldn't score in a brothel ' hahahahahaha
celtic v milan game was so good !
don't let it be said that there are no celtic fans in europe ... a few of them are still banged up in a jail in amsterdam :d :d
no milan player chop card o_o
milan inarrestabile :d 
celtic ! your fears is here
which their allowed to do , but then don't say when celtic fans tweet back that we're ' obsessed '.
oh y'a milan ! 
to the asshat shining the laser at the goalie : get a life . don't need that nonsense . 
disgusted by amount of celtic fans leaving since 80 minutes mark !!
wow . it's almost funny how bad celtic are .
getting beat like that off milan really highlights how shite celtic are .
poor to see the celtic fans leaving with 7 minutes still left !
milan scores 3-0 is this the turning point ? alegri has 9 lives ? 
deveronvale wouldn't have embarrassed themselves like celtic tonight .
barca about to repeat what happened with celtic , 2-1 loss
celtic need a proper out and out striker
 <3 
just how barcelona gets ac milan when they play at camp nou . yeah barcelona still got it all
lustig on decent celtic player tonight , the rest not looked good enough , still c'mon the celtic hail hail bring on next game !!
if rumours are true , together with the celtic score this could be a carlsberg night
celtic fans in the pub already shouting about conspiracies 
only thing celtic are beating now is the traffic .
is that milan player waving at me , man up ya wee dildo
celtic looking for a centre half ?!
got home now : do you have links for acm goals ? thanks !
let's all laugh at celtic 
i wonder how the sellik fan who shone a laser pen in the milan goalies face was provoked into doing it this time ... 
we are celtic supporters faithful through and through , over and over we will follow you üçÄ‚öΩÔ∏è
0vsacmilan3 although milan is winning this game , i am not impressed by the teams performance .
this has been painful 
milan a 16ans 16annnnnns !! 
if it stays this way at and , it means are entirely out of european club competitions ...
milan a kill side !!
well done brian , players and team . a proud day and the start of a new generation ... 1
milan couldn't win away from home all season , and they go to one of the cauldron of european football and win . 
milan 16 ans seconde ?! serieux , putin i don't wanna live in this world anymore
celtic r like the san marino of football
hoy : gana el milan ( por fin) , y ya tengo the last of us ( por fucking fin )
cant remember the last time milan won 
i like mulgrew but he is a defender . celtic have nothing in the middle of park with him in there and rely on wingers only up to no forward
funny lookin head injury !! 
hate to be a celtic fan
and , milan have been pretty ordinary tonight . celtic has contrived to be worse . this has not been a game worthy of the tourney . 
nobody cares about milan results anymore
i hate everything about celtic
oh , and best to have a striker . one that can score , and a midfielder that can create . 
respect to celtic fans who applaud kaka as he subtituted . .
celtic shouldve spent ¬£6mil+ on a striker this season . the amount of chances we've missed is shocking .
that's celtic out haha ! fuck off you cunts !
milan >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
hopefully after this game we start to play down the celtic park atmosphere as its clear its non existent when we are getting beat .
players celtic fail game today 
still love celtic 
dont understand how stokes even gets a game for celtic , chamakh would be more effective than him
loool " chelsea ... barca ... milan ! football ti ya were mehn !
celtic get beat ...... blame the amsterdam police
i blame my dad ....... he gave us no option in life & has set me up to a life time of disappointment . yet i wouldn't change it . üçÄ
come on celtic just score and win me money üí∂üí∂üí∂ come onnnnn
are some celtic players missing the sponser on the top ??
someone explain to me why the milan players are not being booked for time wasting and being drama queens !
milan's defending is top quality to be fair
just not been celtic's night at all
gutted the tic are out . on the plus side a cool ¬£20million+ banked . roll on next year . 
milan don't even have that good a team
ss4 10:00 to see what a celtic striker looks like
just clicked on wwe monday night raw cause it was right above milan v celtic & realised santino morella should get a call from prandelli
a flash of genius from forrest could surely expose this milan defence .
applauding kaka off the pitch when we are getting pumped just shows how much of a bunch of fannys the majority of celtic fans are .
said this last year as well when celtic were loosing to juventus , why on earth would fans be leaving !? i would never don that if i was there !
celtic fans have to be the most deluded on the planet . lets be fair , who would you rather have on your team , anthony stokes or kaka ?
basel turn it on for the big teams once again ! like a swiss version of celtic
mon te fuck milan gees 4 before a go te bed 
celtic fans showing their class , applauding kak√† as he is substituted / applausi per kak√† dai tifosi scozzesi , che classe ! 
why do some of the celtic jerseys not have magners ?
bye bye 
all celtic fans would rather be watching " i'm a celeb " & amy willerton eating croc cock than watching balotelli hand out this shafting üôà
celtic are bloody awful lol ! 
with the ajax fan falling from the stands i predict lots of " puts football in perspective " tweets from celtic fans .
celtic might as well give up there is nothing they can do to fix this
celtic have let me down for 525 quid :)))))))
hope ajax win milan in the last game
celtic - you'll never walk alone , unless of course they are getting battered then everyone fucks off early !
hope milan go thru n ajax fans aw get killed on a plane
disgusting display by celtic . woeful . out of the champions league .
get that intae ye celtic
celtic fans leavingüòÇüòÇ
all celtic fans are quiet now üëä
a lot if the faithful have dealt with the 0-3 scoreline by disguising themselves as green seats 
fucking abysmal performance from celtic 
probably the worst celtic home performance ever in the champions league 
milan >>>>>>>
get a literal pain in my chest when celtic loses lol the only thing that makes me emotional üò¢
it's about time celtic got a spanking at home 
celtic ...
congratulation to dortmurd's fans , arsenal's fans , ajax's fans and indisputable ac milan's fan for tonight powerful winning 
this is what its like to be celtic this is whats its like to be small , this is what its like when your passports back in the drawer !
next year i hope to see roma milan and juve in cl . none of this napoli or fiorentina or inter bullshit . fuck off
i've looked online but can't find ' samaras total goals during his 5yrs at cfc ,, but i do know he must rank very low as a celtic no9 
free kick celtic 25 yards out
home from work and turn on the football .... oh celtic !!!
omg milan *_* 
the green brigade should recreate what the milan ultras did at the weekend .
im praying for a clean sheet 
celtic can't expect to be playing the level of football that's required in the champions league without having that fight in the spfl 
if celtic had the best supporters in the world why they leaving ?
i'm ready to eat and i wish milan take her ass to sleep
just clicked on wwe monday night raw cause it was right above milan v celtic & realised santino morella should get a call up from prandelli
free kick for celtic 86 ' 0-3
finally , milan sought to build on their lead . they took their chances , and they didn't cower away from the big stage .
a celtic goal please ...
all i see at celtic park right now is a lot of empty seats haha
' whats everyone twitting about celtic nicole ?' üòÇ shhh colette
i think we get its been a great night for milan , thanks for rubbing it in commentator . dickhead !
only arsenal did well today !! nd ac milan !
loving this , bar√ßa losing and milan winning away at celtic ! 
any my twitter switch-off begins in three , two , one .... 
celtic fans seeming annoyed tonight ? was it really that bad ? or just out classed by milan ?
dear milan and real madrid . i'm fully convinced kaka can play the full 90 min . why be such a bitch ? with the best wishes ..
celtic now praying for a barca goal to keep them in the europa league ! ahahahaha
celtic are fucking shite !! Ûæì¥Ûæì¥
rogic replaces forrest for celtic , while robinho comes on for kaka for milan . well , different leagues ... 
tbh celtic had no chance
robhnio you are a shocker , waving arms around like its a compound fracture . then gives it a shrug & walks off pitch 
celtic 0-3 the most average milan team in history
i'll only like celtic when they play newco
celtic getting crushed 0-3 by milan
what a shame bout the celtic score ! 
" we won't underestimate milan " said lennon . where to even start with this delusion ? :d
sad whenever celtic are losing some of there fans need to bring up rangers ! 
celtic fans leaving the ground as fast as they do in riverside at rovers üòÜüòÜ 
well celtic i can think of a few things i could have spent my ¬£28 on other than this 
having been to one celtic game -and loving it- i want to go to another in december . someone advise me i'm a football noob ! ( basketball . 1 )
my night can't get any worse , celtic app is pestering me for a mom vote piss off .
barca getting beat , chelsea getting beat , only highlight a have the night is celtic getting beat
celtic were shite tonight but the ref being a wank doesn't help
something is wrong today ! barca losing and milan winning xd
has led his celtic team to the double after a great season for the club . 13
y'a milan 
celtic = 90 minutes not 70/80 !! disgraceful ..
a lot of the faithful have dealt with the 0-3 scoreline by disguising themselves as green seats 
unacceptable celtic sign duds you get performances to match , gutted
for the second year in a row , celtic lose to an italian team 3-0 at home and 2-0 away . bow down .
 
poor celtic i'am sure the whole of scotland is devastated for you 
basel lead , ajax lead , zapata goal , milan 2 set pieces goal 
it's funny cause i don't even support celtic
about time celtic got spanked at home 
not too many tonight covered themselves in glory , very very poor 
milan finally a win a match ... that's good
celtic's failure is ultimately down to horrendous defending at set pieces , and lack of any threat for attacking set pieces ...... üëé
nothing makes me think that chelsea are ready for two legs with milan or bayern better than losing a double to basel .
i never channel hop when watching but tonight's a first !! 
that's why i support celtic !! the best support on earth !!!! we gave the italians a game again today . born one die one !!!
according to police reports that ajax fan jumped out of the way of a carlsberg tin thrown from celtic fans
hate seeing celtic fans leave early ! faithful through and through ?
its sad to see celtic go to barca and get slaughterd again hahah
wonder if this barca team will be the same when they play us !? 
ac milan must be wishing they had to play the champions every week ..
most disappointing ucl game i've ever been to . credit to milan defence though , zapata was solid
if you'd like to stop tweeting about celtic that would be appreciated ! my timelines been full off it aw night , just stop now ‚úã
mulgrew shot saved , milan come forward , lost it , ambrose to ledley as we come forward
over and over 
please score celtic
basel 1-0 chelsea 7fold 11/14 time running out chelsea , celtic and coventry needed 
scott brown's stupidity against barcelona on matchday two indirectly cost celtic the chance of a place in the knockout stage . discuss .
if i was a celtic fan , i'd be fucking raging at the moment . all these strikers they signed , none deemed good enough to start tonight .
ima shock acmilan beat celtic at home man like woooowwwwwwwww .
seen a running theme when champions league comes around , celtic lose every man and his dog sparks up , they win , diddly squat 
milan <3 
milan *__* 
can we laugh at glasgow celtic ?
nialls list for maga : cones , bibs , boots , celtic strip
can't believe celtic have lost the champions league so soon after winning it a few weeks ago . ‚Äù
now the last game between milan and ajax goin be do or die for both sides
if ajax beats milan in the final match of the group , milan's out , while napoli needs to win and hope borussia doesn't ... ( 2/3) .
milan performing well in champion league against celtic n doing worse in serie a . wonders !: -)
everyone blame my dad for this defeat ! did a blind bet and bet celtic and ajax to win .........
well this proves just how average celtic really are ! milan couldnt beat a team down to 9 men at the weekend !
celtic fans applauding ricky . a standing ovation , and songs for you in the rivals ‚Äô stadium . now that‚Äôs something ! -ilma-
there's nothing to be shame of , but it's dissapointing when sometimes fans give more than players . i ‚ô• !
get us a wee goal celticüòî
the way celtic have played throughout this whole campaign we're lucky to come 4th
milan omg <3
the amount of celtic fans left already bit of a joke to claim to be the ' best fans in the world '
nothing but pure hate for celtic
i was always hoping for kaka to come back to milan and my wish came true
 trop trop fort
fire , football and celtic and getting humped üëç
still time for a person , not necessarily a fan , to run in and assault the milan keeper .
keep the faith 
not good enough from . spent 8.5 mill on pukki , derk and balde .... haven't spent wisely . not replaced like with like from last season
oft !! celtic game is off i'm off to bed !!! and shocking celtic eyes were hardly on the ball second half 
get in there the old basil brush !!!! üòÇ‚öΩÔ∏è perfect night with the gooners beating the frogs and the milan pumping the shelick !! 
browsing ebay for vintage meakin and hornsea stuff while watching celtic get gubbed . thrilling stuff :-) ( the browsing not the celtic game .. )
i cant believe celtic are getting beat 3 at home fs bets chinned
milan news to be gettin results like this week in week out if they're going to be playing in cl next year .. not good enough so far
no even an excuse for celtic the night they were absolute shocking .
well done celtic , great effort
wow some celtic fans have absolutly no logic
milan *____* 
amazing 
love how my mum dad and brother won't let me in the livingroom cause they're watching the celtic gameüò≠

milan >>>>>>>
as soon as i applaud the celtic fans they start leaving and shining lasers in the keeper's face . still making good noise 
chelsea marseille and celtic to score and i've won some pennies
i hate the old firm but why do rangers fans slag celtic . do they watch there rival team ? or just pray for failure . they make football boring
celtic should sign me i'll score everything for them lol
very poor from celtic tonight , expect a lot better from our team !!
ref was pish celtic were pish
it is now started before christmas with christmas tree formation . forza milan !
gutted for celtic theyve played well but not got results ! stokes is boss ! should of started not come on 65 mins in !
89 ambrose tries to force his way through the milan defence . the ball breaks for samaras but he's flagged for offside .
i wanna see milan game kmt whattttt chaannneellll lol
berlusconi must not be fooled by this victory . celtic's defence was generous . this squad needs some investing in . 
lets go ac milan 
come on basel and ajax you can do it . wish celtic for a result though
i thought everyone said that celtic would get a result tonight ......... i very good 
milan >>>>>> 
at least i don't have to cancel anymore of my 7 a side with celtic gettin pumped out the cl ! every cloud and all that !
milan has shown a lot of teams how to win comfortably at celtic park .
having a chuckle at celtic .... lol
you may not score today samaras & celtic !
it's only cos celtic are so shit that abiate hasn't conceded cos he is a wank keeper !
celtic are bad for offsides

abbiati has dominated the box for milan tonight
" oh rangers fans coming out the woodwork , good night in arbroath aye ?" " haha celtic losing to ac " go and drown you fucking cretins .

brilliant text from my dad ....." every time i go to another game , milan score . it's magic "
thought celtic would get a result tonight tbh
wish the banny training had been on now so i didn't have to see this game üôà shocking performance from celtic !
aw well celtic are getting pumped am sound
celtic scotland's embarrassment on and off the pitch !
saying that , barce should beat celtic . just .
celtic are the offside kings of tonight ! 
celtic's back 4 tonight - rory bremner , rory bremner , rory bremner and rory bremner . 
i've got all kinds of love for ac milan but i'd much rather see ajax go through to the ko's way they're playing
mazy dribble from efe . flicks to samaras swho shoots . saved ! but its offside anyway . last minute ... 3-0 milan
asif a ajax fan has fallen 30 ft in the celtic game celebrating !!
wit the fuck have sevco got to do with a celtic cl game ?
getting a bit emotional watching this milan and celtic game seeing de jong , balotelli , robinho and samaras
celtic get paid thousands every week but they can't keep their fans in the stadium ? no getting enough money or something to play decent
celtic losing :(
alegri's really showing zany excellent performance tonight against celtic !
at the end of the day , we were put in the group of death and to not have lost a game by double figures is an achievement in itself 
classy touch by the celtic supporters as they roundly applaud the wonderful kaka as he's substituted with his milan team cruising .
celtic now prepare for next home game by getting the flags ready for the empty seats
celtic are getting hammered god
really hope we beat celtic this year
fair enough , the performances against barca and ajax were superb . but bar that , celtic thoroughly deserve to finish bottom of the group .
has the milan goalie got 5 stars tattooed on his arm ? :d
wonder if that lassie from ireland will do another video when celtic get beat
raging about losing to a team like ac milan proves how far a head we are of the rangers ! that club can only dream of night like this ....
very poor celtic !
great win for milan vs celtic . much needed considering domestic league woes !
unlucky celtic !
davie the third goal from milan got them off their seats and away !
watching celtic game with mum & dad , on italian sky sports , commentary is great , camera went onto lennon , commentator's reaction ," oh , mama mia "
dortmund's spirit , milan's return .. and now even basel is fucking chelsea in the ass again , i can honestly say this is a good night xdd
glad to see all the celtic fans stayed to the end . faithful through and through üòÜ .
nae european football for celtic then
celtic need to but decent players 
tonight just proves that celtic need to start spending money
lennon is going to have something to say about all this 
ac milan are tanking celtic tonight ‚Äî 3-0 . come on !!!!
jel of my uncle going to the celtic bar√ßa game in the celtic end
raiging at celtic !!
interesting night in the champions league celtic 0-3 ac milan ajax 2-1 barcelona don't even think celtic will make europa league üëãüëãüáÆüáπüáÆüáπüáÆüáπ
oh celtic celtic that's the team for me !
thought celtic played well tonight ... üòÇüòÇ 
abbati is a great keeper 
the celtic coach looks like carrot top
be shit for a celtic fan , when they go the nou camp , no messi , probably put the youngsters out .
between school work , feeling unwell , my braces & celtic ... i am very stressed out ! i need vodka
great chance from celtic . samaras has a shot but well blocked by abbiati 
basel dnb , dortmund , milan and barca . annoying !
tattoos i still want to get : double bow & arrow , deathly hallows , yellow rose , a rune , a celtic knot moon/star
up eh road celtic 
only celtic player capable of taking the ball past a man is ambrose ... no where near good enough .
hate the milan keeper how every time he makes a save he celebrates . 
celtic fans gave kaka a round of applause as he got subbed . he's still top class x
celtic supporters faithful through and through hail hail
milan if you're gonna come at 2 , come dressed cause ima go to vg with kev .
i love the celtic bias on tv .. of course they are always unlucky . . they deserved better .. ha
regardless of rangers ' current position and financial state . i still get a kick from celtic getting pumped 
celtic and bradford have fucked me over for 525 . sickener .
dutch police have declared the ajax fan fell as a result of a brick thrown at them from celtic park .
celtic supporters faithful through and through so why are you all leaving
so who's turn is it tonight to get the blame for celtic getting beat ?
dinna agree with fellow celtic fans being happy about the ajax cunt who fell from the terrace .. he's definitely maybe a cunt , but too far .
ya can say what ya like about referees in the european champions league but to be fair they really are shit . 
ac milan in champions league like a lion !!!
that's the worst performance i've seen from celtic in a long time 
jock stein manager of celtic !
i think celtic got pumped on purpose ! trying to deflect from the important stuff ! why does forrest get his dick out ?!! fans need the 
great to see basel beating chelsea and celtic getting hammered !
never heard celtic park so flat on a european night . we'v went out with a whimper . no excuses tonight lennon .
watching celtic is a bit like watching cricket
van dijk = ¬£ 2.6 m derk boerrigter=¬£ 3.0 m watching them get pumped 3-0 at home off a.c milan= priceless for everything else there's master card
tom rogic only gets a run when celtic are 3-0 down with ten minutes to go . shows where he is in the pecking order , needs a move asap .
our best and most threatening player going forward has been ambrose ... a fucking centre back 
respect 
was waiting on chelsea , but who cares celtic is out üëåüòÇ
milan >>>>>>>>>>>> 
hajar celtic !! 0-3
essentially , is out and are in . have to just win each game they play now , and they're through . it's copenhagen and gala
celtic have been poor , yes , but this ' poor ' milan side have been impressive all over the park .
tell me again how celtic are the best team in the world
celtic the greatest fans in the world r leaving early , it must b a optical illusion they couldn't do that
chelsea and celtic getting beat , brilliant . if only arsenal had of to . there will be a lot of empty seats next match 
milan have a ¬£30 million rated player upfront . we had commons .
worst performance a hink av ever seen from celtic , put james forrest in the jail
celtic just aren't good enough . 3-0 down to a really average milan team , new signings are seriously needed
awful result for celtic
and ac milan are going to beat celtic
well you fucked up there celtic ....
all the admin people on celtic pages are thick as fuck man , annoy me so much its unreal !
don't know wot went wrong tonight , but if i knew that i wud b their manager !! hh x
celtic haven't been good enough ! tonight or at all in this group !!
celtic fans magnificent ! now the board should provide us with a team worthy of our support . 
let's all laugh at celtic , let's all laugh at celtic !
winner takes all in round 6 when a.c milan play ajax amsterdam !
wow celtic getting punished at home
nan " celtic wouldnt score a goal if the keeper sat on an armchair besides the goals " 95 
hope rangers get celtic in the cup
celtic park 2.0
barca getting beat , celtic are missing the chance of last 16 
hopefully scott brown is reflecting on how he shouldn't have been so petulant against barcelona . he's been missed big time v ajax and milan .
milan *_* üòçüëè 
yees ac-milan yo gat this .
ac milan battering celtic 3-0 !!!
three added minutes at celtic park .
let's all laugh at celtic hahahaha
celtic badly need scott brown
not heard anyone blaming scott brown yet for a celtic defeat . ach , the night is still young .
out of europe before christmas .. exactly what we deserve .. 
thank you ‚ô°
scott brown needs to learn to keep his cool . celtic coulda done with him these last few games
celtic never have a plan b . i'm sorry lennon but what other tactics , if any , can you offer ?
i got basel and milan buzzing on my list . napoli let me down 
celtic are best fans in the world , especially on european nights . that's why it's half empty on 85 minutes .
take it the celtic players just sit and read their headlines at training ? cause it's the same pish every week in defence ?
there's the celtic fans there 
 have been decent in the 2nd half . carried out everything as needed . much improved . just haven't got what's necessary in .
barca , napoli and chelsea losing while milan is winning ! what a round in 
great fans 
come home to find acm winning 3-0 and bvb winning 3-1 . so happy :')
 = belle performance 
win , lose or draw - celtic forever 
powder puff performance tonight by a poor celtic ! league should be wrapped up by christmas and start looking at quality additions .
i love how supporters of other teams live for celtic to lose . it's actually quite sad you know 
milan , just perfect . 
watch milan lose to ajax next match lol
celtic are in this weird limbo . way too good for the spfl , not good enough for europe . lack of decent signings caught up with them .
just turned on the celtic gameüò≠
scottish announcer asking what happened . milan happened . we are the champions league ! not dundee united !!!!!!! -gc
celtic can get to fuck . costing me on my bet üò≠
being beat and still singing proudly and loudly 
celtic fans still singing whilst losing 3-0 ... good to see
i can't believe i'm cheering for barca today :) anything for milan !
90 + 3 menit ' celtic 0 - 3 milan .
celtic park now looks like it does on a saturday for league games .
milan finally won after 7 games
are fans singing to support their team , or because they're drunk lol 
celtic fans showing their hobo roots . 3-0 down in glasgow and singing for the first time in injury time .
balotelli gol , milan 3-0 celtic
kaka ' it's going to be a hard game against celtic '. ' ko fs lol '
one thing no celtic fan deny is that the rest of the season is going to be pretty dull without european football .
celtic need to get some decent players in poor show tonight bhoys 
celtic fans are the best in the world üçÄ
ye go through every bloody emotion supporting celtic manüò≠üçÄ
c'mon celtic you can still win this one !!
ac milan a mis un tarif a celtic glasgow 3-0 .
goodnight celtic 
goosebumps at our singing !! god bless celtic !! üçÄüçÄ
pure fucking pish celtic ! utterly inept in every respect . not even good enough for europa league . supporters deserve better than this crap !
ac milan have played so well today , defending and attacking , i've seen a completely different side to the team today .
amazing celtic fans . 
kaka put on a master show even celtic fans clapped him off , great to see old kaka back , quality player . üëç
" we are celtic supporters faithful through & through ." when you see this you know we are playing fucking shite ! 
i love celtic win lose or draw
up celtic
ah so chelsea , barca , celtic and porto all getting beat/drawing . my fault . 
absolutely love being a celtic fan , all the highs and low of football , just can't beat it üçÄüçÄüçÄ
the cl run last year was used as an excuse for our poor league form , what will be the excuse this year ? 
this is just great . beat ajax at san siro and hope celtic beat uefalona too . finish the league with most no . of points . 
i've flooded the kitchen my mums deep with me , celtic lost so my boyfriend will be deep too , certainly no having a good time of it tonight üôà
unless you support a club in the champions league your jokes about celtic are pointless and make you look petty and stupid 
celtic fans singing till the last , best fans in the world showing why we are the best .
well celtic are out of the champions league . not the worst run but couldn't expect more tbh . well done ! 
celtic need a new striker , no goal scorers in this team at all
still singing though 
and people thought celtic would winüòÇ
aaaww the celtic fans .
so many celtic fans leaving parkhead early now that it resembles their average league game . 
never heard celtic fans singing so loudly when we are 3-0 down . the atmoshpere here is better than at parkhead ! 
chelsea is losing !! arsenal won ! milan are winning 3-0 ! & ajax are winning !
well that's celtic out the champions league then
best thing about the nights game was watching kaka in the first half ... rest of the game and celtic have been garbage ! 
simple as , celtic aren't good enough 
time for a change at celtic ?
90 ' 3 minutes injury time/3 minuti di recupero 0-3
2-0 - over marseille , 3-0 over celtic and 3-1 over napoli ... quality football day around the world
laughing at celtic fans singing and having a good time and theres loosing 3-0 ...
celtic have the best fans in the world no doubt
the hip new religion of wo de baobe has been spread to weed is okay here , milan , and o r a n g e s
provan " give celtic fans something to get of their seats "...... it appears they already have ....
thanks milan , forza milan !!!
celtic have some quality fans , id rather they go through than barca , even if its impossible
top class by the celtic fans
celtic park still singing away !! best fans in the world ! 3-0 down place still buzzing !!!
arsenal and milan winning + wilshere and kaka scored . awesome day 5
you's still sung really well celtic fans , i didn't think you's talked about results ? 
whatever i don't care we qualified and celtic got fucked up , cunts
celtics no last seasons side !! boerrigter shit , pukki shit , ambrose shit ! celtic need new players don't care what anyone says
i feel like barca are doing this on purpose . they just don't wanna see milan prosper . now score , you idiots !
this land was made for you and me- celtic fans
celtic deserve to score at least one smh
pre madonna bastards . spl title covers the cracks of european football . milan fans block players in entrance , we sing about our rivals .
dinna see what celtic have to sing about , they're down 3-0 and out of europe basically
celtic a love ye but ye cause me some amount of stress at times
celtic played well just a pity a lot of the decisions went against us tonight 
celtic fans are truly incredible . still chanting after 3-0 defeat . 
wanna know a joke celtic
wow ! celtic fans !
barca is losing milan is winning i'm mindfucked
celtic with a half full stadium , on our way out of europe and 3-0 down still singing loud and proud üëåüëè
so the only thing celtic left in europe this year now is there fans in jail ......
milan thoughüëåüëåüëå
a very poor milan team but still manage to beat celtic
20000 celtic fans saying goodbye to parkheed for another season as they only go to euro games
definitely not our night 
another harsh european lesson learned by celtic hopfully . can't rely on what we've got 
classy touch by the celtic supporters as they roundly applaud the wonderful kaka as he's substituted 
glasgow warriors skelped , scotland skelped , celtic skelped . it's only tuesday .
some disgusting celtic supporters on here as well , saying too good for that unfortunate ajax fan ... and they call themselves fans !? 
celtic fans are just amazing proud to be a supporter
found 11 cunts at celtic park who don't deserve the living wage
celtic were so good tonight thoughüò§ don't know how they bet us ..
we are celtic 
zonal marking is a waste of time . man marking all the way . if he goes for a pish , you go for a pish . 
schoolboy defending , taught a lesson by average milan side , poor show ! well done the bhoys still there & singing away ! 
this is just great . beat ajax at san siro and hope celtic beat uefalona too . finish the group with most no . of points . 
ajax's win means : we need to win bright-side : if celtic win and milan win .. we get 1st
che cuore i tifosi del celtic‚ù§Ô∏è 
celtic fans still singing even when there are losing 0-3 
celtic through and through ! well be back bigger and stronger next year
at least the celtic fans put in a fine performance as ever 
milan >>>>>>>>>>> 
we played shite but support like that doesn't come wi any of the shitey soulless clubs around these days . makes you proud . 
still love celtic , faithful through and through üçÄ
milan have the cigars out . celtic well out their depth .
celtic fans still support their team . amazing they are
the only reason y anyone should want to go and c a celtic game is to sing the fields of anthenry ! bad outfit !
are you happy milan fans ? now you'll have to stand allegri for other 4 months to say the least
fuck the co-efficient . delighted celtic are out . that barca match was a very , very long time ago .
nice to see celtic ending up where they belong ....
would like to know the last time celtic were beaten 3-0 at home !!! 
could watch celtic get a good auld shagging all dayüòÇ
not seeing many celtic fans on twitter tonight ? whats going on ? #0 -3
for all the plaudits celtic have got for value signings on past , it sure looks like a huge bag of duds they‚Äôve wasted cash on in past year
bloody awful celtic .
barca fixed this game for ajax to win . ajax vs milan , there's gonna b some controversy in that match i guarantee it 
why are celtic fans bow singing about a free derry ? cringe and embarrassing springs to mind
91 ' 0-3 : just waiting for the whistle . 
barcelona losing to ajax might be good for us tho . if we beat ajax at san siro and celtic beat barcelona ( lol ) we get first place ! 
poor celtic coulda shoulda woulda :/
celtic have been so poor this season in the champions league
my motm in the celtic v ac milan game is the referee !! did not bow down with pressure from the sellick fans !! 
exceptional cl night , perfect results arsenal 2-0 marseille ajax 2-1 barcelona celtic 0-3 ac milan arsenal , ajax and ac milan for life .
i don't like celtic because of how violent they are
 chelsea losing ... barca losing and funny enough ac milan is winning . lmao .
heart bleeds for celtic 
where are all the great loyal faithful celtic fans going ??? leaving early tut tut games not finished yet part time supporters 
ask lennon why he would stay at celtic . surely he has a brain and quits . no point for the season now
no one moving of the ball players just walking about waiting for the ball to drop at there feet shocking display from a celtic team .
ac milan beats celtic woop woop 
 fans supposed to be good ?! empty seats all over ! can't even sell out for champions league games !
so happy that celtic lost , ac milan played brilliant
what was that celtic ? you were gonna beat milan ? hahahahahahahaha ! peasants .
let's all laugh at celtic , na na na na !
great win for milan !
oh the celtic are shite
come on celtic !!!!
celtic 0 juventus 3 lessons learned zero . you can't play an open game against italian teams .
awww does my tits in when celtic try and say they have the best fans in the world
priiiit welcome new round ! forza milan
and celtic fans keep singing even though their team is behind , for them
wins for arsenal milan an ajax have made my night nae bheasts in europe efter xmas hahaha get it right up yeez ya mhanky bheasty mugs 
good win for milan üëç
just wish odhran downey would realise how bad celtic are
not today celtic better luck next time ! 
what's the bet celtic go and beat barcelona at the noucamp now that they're out !?!?
barcelona and chelsea losing . milan and arsenal winning . an rt from them as well . good way to start the day !
been another good experience for celtic in the champions league , but just weren't up to it this time round across all the games
celtic out of the champions league ugh so annoyed hate milan
celtic can have few complaints tonight . defended like a pub team and play in final third wasn't much better .
nice to hear the celtic fans still singing away 
damn you celtic
well it's clear milan change nothing after this result . transfer policy at optimum , allegri is sacchi incarnate , galliani the bald totem
thank fuck ac milan were in disarray prior to tonights game or it could have been a disaster .
if this is a poor milan side id fucking hate to see a good 1 
kaka never seems to disappoint since he's come back to 
as long as milan beats ajax next game and bar√ßa beats celtic then they'll make it to the round of 16
celtic are shite aren't they
seems someone's told the celtic fans they don't have to wait until they're winning before singing 
superbe match milan !! 3-0 foza rossoneri ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
i don't think celtic should really expect much , they are never going to get far in this competition , no where near good enough .
my boy kaka scoring the opening and game winning goal in the milan game today ! 
celtic and chelsea were such disappointments üò≠‚úä
hurts me to see lose . but kaka and balotelli scored so its forgivable today
celtic fans incredible as usual most of this team don't deserve to play on the turf of paradise 
fuck milan ! 
worst milan team in 50 years they said
great support till the end . well done celtic . europe will be a quieter place without us after christmas .
i'll take that . gonna be an edgy game in naples . i see chelsea are losing to basle . ac r pumping celtic . suck it in lennon . i love the 
get rid of the scottish league and fuck celtic into the championship
celtic fans must be heading home now surely ?. 3-0 to ac milan !!! more goals to come :-)
chelsea get beat , celtic get beat ! just one of those champions league nights you love <3
it's the real ac milan
looks like milan play better in cl than serie a .
ah well . at least we can concentrate on the league now :/ 
good to see celtic fans standing by there team till the end , oh wait that's a half empty stadium , never walk alone my arse haha
ac milan 3 points in the bag !
i reckon rangers would turn over celtic after tonight shocking performance ...
we played brilliantly away at milan and home against ajax and barca . unfortunately we have suffered from a lack of real quality
celtic need to get through three more minutes of injury time before a miserable night is over for them .
50,000 still at celtic park . back at work in 11 hours . paying for this . choobs on the field will get up when they want and maybe saunter in .
anyone else seen the photo of the milan fan that fell 4 metres from the stand into concrete . sincerely hope he's alright but it looks bad
full time : basel 1-0 chelsea | celtic 0-3 milan | porto 1-1 austria wien | steaua 0-0 schalke | 
final result , celtic 0 - milan 3 . finally . 
hopeless and soapless . celtic fc
i'd rather get done 3-0 by milan than any of the other teams in the spl
aye the celtic game was quite good lol
might have found the winner here : group h 2007 : milan , lille , athens , anderlecht
milan dans incroyable talent >>>>
get out celtic
could be worse ye could be a dirty ajax scumbag up the celtic :)
celtic let me down 855 pound . all i asked for was one goal .
ft : celtic glasgow 0-3 ac milan 
celtic will be back next season !
not fucking good enough !! 
salute to the glasgow celtic fans who still singing and supporting the team ... 
goal !!! guess itz game over as mario balotelli hits the back of the net for ac milan .. its milan 3-0 celtic .. 
celtic were the better team tonightüòû soooo unlucky
93rd minute 3-0 down and yet the signing hasn't stopped .. what a group of supporters ! 
75 mins still castlebar celtic 0 - 3 galway wfc
tough night for fans . had every right to leave at 70 ' but majority chose to stay until the end . dedication . 
celtic fans showing what it means to support their team , even when they're down . what an atmosphere . 
you can always count on celtic to help make up the numbers 
we've just been embarrassed by an embarrassingly bad ac milan team . embarrassing .
not even thursday night against athletico kebab now ffs . . 
pretty poor this season in champions league but i'm sure we'll give it another go next year ! 
feels like the board took " we don't care if we win , lose or draw " a little too literally . not class anymore .
poor performance celtic . peter lawell get ur finger out and start spending money u big prick
celtic crowd back to their usual size now !
fuck chelsea fuck celtic fuck barca fuck coupons fuck rochdale fuck chesterfield
so no coming back from 3-0 in the next minute , i'm guessing 
think a lot of people have got trains to get and buses not everyone can walk to celtic park
ac milan vexed today tho
3-0 milan full time . celtic not good enough defensively or mentally . composure and first touch once again lacking 
i feel sad for celtic and the fans . 
so ac milan will top group h , and ajax amsterdam will remain on 3rd position due to fc barcelona having a better goal difference . tight call .
ac milan 3-0 celtic .
celtic fans leaving early are all wanks .
milan win 0-3 at celtic park . huge result for milan . 
i'm having a hard time tryna decide who's worse ... samaras for celtic , or bendtner for arsenal ?!....
still the best fans in the world 
ft 3-0 milan . no redeeming features to that at all .
fulltime : 3 in celtics stadium
ft celtic 0-3 ac milan , and so ends celtic's hopes in the champions league . 
we're celtic supporters , faithful through and throughüçÄüíö
absolute shite celtic
bad night for celtic . sex pest in their team . terrorist banners in the stands and beaten by a poor milan side !
seriously brave stuff from celtic
waiting on a goal from celtic , useless twats
celtic outta europe but wigan are still in europe ....
wisnae see milan fans singing and clapping if their team just got pumped 3-0 ! typical scottish mentality ! lot of pish !
ft : celtic 0-3 milan !! finally we won , kaka was the motm , the team showed spirit !! 
so wait ... celtic fans , you're telling me you're supposed to rally around your team when they're down ? huh .... 
full time : celtic 0-3 ac milan
still faithful through and through 
celtic couldn't mark a 2 year old baby with a spanking paddle ! and samaras you leave them over head kicks to steven jackson !
milan's best performance of the season , by far . did it ever come at the right time . but is it just the eye of the storm or the clearing ?
celtic - 19:45 : we can qualify !!! 21:35 : out of europe completely .
architects of their own downfall celtic . sunday lge defending coupled with inability to take chances .. had more shots on target than milan !
i really did think celtic would of score tonight , not impressed
there's always next year 
there's always next year , . 
celtic will forever , in my eyes , be a subservient species of copy-cat , thieving , rat scum . 
fair play milan 
look at our players ... still giving thr 100% . even we are through n would top tge table by beating celtic but i love u barca !
:-) hahahaha its no that tae , ac milan have been absolutely fuckin dot cotton lol
 record in champions league in 2013 : p7 l7 , failed to score in six of the seven games . ouch .
we are celtic supporters faithful through and through
classy touch by the celtic supporters as they roundly applaud the wonderful kaka as he's substituted 
it's bad enough when celtic lose but the worst thing is the support ripping into each other over thing both great and small .
this has been very painful to watch . \very poor by celtic
nooo celtic out
awe well it wasn't to be this year celtic , we will be back next year and much stronger i hope üçÄüçÄ 
foooorrrzaaaa miilllaaaaan 3-0 against celtic in celtic park great win
fans still singing , credit to them as i know i wouldn't be after this performance tonight , maybe the gb should do what milan ultras did . ;-)
lovely job from my boys tonight ! we destroyed celtic in their own backyard . 
ft : ajax 2-1 barcelona . superb . deserved . tough 2nd half . bar√ßa lethargic . if ajax beat milan , they're through . superb performance .
full-time : celtic 0 milan 3
celtic fans arguing amongst themselves hahaha

we are celtic supporters faithful through and through over and over we will follow you
another terrific performance from a serie a team at park . reason why i'd rather watch italian football over spanish every time .
there are many great celtic songs . over and over isn't one of them .
milan would be nowhere atm if they hadn't got kaka back . the guys a genius
ft ' celtic 0-3 milan #3point yeahhh * prokk prokk prokk *
 all losers today ! 
awful performance by celtic
 out of europe before november . rather funny it comes on the same day as independence plans are announced .
all over at celtic park . 
f/t : 0-3 . , and with the goals . a much needed win for milan who looked very good throughout . 
milan vince 3a0 e batte il celtic 
celtic v milan 0-3 final . top players : balotelli , kak√† , zapata , bonera & poli ( can play right back defense all the time) . a perfect milan .
just flicked over to see milan pumping some irish club . the ground looks as full as ever . 
" we will take 2 or 3 off this mob " i was told today . naw ye willnae " i said 
ah well , least celtic get champions league football unlike some teams ...
well played celtic
milan win 3-0 against celtic
celtic got best 3-0 :)
unlucky celtic 
full time celtic vs milan 0-3 . grande .. grande !!!!
ft celtic 0 - 3 ac milan ... good job guys ... 
scary how shit ac milan are now , 1st away win all season hahaha . 
this is 3rd home loss ever , the other 2 were against barcelona ( 3-1 on 04/05 & 1-0 this season ) 
the saying " you get what you paid for " applies in the soccer transfer market too ... complete lack of ambition from the celtic board .
celtic would have struggled to beat st mirren playing like that 
gubbed 3-0 at home & 2-0 away in the champs league , milan have done to celtic exactly what celtic did to cliftonville . 
not good enough . shite performance 
full-time : ajax 2 barcelona 1 . celtic are out of europe .
final . celtic 0 - milan 3 . 
over and over we will follow you 
arsenal win , chelsea flopping and celtic are out ... good times
full time ! celtic 0 - 3 ac milan
celtic crowd were horrible tonight
slow , painful champions league death for celtic .
ahh well - that's our treble hopes over then . 
all the fake fans leaving the stadium eventhough celtic's getting hammered and the proper fans singing their way out of the champions league
ft : celtic 0-3 milan . kaka , zapata & balotelli goals do the job . big result given such lacklustre form leading into this .
well done ac milan .
told you's milan were pish
well thats twice in a row now , celtic play an italian team , lost 3-0 at home , 2-0 away 
balotelli giving celtic fans the fingers !! 
we're all celtic supporters , faithful through and through , over and over we will follow you ....
we are celtic supporters faithful through and through .
final score : ac milan 3-0 ajax
well done milan üëè
glasgow's east end republican terrorists 0 ac milan 3 
great win . forza milan !!
we are celtic supporters , faithful through and through , over and over we will follow you üëèüçÄ
had celtic to lose 3-1 , silly bet should of known they weren't good enough to score !
great game by milan this is what i expect from them every week
victory 0-3 doei celtic
we are celtic supporters faithful through and through over and over we will follow youuu
well that's it for celtic for another season , we just didn't add the quality to the squad , yet again more poor defending .
celtic were lucky to get nil .
last year it was celtic , this year ajax . we can't win them all boys . ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíô
if it wasn't for celtic getting howked today would probably be in my top 5 worst tuesdays .
aye what ! ref cheated ! and so did ac milan !!
balotelli amazing , kaka playing like kaka of old , celtic shite !
can't believe celtic lost 3-0 . that bus home from the match will be a quiet one .
celtic crash out
geez barca and celtic lost :(
celticüëçüëçüëç

full time : basel 1-0 chelsea | celtic 0-3 milan | porto 1-1 austria wien | steaua 0-0 schalke | 
pish poor !!!! 
celtic with the bobby sands banner in the ground üôà
it's a good night when barcelona and celtic both lose ! 
even a win vs barcelona at the nou camp won't keep celtic in the cl . it won't even get them into the europa league either ! 
 0-3 e 2-1 . classifica gruppo h : barcellona 10 punti , milan 8 , ajax 7 , celtic 3 .
in all these years , have never been so close behind √ßa in the cl group stages . and this is our worst season yet . that's irony !
told you i wasn't a football expert . celtic really deserved something though , they were dominant but couldn't defend corners !
my euro acca , had milan , chelsea and barca to win . ffs !!!
the only consolation to having celtic in the cl is that they've won me money every week they play :)
ft : celtic 0-3 milan . milan through to the next round . 
bocanstricter isn't a celtic player !

fulltime : celtic 0-3 milan kak√° , zapata & balotelli give milan a deserved 3-0 victory over celtic at celtic park . 
ft : celtic 0 - 3 ac milan ( kaka 13 ', zapata 49 ', balotelli 60 ' ) #3point
i'm genuinely surprised that god awful milan side have just pumped celtic at parkhead .
celtic fans will be drowning themselves in super tennants tonight and avoiding work tomorrow . as usual . 
milan must win ajax to qualify
get it up you celtic !
awh goodnight celtic
‚ô•a.c milan‚ô• 3-0 ^_^ ( feeling great ! )

full time celtic 0-3 ac milan ( kaka ', zapata , balotelli ) 
couldn't give less of a fuck about celtic's banner tonight . wallace and sands are both as dead as their champions league campaign .
at least the celtic 5 a side team are still in europe !!!
off course my dad would rip that celtic lost üëç
ft . celtic - milan 0-3 . 
celtic beat of off ac milan whereas chelsea got beat off basel . basel ! hahaha
celtic park is one of the toughest grounds to go to on a cl night . really didn't expect an out of sorts milan team to go and win 3-0 there .
piss poor celtic
well played milan still a very classy outfit , shocking marking at set pieces though 
well done ajax ... milan fans are probably not happy with this result ...
celtic fans applauding kaka as he comes off . classy ... very classy indeed . :d

26/11/2013 milan won !
ajax beat barcelona 2-1 and celtic have been knocked out of europe
that's as bad as it could have went ! spanked 3-0 off a poor milan side and ajax beat barca to knock celtic out of europe completely !

winning 3-0 in celtic park , no problem . genoa at home , oh fuck shit

almost everything went as i predicted except for celtic and napoli . nice matches however 
buzzing for san siro . milan - ajax !
ft : celtic 0-3 ac milan ‚Äì neil lennon's side are out after losing at home to the italians .
celtic fans clapping and singing do not understand football , if you're 0-3 down at home you should be booing saying its not good enough .

celtic are pish , ajax just bet barca but that won't be as public as when celtic did , biased cunts .
not good enough from celtic . spent 8.5 mill on pukki , derk and balde .... haven't spent wisely . not replaced like with like from last season
if that boy zapata that plays for milan's parents had any sense of humour they'd have called him viva .
great win ac milan and ajax
what did tonight reminds me of what celtic did last year ‚öΩ 
well played basel & milan
kaka , zapata and balotelli score for milan , who will qualify for last 16 with point at home to ajax next month .

forever celtic !! 
congrats too ajax ! deathmatch agains milan !!
mulgrew with an milan shirt , personally would ban players from swapping shirts after team performances like that
upset that milan won but happy napoli lost . 
milan against ajax winner qualifies in the san siro be some game that you know
yay , i get to gloat about milan being the only team that won . non of the other teams that my friends support won .
milan's best performance by a long shot this season . surprinsingly coped well defensivly for most part . urby excellent at lb
3-0 in glasgow . that is the milan i know
need a centre back and a quality striker to compete at champs league level . the money's there so spend it celtic
celtic board got what they deserved tonight . what they don‚Äôt deserve is fans like celtics .
cl poule ajax barca 10 p ac milan 8 p ajax 7 p celtic 3 p
if it wasn't for celtic scottish football really would be a disaster !
and celtic as a matter of urgency should buy some of our u-17 they are better than that ' long ' samaras
unlucky celtic
when getting beat off ac milan is a shock , then you know you support a big team !!
3-0 home defeat to the worst ac milan side in five years , mr lawwell needs to drag his cash loaded ass to the bank & fund the manager .
celtic out of europe altogether following ajax's win over barcelona . very poor stuff from celtic tonight , set piece defending in particular .
put a bet on kaka to score first and milan to win 3-0 at 45/1 lol wish i put more than a pound on it but ow well still :)
props to milan for actually getting a convincing win .
glad celtic lost can't stand them well in milan 3-0 
ac milan will qualify out of the group now . can't see ajax beating them in italy next time out 
celtic have had it
celtic , we are ac milan . not dundee united .
i'm not giving up until it's mathematically impossible . 
paranoidise didn't look like much of a fortress tonight , an average milan team strolled it 
mon the milan
milan with the big win
love it when people slag celtic for getting beat in europe sorry forgot you could do better
celtic might aswell send amido balde and a herd of goats to the fucking nou camp
well that's celtic's europe campaign over
we go through to the knockouts on a loss and celtic are out of europe . 
barcelona lose their first game this season , really bad timing for milan .
still love celtic win lose or drew

tonight's result and our european campaign is summed up by not replacing 2 of our top 3 players who left in the summer . that is all . 
at least ac milan won ‚ù§Ô∏èüôå
aw naw celtic ! does that mean the other treble is off now ? lol hahaha 
ht celtic vs ac milan 0-3 ! ! ‚ô•

would be a shame of ajax loses with milan . they're a bunch of shits
milan wins , barca loses ? haha , perfect much ? and ajax's babies ? oh they played a fantastico match .

this celtic team couldn't score in a barrel of fannies .
disgusted that celtic are out of europe . terrible performance tonight !

' classy touch by the celtic supporters as they roundly applaud the wonderful kaka , great to see such a terrific player back to his best '
embarrassing performance from celtic and if any of you deny it you can bite ma shite and go take up tennis ya clowns
feckin feck celtic ! pish defending !!!
people moan about people laughing at celtic , but are use winning every game you play ?

full time bvb 3-1 nap ajx 2-1 fcb bas 1-0 chl cel 0-3 acm ars 2-0 om por 1-1 aust stu 0-0 shk 
good game milan !
hooper : sold wanyama : sold wilson : sold peter lawell : loaded neil lennon : yes man celtic : shite .
great game ajax . hope they get second over milan/celtic . biggest question now is who qualifies from group f ... arsenal/dortmund/napoli
in milan we trust 
it's over are out of europe after a 0-3 loss at celtic park against milan . see ya next year , always a pleasure with this great club
forest , samaras , commons , ambrose mulgrew never tried a fucking leg they should be ashamed milan were very poor
chelsea looses , barcelona looses , borussia dortmund wins , milan wins . in other words a great 
just as well ac milan are struggling at the moment .
what does celtic and a 3 point plug have in common ? they're both useless in europe .
dam ac milan win 3-0 to celtic ! and away !
actually ac milan was a little bit lucky today . celtic should have scored at least one goal
oh what a shame celtic crash out of europe after 3-0 defeat to ac milan
celtic out of clüòí
milan get the job done on the road 
real celtic fans don't let there heads drop ... 
i'd love to see rangers try and beat milan .
‚ù§ac milan‚ù§
milan a gagne 3-0 easy Óê†Óê†
so basically celtic need 7 points at barcelona to go through . it's a tough ask but i'm fairly confident . üòÇüòÇüòÇ
i will be mad if ajax lose against milan
full-time : fc 2 - 0 marseille , basel 1 - 0 fc , 0 - 3 ac milan , ajax 2 - 1 barcelona
difficult summer made that an even tougher group . had chances tonight but can't defend like that . must get back next year 
very disappointing that's us out of even the europa cup but win lose or draw celtic til i die üçÄ
just give the game away celtic it's fine well and truely beaten
back to winning track , grazie milan : *
at least celtic will still be represented in europe after christmas ! thanks to the amsterdam 5 !
finally ! finally !! we have ajax , arsenal , basel , dortmund and ac milan winning tonight of wonder 
next one : ac milan !
they could of played against milan for another 2 week and not of scored !
& then ac milan vs celtic fc
 steaua 0-0 schalke ( last day will decide the qualified ) 2-1 , celtic 0-3 ac milan ( last to determine the second )
yo he barca ! milan is next ! 
not a night to remember for celtic .... goals given away , especially the first 2 .... goalkeeper superglued to his line ... 
good game by , hard luck for 
the weird thing to see ac milan winning a game by a convincing margin this season . or any seasons under max allegri . 
¬£165 in the bank , cheers celtic 
celtic fans threatening us before the game . loooooooooooooooooool you guys have samaras on your team and you consider him a good player . lol
celtic board have to give lennon some money if they don't want season to be over before christmas every year
 win , win , win . very happy days .
chelsea , barca , marseille , naples , celtic .. 
oh lets all laugh at celtic , fucking dirty bastards . watp
ah celtic no more champions league , look forward to europa league though . oh wait ...
celtic game was a gutter but what better to come out of that and win get in there
good job .. forza milan !!!
arsenal +2 = win . dortmund +2 = win . ac milan +2 = win barcelona +2 = loss . i always get snaked by 1 fucking goal
congrats ajax , arsenal , dortmund , milan , bazil . hard luck barcelona , marseille , napoli , celtic , chelsea .
celtic game was mad tho
celtic are useless .. their cl die hards will be gutted .. all 20000 of them will turn up on saturday now
fuck off celtic
poor poor defending ! celtic first celtic last celtic overall
ft ajax 2-1 barcelona . goals from hoesen and serero mean the final slot in group h is between ajax & milan , who meet on the final matchday .
celtic sometimes you make me sad .
milan ajax is will be the deciding match . good positive result , hope it carries into serie a .
right , i'm never going to milan
and milan got a win they had to have on my bday . glad kaka and balotelli got on the score sheet again
well done to celtic
my stepdads actual stoating about going " fuck you door " " aye and fuck you tae candle " cos of the celtic score
buzzing :) 
milan v ajax game will be magic especially since they are only one point behind !
full time celtic 0-3 milan
celtic may have been defeated badly but barca lost to ajax .
 lose 3-0 to and crash out of europe , but beat 2-0 and qualify despite 1-0 defeat to .
my lil brother said last night that west brom would draw 2-2 and then just as the celtic game started he said 3-0 to milan .. 
only 1 celtic player with pass marks tonight lustig 
 all i can hear is my angry scottish dad screaming and swearing at the tv .. im guessing milan's winning ..
ac milan was simply fantastic 3 goals away to celtic ... that's just cray .
adesso barcellona-celtic milan-ajax ! facile
i thought psv would've taken care of milan , but it looks like ajax will have that chance once and for all with a score to settle .
ajax vs ac milan in de final group game will be a big game
milan need a result against ajax at the san siro to advance !
celtic stealing ynwa and grand old team from liverpool & everton 
celtic üòÇ scottish football is shit 
despise celtic so much !! think their the best team in the world , exaggerate every goal they score , they need to calm down !!!
why are the ajax fans celebrating like they just won against barca . did they just win against barca ? relax celtic its nt barca without messi
a draw or a win is what milan need to qualify .
this group was tough vs celtic , and barca is just a league of their own anyway .. but milan are crap bags
am actual sick a rangers fans who post more about celtic than they do their own teamüòÇ
that was truly embarrassing . 
good job milan . 
and of course ajax threw a wrench into the works and now milan have to host them in the last gameday . still could tumble out .
suckfest ! 
bye bye celtic , don't have to put up with those muppets during the week anymore :)
to be honest , i thought celtic would have done better .
celtic glascow - ac milan 0-3
are celtic out now ? can't see the table , surely they must be
celtic out of europe !
dortmund remains a lethal team , arsenal in great form & ac milan back at it .
celtic are shite . 
celtic are playing and i have a celtic top on rn cool
cesc gets his 3rd yellow card in the champions league this season and is suspended for the last group game , against celtic .
decision to play an attacking diamond showed plenty promise for celtic early on but the final ball never came .
the ac in milan stood for ( a)bsolute ( c)ertainties
come home to see milan won 3-0 !!!!!!!!!! this is what i love to see ! well done boys üòçüî¥‚ö´üî¥‚ö´üî¥‚ö´üî¥
today was a good day : barcelona lost against ajax ; milan won and chelsea lost againsy basel 
celtic fans conned by champions ' league myth . celtic have no chance of winning it . no excuses this year . totally out of our depth .
group h 2nd spot finale will be played between milan and ajax .
delighted with that , all to play for against milan in the next game . come on ajax !
celtic failed to replace hooper , can't replace wanyama but you can get someone strong in midfield .
well played . had to dig deep for that after recent form , but deserved the win . match v ajax will be fantastic 
hey keep calm we had a defeat last year in the same competition againts celtic ... √ßa
celtic are shite love them but dont have the quality ..!!; (
shite the night celtic ! cant even qualify for the europa league noo ! 
don't cry john collins‚Ä¶ 
cheek to be playing on the tannoy , " to play football the glasgow celtic way "! when was the last time we did that ?
other result in group h : celtic-milan 0-3 
celtic totally outclassed 0-3 by milan . but unbelievable miss from van dijk at 0-1 . credit to rossoneri for storming a fortress .
ft ! it ends 0-3 , celtic are out !
i'm not even a celtic fun , but they'll never walk alone x
when celtic win every second tweet is about the match , tonight that they were beat theres not a peep out of the lot of you's
celtic 0 - 3 milan so celtic's run in the champions league is over for this season after being comprehensively beaten by milan - hail hail !!
klasemen sementara grup h : 1 ) barca 10 pts 2 ) milan 8 pts 3 ) ajax 7 pts 4 ) celtic 3 pts
glad ajax beat barca but sad for celtic as well
what school did him on sky sports 4 no go to ? .. it looks like celtic could be out of europe altogether ... erm one game , 4 points behind .
ft celtic 0-3 milan . goals from kaka , zapata and balotelli means celtic's hopes of reaching the knockout stages are dashed ."
 ‚Äì result : celtic 0-3 ac milan . celtic go out of the champions league
celtic are out after losing 3-0 to milan . kaka outstanding . ajax win 2-1 over barca , so tonight's winners face off next week for second 
chelsea through , celtic out ... 
 ‚Äì result : celtic 0-3 ac milan . celtic go out of the champions league
well all my tweets saying " celtic for the win " and i still have faith have been completely jinxed !
celtic are such an inadequate team at this level . but because their fans can sing we should all cheer for them . do me a favor .
some of the opinions of people i follow on here are laughable whenever celtic lose , in my opinion 
and no yc/rc to milan 8 ))))
 confirmed out of all european competition for this season . disappointing for scottish football .
nd barcelonia gts humiliated .. chelsea disgraced , dortmund thumps napoli . arsenal fires past o . m .. ac milan triumphs rt . wt away 2 go
good results tonight , if im beimg honest quite gutted celtic got beat
most said it's the group of death more like group of shit . milan&ajax poor and were worse . missed opportunity big time but have to be honest
bye-bye celtic 
that home game against ajax will surely be decisive . 
celtic still in europe after christmas ... the five in the dutch jail
that just proved that right now we are a mediocre team . who happen to be champions of a nothing league ! 
milan have went so downhill the past couple of seasons
ac milan won by 3-0 over celtic 
rangers fans are laughing at celtic for losing to ac milan , but only last season when we were beating barcelona , they were playing elgin ..
ft : celtic 3 -0 acmillan celtic wave good bye to uefa !!
most frustrating thing about that was milan didn't have to break sweat for either of their goals . piss poor celtic 
i fucking hate supporting celtic sometimes
would be sporty if ajax beat milan
quality 3-0 away win against celtic
celtic 0 v 3 lawwell
celtic in the cl 13/14 : part 1 : can't score . part 2 : can't defend . conclusion : shite .
and with that 3-0 defeat to ac milan and the ajax win v barca - celtic are out of europe .
classifica gruppo h : barcellona 10 milan 8 ajax 7 celtic 3
i now regret my earlier confidence in celtic . defence was terrible and so were the attempts at goal .
well done celtic 
the european fortress of celtic park is starting to look like a deflating bouncy castle now .
ac milan were the bet of the night at 11/8 
bernadette and young declan had best be on their guard tonight ..... 
just waiting for december , 11th . fcb should defeat celtic perfectly at nou camp~
celtic gone , chelsea though im basel ...... wow 
great game by milan , probably their best of the seasn ... and we finally won a game !
milan must win or tie vs ajax in the final match of the group stage . if we lose , barca and ajax will go through .
milan beat celtic 
no european football at all for after xmas , get fucked over as well as ..... such a sweet sweet night
celtic , you're fucked !
and where is that celtic's fan that was tweeting shit to me ?..
we didn't conceded a header , we didn't conceded from a set-piece and we actually scored from a set piece ! did his homework . 
thanks milan :)
no one to score our chances . every celtic fan knew that when the transfer window shut . well done to milan .
congratz to ajax that was really a well deserved win .... try and win ac milan cuz i really want them to qualify for the next stage . 
what celtic need to learn from this years dismal results ...... we need tony watt back and someone to replace hooper !
celtic got 3more points than i thought they would .
chin up celtic , theres always next season . that will be the last chance though , cos we'll be back the year after üòèüòèüòè
haha beats 2-1 wins 2-0 won 3-0 3-1 definitely a good day ! 
don't have to worry about anymore of my annoying celtic tweets until next season now !
remember lennon said " i can win the cl with celtic " yeah and i can make toast with a hoover
shock result by ajax knocks celtic out of europe all together . hardly exhilarating now for scottish football and we are still in november !
milan wins , allegri stays . 
celtic beat me out of my bet the wankers !!!!! :'(
least celtic got beat by ac milan !
well done milan ! 
in the end milan had a decent striker
girone h : barcellona 10 milan 8 ajax 7 celtic 3
cheery bye celticüëç
kaka , zapata , balo ! its 0-3 ! hope this is turning point of milan this season ! ( with wahyu )
someone's gettin a batterin in the tunnel . tonight lol 
oh well , celtic , you did well to qualify . you were just up against some excellent teams ... better luck next time ...
lennon is out of his depth . come on celtic show some commitment to moving us forward as a club .
go milan , go ! the end . 
ft celtic vs ac milan 0-3 , emank jagoan ucl milan ne , forza ragazi !!!
barca , napoli and chelsea losing while milan is winning ! what a round in 
celtic fans only show up for big games , we do it for brechin . 
5 games played , 2 goals scored , deflection and a penalty . out of europe . worst milan team in history . glorifying terrorists . enough said .
thank god ac milan played good today 
full-time : celtic 0-3 ac milan 
very happy that celtic got pumped and have been firmly laughed out of the ' champions league party ' ahaha by the 13th best team in italy ...
at least this game was not important , not like milan last season when they decided to forget how to play
poor celtic out of europe 
celtic , haw haw
wonder if the twat shining the laser pen at the milan keeper lives near glasgow airport can't be many folk still playing with these !!!
have to applaud the fans , , board need to realise that to compete at that level , money is needed
a reckon celtic should be allowed into the ramsden cup since there simply not good enough . great effert thou ... 
this makes my day , my week , my month and my year . very important win , milan is next . i love you ajax . 
what a massive result for milan but , lifted a bit of pressure off them .
i blame kanye . üòÇüòÇ
milan won't win the champions league until maldini's eldest son or paolo becomes assistant manager . even the stats show that .
coupon may be fucked but at least the part time celtic fans have had a reality check 
grandad on phone ' supporting celtic is enough to give any fucker depression .'
disappointing night , with the departures during the summer we are weaker this season . i think last year we would have seen of milan and ajax
seen many posts on celtic . no celtic fans in europe except five in amsterdam is the pick of the bunch so far .
mixed night , my chelsea got beat but on the plus side celtic not only got beat but are out of europe all together !!!!
ucl : chelsea , barcelona , celtic , marseille , ssc napoli . how market ? laughs !
so twitter tonight , barton was at arsenal game , celtic lost , griffiths showed respect to brian , an ajax fan fell . missed anything ?
hoping we beat celtic and ajax beats milan .
what can celtic learn from tonight ? let me answer that one : scottish football is the laughing stock of europe . 
15 min to go in celtic/ac game and seats began emptying , not what ud expect from ' the best fans in the world ' 
final : celtic 0 - 3 ac milan . 
great result for ac milan .... hope they go through but wouldnt mind ajax . 
undone know what you are saying i have always supported ac milan 
groupe h : 1 . fc barcelone ( 10 pts) , 2 . ac milan ( 8 pts) , 3 . ajax ( 7 pts) , 4 . celtic glasgow ( 3 pts) . 7/7
what's wrong with chelsea , milan is back , lol barca 
in late released the head of the water by making a good performance and winner 0/3 
celtic out of europe ! least they can focus on there treble hunt ! oh wait ......
bad night for chelsea and celtic
kaka you legend !! thank you milan for this game ! 
we will play our b team against celtic game doesn't even matter so was this one but poor performance by barca
milan vs jcm tanite .. squad finna turnup
milan 3-0 celtic
that's a good day for milan 
my dad " ach that's it , lennon's had his time , time to go ". are all celtic fans this erratic ?
my prediction for the celtic game was a tad wrong lol
liverpool , man utd , chelsea , celtic , newcastle , spurs all failed to register a win there but not the famous hmfc !
completely underwhelmed . totally disappointed . utterly pished . celtic , we got what we had coming to us .
the winner of ac milan vs ajax goes through to the last 16 now that's a game to look forward to
not a real surprise that celtic got a thumping in the cl ! cant sell players for 20+ million and not replace them with any quality !
milan is next , fuck what they say !!
well milan made that look easy . ale ale ale milan ale , forza lotta vincere , non ti lascremo mai
luckily for barca , they still only need ( and will get ) one point from their final game against already-eliminated celtic to top the group .
its a rare night . milan victory , barca loss , chelsea loss . usman didn't lie against his dad too .
celtic 0-3 ac milan no hope today ... bye -bye europeüò´
it's disappointing , but we'll be back next year üçÄüçÄ
ac milan has an impressionable , great squad this year . lovin ' it üëèüíØ 
2-2 in champions league works out positive because of the crazy price on ac milan
depressing night watching celtic , even a poor milan team outplayed us
 full-time scores , some shocks : arsenal 2-0 marseille , basel 1-0 chelsea , celtic 0-3 ac milan , ajax 2-1 barcelona .
good job , , and 
perhaps zapata's best performance in a milan jersey in a long while . top all round performance from mario . montolivo's form is a worry though
 3-0 
full time : celtic 0-3 milan <33 the first time at the celtic park since 1969 with a clean-sheet ! ‚Äù
celtic are simply not good enough at that level , but can someone tell me how that milan team beat them 5-0 over those two games ?
it was delusional to think celtic could win .
terrible result celtic zonal marking a joke passing a joke and turkish ref didn't help with absolute terrible display !
fuck celtic and their moron supporters
zapata loves playing against celtic
celtic and fleetwood have disappointed me tonight , thank god arsenal won though
even though we lost am happy we qualified we're through and that celtic are out
despite chelsea losing they are thru to ko stages , as are arsenal . but celtic are out or for this season 
milan fans be like : if we lose , its because of allegri . if we win , its because of the players . 
chelsea have qualified for the next stage of the champions league despite losing 1-0 to basel but celtic are out 
chelsea have qualified for the next stage of the champions league despite losing 1-0 to basel but celtic are out 
celtic , meanwhile , can leave their passports at home - they're guaranteed to be bottom of group h
so milan and ajax play each other in the last round ! whoever wins makes it to the next round ! i'm pretty sure we don't need anymore points !
woow .... milan got their first away win of the season . 
rt if barcelona , celtic or chelsea let your bet down tonight . 
celtic have lost six of their last seven champions league games . 
ajax jst pulled a stunt .... against barca .. like celtic did
so glad ajax and milan won
unlucky celtic üò£
celtic 0 - 3 ac milan 
so celtic chelsea and barca all lost tonight
last year celtic this year ajax dat hurt
celtic out of europe all together ... that was woeful viewing , milan also a shadow of their former selves 
group of champions , & of death . 2 gemes against milan we near enough outplayed them but got mugged , barca geme we were unlucky tae ! 
ac milan and kaka are back
celtic first , celtic last , celtic over all . still proud to be a tim . 
ft : 0-3 . has to show class to upstage in their next clash in order to qualify , a draw will also do it . 
milan menang 3-0 , today is a good day 
i'm in no mood whatsoever to watch football ever again ... *checks when next celtic game is* ... or until sunday .
oh celtic .
same time same place next season . come on you bhoys in green ! 
celtic now out of europe . all post match discussions on 810mw
i remember when we beat liverpool at aviva thinkin board wil think we don't need to spend we are good enough . 
such a shite celtic team .
its official , celtic are out of europe !!! lost 0 - 3 to italian giants ac milan
celtic are practically out ... sad times for neill lennon but oh well . ajax beat barca ... awkward for eriksen .
if ajax manage to win against milan then then they'll qualify with bar√ßa who need a point to qualify .
wow , ajax with a shocking win over barca despite playing down a man . milan still have work to do on final group day despite clubbing celtic .
battered by one of the worst ac milan teams in years .
an absolute fucking disgraceful performance from celtic tonight !
celtic can also pretend to be barcelona ! mr lawell night night
unlucky celtic 
peak for celtic
unlucky celtic , still showed a bit of pride for scottish football no much of that anymore
sack the board drama queens . 
we don't deserve europe after christmas . sold best players for huge money and replace poor players on the cheap . it sums up celtic
now it all ends at san siro against ajax . if we lose , they get the second spot , if not , then milan are through
don't understand wat celtic losing tonight has got ti do with rangers lol at least i think it was ac milan they got beat off
ha ha ha celtic get it up u
celtic are out , very disappointed , not !! horrible twats !
aye well played celtic ! fucked me out of ¬£51 ya wanks !
ref was pish , but celtic were worse
celtic out of europe . crap ! 3 points from 5 games and barcelona away the last game . terrible campaign .

milan have won 3-0 in glasgow , so bar√ßa need at least a point against celtic to ensure they top the group 
no get out of jail free card 2nite for celtic ...... or the 5 in amsterdam
predictable drubbing for celtic . time we parted with all of the illusions‚Äì‚Äìand lots of the dud players too . manager not blameless either
ohh well celtic got beat haha

unhappy to see celtic out but feel they would have a decent chance of challenging for europa league
also , kudos to thulani serero for scoring against the mighty bar√ßa . ajax vs milan will be a massive game next match day 
great wins for bvb and ac milan . golden boy is always there !! :)

unlucky celtic , next timeüôè
" being a celtic supporter is not always easy , but it is always worthwhile " 
i hope to fuck the celtic board are hanging there head in shame !! lost the spine of the team last season and replaced them with reserves üëéüò°
bad result for celtic but did you get our enhanced 5/2 on an ac milan win ?
win , lose or draw i am proud to be a celtic fan . 
de boer led team puts celtic out of europe altogether . very pleasing !! 
that was really painful !! 
impressive ac milan chelsea group tightening up arsenal continue their winning ... arsenal could win the champions league ???
frustration !!!!!!!!!!!!!! f u celtic ( sometimes )
i hope this game was the season's turning point for milan
" i love you but you make me want to slit my wrists " the celtic story
for all their difficulties milan could be the only italian team going to knockouts .. hope thats not the case .
great lost 6k and celtic lost :/
well done milan
believer it or not , i've actually made some of my friends hate celtic .
great performance from arsenal and ac milan
result : ajax 2-1 barcelona . ‚óÑ hosen and serero mean the final slot in group h is between ajax & milan , who meet on the final matchday . 
yes celtic should be doing much better than they are , but rangers fans arent in a place to criticise , nor are any other scottish team !
well done ajax . well done milan .
still want to see milan goals thoughüò§
celtic have failed to score in six of their last seven champions league games . 
it's full time . basel , arsenal , dortmund , ajax & milan all won . 
oh well another year of just celtic in the champions league next year from scotland
ft celtic vs ac milan 0-3 ! ! ‚ô•
sooo many things wrong with that . players , tactics , lack of quality . a bit embarrassed ! 
full time bvb 3-1 nap ajx 2-1 fcb bas 1-0 chl cel 0-3 acm ars 2-0 om por 1-1 aust stu 0-0 shk "
celtic are the most over rated team ever
allegri can sleep comfortably tonight . can't deny that there's a lot of work to do in the 
fucking sick man . too many players didn't turn up and you can't give players like kaka a free header in your own box . 
love seeing celtic get turned over 
not gonna lie , surprised milan beat celtic that bad at home . that place is a fortress . celtic usually very tough at home .
ajax-milan game will be a must watch .
now milan have to win over ajax and hoping that celtic will be beaten by barca . oh and celtic should keep ajax from winning against them .
celtic couldny score in a fucking brothel
ranking group h ( after 5/6 games ): barcelona 10 - milan 8 - ajax 7 - celtic 3 . last games , in 2 weeks : barcelona-celtic .
ajax 2-1 barca barca not yet group leader , it stil game on between ac milan and ajax as both team won
the celtic fortress has finally fallen
ft celtic 0-3 milan the hoops ' hopes of qualifying for the uefa champions league last 16 for the second year running come to an end :-(
celtic frustrate me so much and make me so angry at times üò≥

it really sucks i could not watch the match but i am so happy ac milan won & kaka scored :) i knew this would happen :)
i just fucking love the celtic ... that is all üçÄüçÄüçÄ
milan is that team though . fuck a barcelona
my humour is celtic .
just seen the celtic score . we now officially have as much chance of winning the champions league this season as they do .
nice to actually see milan turn up for the first time in ages , but the ajax win makes things difficult
" rebecca you might want to change that celtic top before we go to glasgow airport " i have no more clothes at ur house dad
oh the celtic are shite
such wonderful club that use really are ? players like gauld , if he were at celtic he'd be worth ¬£10m due to biased news reporters !
grupo h 1 ) barcelona 10pts 2 ) ac milan 8pts 3 ) ajax 7pts 4 ) celtic 3pts
celtic defence were more exposed tonight than james forrest on a night out in prestwick !!
that was without doubt one of the worst nights in celtic park . cue a melancholic car journey back home .
i love you milan .
gutted :( ah well here we go 10 in a row üçÄüíö 
aaahhhhhh chelsea ahhhhhh fuck sake . aaahhhhhh . guessed arsenal and the celtic score bang on and chelsea fuck it all up . missed out on ¬£700 .
fuck celtic fuck everything stop texting me !!! we are out our league could not care less !
ac milan 3 - 0 celtic baloteli is the best
champions league ( group h ) standing : 1- barcelona 10 pts 2- ac milan 8 3- ajax 7 4- celtic 3 barca vs celtic at camp nou on 11 dec .
lot of showdowns on matchday 6 .. napoli vs arsenal , basel vs schalke , milan vs ajax .. only one can go thru in all scenarios
as for celtic , poor . very poor . such a drop in quality from last season .
let's be honest celtic probs did have the hardest group 
celtic defence zonal or man to man ?? wasn't either just miserable .
what does james forrest's half-inch cock and the celtic defence have in common ? both have been stretched and exposed for all to see !!
milan vs celtic 3-0 at celtic park fiorza milan ac milan pride
hope milan beat them cunts in san siro
christ what a fuck up can't even finish 3rd for parachute in to europa league . how painfully obvious it is that we need a striker !!!
now that i got my license , and car . working for a tattoo . going with the celtic cross .
whaaaaaay , no more europe for celtic !
awesome for ajax to beat barca . didn't watch the game but it sets up an interesting game between milan and ajax
barca need to win !! want celtic to qualify for europa league !!!
celtic knocked out of after suffering 3-0 loss to ac milan 
celtic have failed to score in six of their last seven champions league games . 
celtic fans forever saying " always next year " üòÇ 
ft : celtic 0-3 milan - in a scoreline that flattered the road side , still a massive win for the serie a side , as celtic wave " bye bye " to cl
hahaha celtic have been knocked out of the champions league !
no discredit to ajax ... milan in a ucl must-win game at home is basically a sure thing .
very week on celtics behalf ! going out with a whimper doesn't cover it . very disappointing 
so after milan fans hold players hostage they wanna win games
celtic then , celtic now , celtic forever !
we just need a point against celtic to ensure top spot
congratulations to celtic on another 3-0 home loss to an italian side , hope that you don't make a hobbit of it
glad to see celtic lost
anyone notice lennon almsot run up the tunnel there , not going to stay and with your players and address the fans no ? 
celtic have lost 11 of their 23 european games against italian sides ( w5 d7) . 
atleast dortmund and milan won
3-0 . finally allegri can sleep well tonight . forza milan .
i hate celtic they r crep lol
poor celtic lmao not even europa league
el milan ha guanyat 0-3 al celtic i el dortmund 3-1 al n√†pols . 
morale of the story : no matter how shit milan are it's always good enough to bet the bheasts
kaka is key to milan's success
lets all laugh at celtic
if celtic were as shite as ajax and milan we would dae awryt
what a shit ending to a great campaign lack of oomph throughout from celtic ref a dick as per but players had very few ideas
worst milan side prob ever , says alot about us , shocking defending , our team is only just good enough for the spl .
acmilan 3-0 celtic fc ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
well were woeful tonight , proves they don't deserve to get any further , gutted !! 
found out bigtime tonight . had a bad day at work due to my own shortcomings , sadly celtic were the same . 
grupo h 1 ) barcelona 10pts 2 ) ac milan 8pts 3 ) ajax 7pts 4 ) celtic 3pts
celtic are shit
abeg what did milan do right tonight ? 3-0 away to celtic is massive ! forza milano !
maybe celtic are keeping all the money for the 10 in a row and qualifying for cl is good enough . i'd settle for that . there ! i'm happy again
oh and i'm so happy for ac milan ! they deserved to win ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
 | groupe h : 1 . fc barcelone 10 pts 2 . milan ac 8 pts 3 . ajax 7 pts 4 . celtic 3 pts
see , look at that ffs . they conceded 3 goals to milan for god sake .
 what have you done ? ok , you don't like but this is not correct 
today's featured job : tool & die maker in milan . $17-20/hr . day/afternoon shift . 2-4 years of prev experience . call 734-241-2040 . please rt !
but on another note celtic got slapped lol
celtic are out , yes then
milan is next !!
bye bye celtic 
well at least we can concentrate on the league now ...........: -\ 
well a said when the draw was made that celtic would get a maximum of 5 points , doesn't even look like they're gonna get that #100barup 
celtic out of europe ! ah well it was on the cards eh !!
celtic fans will be gutted tonight but not as gutted as when ict beat them on the final day of the season to win the spfl .
ft ajax 2-1 barcelona . goals from hoesen and serero mean the final slot in group h is between ajax & milan , who meet on the final matchday .
my dad just said ' it's smashing man ' about that celtic game .... üòÇüòÇ 
there is a certain standard celtic should attain . we are now going backwards from that standard quickly .
ac milan or arbroath ?
milan an ajax ago battle it out fi go thru
celtic out of europe altogether . bye .
so much wrong at celtic it's hardly worth talking about - let's get a team on the park then think about moving forward
full time celtic vs milan 0-3 . grande .. grande !!!!
barca 10 point , milan 8 point , ajax 7 point , celtic 3 point .... 
disappointing cl campaign this season 
milan sorted . arsenal sorted .
as a neutral - sad to see out of europe tonight , pretty poor performance though .
any company would struggle if they lost their best parts and replaced them with cheap alternatives . celtic no different 
ajax still has a chance in the champions league !!! we killed barcelona , we're gonna kill milan
celtic crashed out of the uefa champions league and europe altogether after going down to a 3-0 defeat to ac milan at celtic park . 
if barcelona lose next round and milan win , we can go top of the group .
celtic are out of europe !
27 nov champions league - group h ft ajax 2 barcelona 1 ft celtic 0 ac milan 3
celtic can no longer qualify for the next stage of this year's competition after losing to milan at home 3-1 . 
lol celtic are knocked out of europe . makes me feel better
ac milan slapped celtic 3-0 !!! 
humped 3-0 by a milan team sitting 13th in the league n haven't won away from home all season üôäüôâ
 0-3 kaka helps flush the scottish side's chances of finishing in the ' number two ' spot down the toilet . enjoy the spl , bhoys
fitba sucks sometimes - but being a celtic fan at a time like this doesn't come close to sucking like it does being a zombie sevco fan(ny) !!
pretty disappointed with celtic after that performance
i really hope milan sign some top class players in the transfer windows , i hate seeing them doing as bad as they are .
 to celtic glasgow supporters losing 3-nil and still singing . 
milan need a draw against ajax at san siro to qualify .
ajax beat milan . would be ideal . we beat the celts and get basel the next round . i'll cry in joy 
next match should be a " deathmatch " between milan & ajax
3 away goals against celtic is not easy ... congratz 
bad result awful performance anyone that thinks 1 player would have changed that is a mong . but in positive news celtic got smashed 
well done milan an easy win üëè
with this result barcelona is officially go to the 1/16 final . ac milan is on the 2nd , ajax 3rd . they will face each other for last ticket .
 grup h : barcelona 10pt , milan 8pt , ajax 7pt , celtic 3pt 
worst celtic performance since the mowbray days
exit to sleep after enjoying a match milan 
 ... gtf !!!!!!!!! hate it ! poor by celtic this cl season ... and barca getting beat by a 10man ajax .. aye ok !
big shocks in europe tonight ajax beating barcelona and celtic getting humped at fortress paradise 
 finaliza en glasgow 0-3 celtic park 
it's $2 guinness pint night !! celtic music starts at 8:30 pm 
let's all laugh at celtic , let's all laugh at celtic na na na na , na na na na !!!!
poor defending from celtic for the goals . :/
ac milan actually put paid to celtic's pretentions
chelsea have qualified for the next stage of the champions league despite losing 1-0 to basel but celtic are out of ucl .
that full celtic team needs a complete revamp
what a bad game from us ! bad luck but simply too much errors . so the barca game left for 3pts but no europe after newyear . 
celtic has world class fans
champions league ( group h ) standing : 1- barcelona 10 pts 2- ac milan 8 3- ajax 7 4- celtic 3 barca vs celtic at camp nou on 11 dec .
how was celtic's 3-0 home defeat to the worst milan side in decades ?
if your club are of a decent standard . and know the rules of football and know how a club should be run .. by all means .. have a go at celtic
rt is winst op milan !!! 4you
great win for milan and ajax ! 
had milan to win by 3 or more so that lays for my next couple of weeks of bets . only staked ¬£1 but still , ¬£12 back .
not gonna talk to anyone for a while 
celtic have money , not spending it , not replacing those who have moved on cost us a hell of a lot .
despite losing , chelsea are through to the knock-out stages . celtic are out , and it comes down to the wire for arsenal ! 
great result for the gooners and milan good night
study if ajax beat milan though
thanks for the cash-monies ac milan / skybet ! 
celtic are a champions league team
lets all laugh a celtic hahahahaha ! 
this is d 3rd consecutive yr milan , barca are in same group
ac milan scored the best result in the matchs today
its so nice to see milan winning for once
celtic till i die 
barcelona 10 , milan 8 , ajax 7 , celtic 3 . barcelona-celtic , milan-ajax .
celtic were terrible tonight , out of europe again . only lustig got pass marks for me
milan looks to be the favorite imho .
work with celtic fans going to be unbareable tomorrow
so much for barca ' liking ' celtic and helping them go through , never done them much of a turn tonight
some of the photos of that milan fan who fell from the stand ... hope his family aren't on twitter .
plm milan kontre celtic
i keep saying it milan has talent but lack motivation
wondering what celtic actually do at training . it ain't defending , passing , or shooting 
bad night all round both beaten comprehensively we'll be back
great win tonight for milan , should play like this every game . 
celtic were fucking rotten the night
oh well at least the bank balance at celtic fc is doing well
grupp h nu : 1 . barcelona 10p 2 . milan 8p 3 . ajax 7p 4 . celtic 3p milan-ajax barca-celtic avslutar 
every day we r in championsleague action , regardless of the result , i rejoice . my heart soars . some clubs go out of existence . celtic go on .
girl , i can take you on a shopping spree in milan .. jk get in this venture & let's go to boulders
the economy celtic live in means that we can't spend ¬£5 million on a striker the money is just not in the scottish game to justify it !!
full time celtic 0 - 3 milan
so let me get this straight . i bet on ajax to beat celtic and they lose . cost me 90 quid . i don't bet and they beat barca ? alright then .
to think the papers have been talking about how bad milan have been all week , celtic were dreadful tonight 
never mind celtic fans .... gives you a chance to devote all your attention on your title challenge with inverness 
milan - ajax just became a deciding game ... not sure who to support yet ...
feel so bad for celtic .
celtic out the champions league always was going to happen
full-time ! champions league group h . ajax 2-1 barcelona celtic 0-3 ac milan
had a nice winner on ( champions league celtic v ac milan ) with - oh the celtic are shite !!
great result for tonight
milan won woo
it's that time of week again : thoughts are with the spouses of celtic fans up and down the country at this tough time 
at least we still lead group h two points in front of milan 
champions league results : ( group h ) celtic 0-3 ac milan and ajax 2-1 barcelona with the upset .
ranking group h ( after 5/6 games ): barcelona 10 - milan 8 - ajax 7 - celtic 3 last games , in 2 weeks : barcelona-celtic , milan-ajax
celtic where fucking awful tonight .... oh well still the best team in scotland
milan played well , now time to watch misfits .
rangers and celtic are both shite
awful night for celtic , they now even miss out on the europa league . that will hurt financially .
celtic are scottish not irish 
celtic should just go to barcelona and have a huge fucking party
ranking group h : barcelona- 10pts , milan- 8 , ajax- 7 , celtic- 3 .
celtic done well for the group they had , no other team in scotland could play any team in that group and win a game
3-1 for dortmund .. 2-0 for arsenal .. 3-0 for ac milan .. ucl ..
group h barcelona : 10pts ( gd : 6 ) ac milan : 8pts ( gd : 3 ) ajax : 7pts ( gd : -3 ) celtic : 3pts ( gd : -6 ) 5
what's to blame for celtic's exit ? tough group ? tactical errors ? bad luck ? lack of/wrong investment in transfer market ?
said last year that celtic would cope for a year in the champions league . no way they would do as well without three of their best players .
 all losers today . the gunners were the winners . 
celtic just need 8 points against barcelona to ensure they get through the group stage .
milan need a draw against ajax at san siro to qualify .
never mind celtic . back to the grindstone of the spl . roll on st. mirren and ross county . 
celtic lost 3 key players this summer . wilson was more than adequately replaced by van dijk , but wanyama and hooper are sorely missed .
hahaha ! celtic not even in europa league , beautiful . 
unfortunately for celtic kaka back to being a top , top player
if only barca has beatan ajax , not the other way around . milan would be in knock out round by now .
congrats ac milan
arsenal and milan won , barca lost . this has been a great day .
celtic hammered and a great performance by 10 man ajax . top night of european football üòÉ
the look on the celtic fans faces up here is brilliant
yeaaaah celtic-milan 0-3 in glasgow , great performance . thx for the goals : kaka , zapata and balo :) forza milan .. continuing my 
ajax and ac milan to drag it out
gutted üçÄ
enjoyed watchn the rossa p7s tonight flying , at least i didn't endure celtic getn punched :((
great win by a wonderful vibrant ajax side , really hope they qualify and beat milan . first loss for tata martino . great subs for young guns
milan v ajax in the final group game - that'll be a cracker . everything to play for ! winner thro . loser only gets europa .
champions league ( group h ) standing : 1- barcelona 10 pts 2- ac milan 8 3- ajax 7 4- celtic 3 barca vs celtic at camp nou on 11 dec .
we are celtic supporters faithful through and through , over and over we will follow youüçÄüíö 
poor celtic :(
the fans in jail in amsterdam must be delighted . they've stayed in europe longer than the celtic team üòÇüòÇüòÇ
so that's celtic 20m out of pocket already . fuck me , there will be no teams left in glasgow at this rate
ac milan are a joke this season
great to listen to all the tactical geniuses at the game !! stick to champ manager 
well played celtic players . you've now got 8-9 months before you play in a game that requires your utmost skill and dedication . 
celtic is awful ..
don't even think celtic tried tbh
milan vs ajax for a place in the knockouts . this season milan knocked out psv to advance to groups , ?
