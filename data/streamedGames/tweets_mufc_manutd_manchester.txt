 i'd rather have veron then felleni in the team . fellini is not united player .
blatant red card offence from wayne rooney . as usual , one rule for the big clubs and a different rule for everyone else 
if fans and moyes cant already see how desperate we are for class in midield then i give up 
are these commentators for real ? they think that was a red card offence ? soft as butter , 
silly booking for rooney . might be lucky to still be on the pitch .

manchester city 6-0 tottenham en la .

i believe in manchester united ... they just have to put some pressure on cardiff city thats the ket answer right now i think 
 cardiff city vs manchester united
12 - first bit of pressure dealt with by city . united head wide from the corner . 0-0 
rooney being stupid here like !!! we need him on the pitch , and especially next week when we batter spurs ! 
rooney is guaranteed to score now after that show of petulance 
felliani is so average !! lazy by moyes to just go back to his old team as his main signing in the summer , nowhere near worth 28 mil . 
cardiff city vs manchester united !! ggmu !!
cardiff city vs manchester united
all the ladies who are watching the manchester united match have an extra reason today because jimmy choo is in the stadium 
is rooney eligible for a retrospective punishment for that ? textbook example of violent conduct , but ref's seen it/booked him ... 
come on manchester united !
manchester united come on . 
manchester city is destroying tottenham right now
disgusting from ... thought he has matured

ow tottenham fairies got it good an proper i ain't a manchester supporter city or united but there 😬🐼
manchester city have now scored more goals at home in the league this season than any other premier league side have done in total .
if an player had tried that rooney kick out it's fair to say he would have missed 
glory glory manchester united !! ♥
serious weekend in doncaster with the fam . now back to manchester :)
the good thing : manutd is playing in the away kit which i finally bought it since 2 weeks ago , the bad one : i haven't celebrate that yet -_-
if had kicked out like just did , how long would his ban have been . 
just landed in this b ! tch -- in a rush to catch the game .
first 13 mins and rooney should have been sent off and smalling is so not a right back can't pass a ball ! 
when my dad tries to convince me to become a manchester city supporter by telling me how good looking the players are .
rooney should have been off ! no need for that ! 
wow ! the ref just bottled a big decision there . rooney should have gone , what on earth was he thinking ?! 
so many perfect people from sheffield/leeds/manchester sighhh
rooney should have been sent off . scoreline is now irrelevant . 
good work from . 
as an aside from that fascinating topic though , rooney should have been off 
it needs nani .. 
5 cantonas ..... united united united christmas is around the corner 
glory glory manchester united !!!!
manchester city produced a ruthless performance to hammer tottenham hotspur 6-0 and maintain their 100 per cent record at the etihad ...
samir nasri was happy to see manchester city maintain their unblemished home record in the premier league after a 6-0 thrashing of to ...
manchester is red . blue is film
makes you laugh that wes brown gets sent off for a good tackle but rooney gets a yellow for kicking out haha 
big fan of martin tyler's use of the word ' abject ' there .. he's always been a wordsmith . 
rooney is really lucky to still be on the pitch , that was bad that 
manchester city wins 6-0 now all i need is the jets to come through !! 
come on lads don't let me down today 
gawd damn !! wtf ws that , u ass ?!!!! 
fucking hate manchester united .
9 ' rooney should've been sent off , the jammy git only got yellow . still cardiff city 0-0 manchester united 
lol manchester at the back womp
both the match and the 1 sound crap so far :-( i knew the race would be dull though . come on united . 
manchester is so pretty and christmas
i ain't no mufc manager so i can say this ... fellaine ain't a utd type of player . 
for someone who is the lynchpin of the team , that was stupid 
go manchester united ..
that's a sendoff 100 times out of 100 . chickenshit refereeing . 
no rvp in the united side today , he's probably counting his money somewhere . 
 in red kinda intimidating v in blue 
rooney was very lucky not to see red there 
so come on david moyes , play like fergie's boys ! we'll go wild , wild , wild ! we'll go wild , wild , wild ! fergie lives on ! 
we win today , go 4th , sit back and watch the other ' contenders ' start shittin in their pants 
manchester need to play with that hunger and pressure they did against arsenal all the time to be successful
kick off come on united 
a rather confused looking wilfried zaha has been seen wandering around the press box at cardiff . 
smalling just gives the ball away for fun ! i swear he still can't believe he plays for hense why he always passes to the opposition !
 may god see us through
b . leverkusen sidney sam will miss wednesday clash against mufc due to thigh injury .
should have been a red card for rooney , dirty ! 
tom cleverley nowhere as usual !

wow manchester city y u no stop scoring
we're still yet to see fellaini winning headers n breaking up play in the middle of the park . this dude just looks clumsy .. 
we all know wayne rooney will be rinsed for that for at least an entire month ! simply because he's a manchester united player .
wayne rooney is still suffering from international break hang over 
manchester was incredible !!!
 should have gone then . another let off for . if the ref gave a yellow , he saw it and it's red .

i think that 100% of non manchester united fans would agree when there is a big decision to be made against utd the ref bottles it everytime
rooney is a lucky lad .... should have been sent off but the ref let common sense prevail & it paid off . 0 - 1 
" he should have gone " they say , well he didn't , he's still on the pitch and he's punished you 
i'm manchester united fans since primary sch :d
dais what we talking bout rooney !!: d 
if that was rafa on the overlap , tonio would have passed it . smalling ... not so much .

3-0 to us let's hope . 🙏🙏 
rags getting all the big decisions again 
manchester united all the way ! 😄🙋 
once again , depending on referees ! rooney should have been sent off ! 
we led courtesy of rooney bt i still think should have given a chance .

yay so rooney scores !! keep the reds flag flying high !!

it's a good job that volley from cleverly was blocked as it masked what would have been the worst volley in history . 
considering its a 5-5-1 against a 4-4-2 , rooney took on a lot of men . 
great to see that finally extended the contracts of referees .

cardiff vs manchester united ....!!! 
hernandez should be out , there's is better players than him ! he is doing nothing . 
rooney scores after somehow not being sent off for booting a player . 
 without the injured today find themselves 1-0 up through at 
 a real prospect for us . very confident . nice player indeed . 
manutd is a fckn team nd a half ( team . 5 ) 
fellaini getting stuck in there 
come on david moyes play like fergie boys bergemuruh di cardiff city stadium . 
where was the foul by fellaini ? 
good goal rooney 10 
that's how i got my interview at manchester hospital

the atmosphere at cardiff is amazing . 
yess !! 
rooooooney !! 🙌 
 i'll be with you in spirit today ! 
januzaj only 18 and in the squad for just 3 months , yet he looks like he's been in the squad for 3 years ! 
evra seems like such a cunt 
any other team = sending off . man utd ? yellow card . surprised the ref didn't book the cardiff player instead . typical . 
glory glory manchester united !!!!
fuck the ref 
how was that even a foul ?? 
breakfast . internet . my first manchester united vs secondary team cardiff city playing . formula one during the commercials . busy morning .

glory glory manchester united
ref please give fellaini d red card that wud send him out of our team 
fellaini gets done a lot for things solely because of his height and how clumsy it looks ... just like zigic 
oliech " my dream is to play in europe . i admire teams like liverpool , manchester united & real madrid ," that was in nov 2003
rule 59 . don't give a red card to a manchester united player cause he's a red devil or ( what ?. ) .
watching both now . 
seriously felliani is 2nd best for every single challenge he does 
someone tell birtles to shut up about rooney 
bloody hell . third foul from fellaini . 
not an impressive start 
22 ' cardiff city 0-1 manchester united
you have to feel for cardiff . rooney should not be on the pitch . i'll take the goal though .

wayne rooney ! 
roonay \☺/ i'm happy for manutd and my fantasy league team .
rooney !!!! bitchez !!!!!!! 
sport can be cruel as rooney could easily have gotten a red card and then he goes on to score 
these analyst need to shut up about rooney already it wasn't that bad . 
wayne rooney has now scored 205 goals for manchester united . 
this ref either hates fellaini's hair or doesn't have is contacts on . fucking dumbo ! 
over/under on # of times announcers are going to say rooney should be off the pitch : 732 . we get it . you can shut up now . 
some one in manchester come and see hunger games with me :) ??

ref is such a bitch 
20mins into this game , im already sleepy . i cannot finish a game w/o falling asleep
dear manchester united fans , started from the bottom , on our way to the top . 
watch my team play now 
come on ref that wasn't even a foul ... 
the difference between being a manchester united player & an ex-manchester united player : wes brown yesterday & wayne rooney today .
that ref obviously needs glasses ... twat .. 
manchester united
pretty sure fellaini just said to the ref " i'm tall ! i'm just tall !"

rooooooooney👌😁 
 cardiff vs . manchester united :) 
just seen someone put " rooney shouldn't be on the pitch and i'm a united fan " surprisingly he's not from manchester , or england
januzaj has been very quiet so far 
just got he's tall , doesn't mean every challenge by fellaini is a foul ! 
glory glory manchester united !
can't wait until darren fletcher comes back for so he can put tom cleverley back in his place ! 
januzaj is going to be special . 
manchester city never makes me sad . haha 6-0
i love manchester united , they have good players , maybe they might even be winning the cup this year , hmmm :/ :)
januzaj really does have a fantastic delivery . he's far better than dhl . 
javier hernandez is that guy 
united day ! 
my brain is having a tough time processing that mufc is in blue , playing a team in red . hard to teach an old dog new tricks
wayne rooney score !! wazza ! manutd 1-0 cardiff
fellaini is shit , how he cost that much is beyond me 
 manchester united vs cardiff city

our blood is red and so is manchester united :d 
mu is going good . 
evra is really a calming influence on the team . 
lol , this ref supports the same team as me ... united 
manchester is full of shit !!!!!!!!!!
keep reading that marouane fellaini isn't a ' manchester united midfielder '. well , he's average and cost a fortune , seems about right to me .
fellaini getting picked on a bit . each of his three fouls was slightly harsh . 
come on man u 
 . the ref has inadvertently ruined this game by not administering justice . retrospective ban must at least take place . 
manchester united will win tonight !!!!!
went to the christmas/german markets in town with beth and talia and they were such a letdown , manchester is so shit and boring
good to see adnan in the starting xi . he is a great player and needs some matches to show his skills . 
rooney sent off or having to listen to sky bang on about it for the next week . not sure which i would prefer to be honest ? 
shut up moaning , yellow card at most 
watching utd with spanish commentators not a clue what they are saying but still more entertaining than english shite 
proper good day , love my manchester family
expect many januzaj assists and chicha , rooney goals 
23 - city searching for the leveller . campbell takes down a cowie cross , before odemwingie fires over . 0-1 
 !!
hate everything about manchester united
 message to all refs . ferguson won't shout at you if you send one of their players off . rooney should have gone kicked out .
com'on man u ! lets wip cardiff's ass ! 
adnan januzaj is the diego fagundez of manchester united
we will fight , fight , fight for uniiiiited till we win the football league !!! 
januzaj needs to stop losing possession in the half
not a bad game this . very open and end to end . anything can happen today . 
idc who will win this . at the end of the day i want to see the falling of arsenal . and the fight between manchester clubs with chelsea .
this referee is one of the worst in the epl 
evans has grown since moyes ' arrival . 
just because he's tall , doesn't mean every challenge by fellaini is a foul ! 
are we all ready for a classic referee " evening up " decision to make up for not sending rooney off ? 
manchester united game and homework
why is it that hotspurs fc are ashamed of releasing updates of their match with manchester city , i've been waiting for like ... lol
na diz kin game manutd no dey win
settle down lads 
so far this season i've noticed is really good at committing fouls . 
goal- cardiff 0-1 manchester united - wayne rooney ( 15 mins )
fuuuuuucked .. manchester has done me and my bank balance over
 question : so what exactly is tom cleverley ? answer : he is the 2013 darron gibson
when cleverly doesn't do anything cleverly . 
walking round manchester smelling like a guy after smelling a million different aftershaves😂
rio almost fucked it . 
trop gourmand januzaj 
 where are you ? 
wayne rooney should of get sent off but he's the one who gives manchester utd the lead typical referees .....
game stops every time big fella touches the ball . 
this is going to be a difficult game today , particularly because of the passionate home crowd have got . 
come on you reds !!! 
doing my english paper and watching manchester united vs . cardiff on tv loving it 
we be lucky to finish with ten men here ! mufc
in 3 hours i'll be back in manchester 
this could well be one of those games where the ref is gonna look to even things up by giving a soft penalty 
bloody hell ! rooney is always full of surprises . 
cardiff city fans urging mufc fans to support their local team . cardiff av home att in ' 13/14 ? 27,445 . in ' 06/07 ? 11,720 .
1 goal isn't safe 
no carrick still no kagawa , sucks . don't want to see kagawa leaves ... 
you can never play down manchester united ... as much as i hate them .
januzaj's working rate is high 
manchester is red ( not ) blue !
rooney , who should have been sent off , scores with a deflected shot ... looks like same old man utd is back ! 
this ref makes being big look like something bad frivolous calls on fellaini 
good manchester united 1-0 cardif
manchester is full of shit
cardiff city 0 : 1 manchester united > =) | rooney
i love manchester united
playing without vital keys ! 
cardiff city 0 -manchester united 1 yeayyyy

i love wazza 
januzaj is a flash in the pan .

aaaaaaaaannd back to football !! 
love how every other club hates manchester united because they always get the " ref " on there side . 
my prediction was 3-0 cardiff an it's lookin like tht kinda scoreline atm
man utd have completed 44 interceptions in their opponents half this season , no team in the premier league have completed more . 
i've just ordered a domino's pizza from the manchester - fallowfield store .
1-0 up thanks to then giving us a goal , but why can't we pass ?? 
manchester christmas markets have killed me off

i'm starting to think these ref's are picking on fellaini ...

i spent this morning watching manchester united and dropping my phone in a bowl of lucky charms . guess they aren't so lucky .
two mins in manchester already .... steups
you can see the immaturity from januzaj 
waking up to a crushing result for manchester city against tottenham . best feeling ever . #6purs
nice game manchester city !
united need to score another before half time , its an away game ! it'll be tricky 
fellaini shouldn't be in manchester united squad .. such a waste .. hrap rambut ja kenyal .. haha
how about i need realtime reports !
evidently the physical reaction to needing to send off a player inside ten minutes is for your balls to shrivel and disappear .
can't see what fellaini ( is that spelt right ) brings to the manchester united team .
23 - city searching for the leveller . campbell takes down a cowie cross , before odemwingie fires over . 0-1 
haters gonna hate but united army gonna keep reds flag flying high 
wayne rooney our saviour , our golden boy .. manchester united 1 - 0 cardiff city
it really is unbelievable that so many cunts can play in the same team 
manchester is red , always has been , always will be .
gooooooll glory glory manchester united ! ♥
fellaini is passing and generally playing stupidly . his passes will likely put us more in danger as well . what a player . 
getting that fecking " wig " off the pitch ... 
pizza and manchester united for breakfast ! 
we don win this match fa 
dont dribble out there adnan ! criminal 
manchester united
come on reds 
if the ref has been as atrocious the whole time as he has the past 5 mins ...... 
glory glory manchester united , c'mon i believe you can !
c'mon united ... we shall never die ... 
januzaj needs to relax a bit with the dribbling in our own half !! 
23 ' total attempts 2 5
cardiff city 0-1 manchester united
this is why i don't watch mufc matches . they play with a handicap . be it wenger or ridiculous refs .
no rvp , no vidic , no jones , no carrick tonight ! but united still united !!!! 
 are lucky but cardiff are playing tough physical football was lucky not to be sentoff and is rockin
thankfully the cricket match is mute over . now going back and forth between 1 and match .
do the best manchester united . we will support you more and more .
yesterday mirallas and gerrard did worse than rooney however rooney will get all the headlines 
manchester united is my life :-)
 we don't buy world class players , we buy the officials . 😀
if manchester united have to win a nice januzaj dive wouldn't go amiss .
1-0 up ! come on !
kojelea manchester united ... * unzips
manchester united
watching and car
manchester united have been in control , however , they shouldn't be winning as rooney shouldn't be on the pitch .
good luck manchester united❤️
wazza 
the stoppage in manchester should have been saved for the football rather than the boxing .
manchester united vs cardiff city . they look good now's a good chance for them to make a run .
rooney should have been off . no question . 
we need to win this 
 thats it i would never watch manchester united play ..... unless they play manchester city . city can thrash them anytime !!!
 crossing the ball better today
savour every moment of evra this season . i have a feeling it might be his last for us with psg and monaco hovering 
 wow almost anothe goal as fellaini meets adnan janzaj's freekick with a header . we are really starting to up the pressure
sir alex ferguson with cardiff owner 
mufc haters should please hate well .. it's a very great motivation for them boiz .

24 ' cardiff city 0 - 1 manchester united
to be fair , 's tackle was nothing like wes brown's(who got sent off ) so it's obviously not a red !! 
nice game manchester city !
i want to laugh on the face of every fan booing ... just to annoy them more for life !
goal ! cardiff city 0:1 manchester united w . rooney scores assisted by j . hernandez at 15 minutes .

hahaha mr ref is wearing manutd undies i'm sure
manchester united
shit why does this hv to happen at this time while i'm watching manchester united another power outage , so not fair 
twitter full of fans insisting rooney's assault wasn't red card worthy . rest of the reasonable football supporting world disagrees .
manchester city win big score against tottenham hotspur ...... i can't believe this decision ...... mc .. 6-th .. 0
rooney's way past it now , needs to make way for the better players like carroll 
evans having a go at januzaj , looks like roy keane's had an immediate effect 
niggers wearing red wanting to play like thugs 
3 times now cleverly just kicked the ball .... aimlessly .... bit of class required 
glory of manchester united
glory manchester united !!!!!
wake up boys !! 
moyes style . hard physically body contact . 
west indies win ... time to tune into this united game ! 0-1 . wazza .

janujaz great long passes . fellani block , carrick assist and rooney's finish all needed for some more great finish 
manchester united 1-0 cardiff city , i knew they would lead , thats just the way its supposed to be ;) but its a good effort from cardiff
antonio valencia best soccer playing in united kingdoms he so tall and good with ball :) how many other players r as good lookings ? 
dont sleep on wayne please 
we goin 4th !! 
my heart stops for a second whenever evra tries an acrobatic . 
that must be quite a mouthful from evans to adnan gee needed evra to stop him 
sorely missing carrick 
worse thing has happened .. cardiff have a excuse if they lose " rooney shouldn't be on pitch " but ignore the mistake from defender . 
thanks to manchester city
janujaz needs to put some muscle on , then he'll be unstoppable . just not got the mass yet 
very sloppy game so far by both sides 
what boo huh ? 
 check the score its 0-1 united
rooney you lucky lucky boi

well there goes any sort of respect i had for a manchester united player . congrats wayne . you are now full douche .
joey barton talking sense for once 
 defense is strong

januzaj is over rated ! 
if win today then has had a good solid start as manager

martin tyler is such an anti-united cunt 
i see rooney is trying to outdo mirallas for the ' should have been a straight red ' award this weekend .

always amazes me the fat bastards in the crowd screaming " you fat bastard " at rooney . do they not see the irony . 
nothing like a game of " bogies " in the poshest part of manchester with your dad !
 need to keep on winning in other to defend their title
menit 26 , menit favorite antara cardif vs manchester united
sorry to you can't surpass ferguson . you just have to start at the beginning again . 
i had manchester united fans telling me how utterly disgusted they were as a wrong decision prevented a defeat at wba . ironic .
cardiff city 0 - 1 manchester united
janutwat is fucking awful only seen as a good player because he plays for manchester united
cardiff fans singing " you fat bastard " at rooney . i would love to see how many of them could play for 90 mins with his work rate ! 
take control of the game manchester united . . c'mon!
the printworks in manchester is so cute :)
das hw we do ... manchester city . 
united are the team for me , come on you lads ! 
 manchester - cardiff .
wayne rooney scores 
there's nothing worse than a manchester united fan 😴
 get organized and get time on the ball !
decisions like that are going to ensure manchester united keep their title . meet the new boss , same as the old boss ... 
i heart manchester united manchester united manchester united manchester united manchester united 
the midfield is lost without carrick . 
great defending by rio right there ! 
fellaini makes a tackle - foul . fellaini heads the ball - foul . fellaini has a shot - foul . fellaini breathes - foul . 
stop giving the ball away ffs 
about to stand in manchester in just shorts and a top ... the things you do not to faint at concerts
congratulations manchester city .
he's a starman on the left hand side , he plays for man . united and his name is januzaj~ 
united missing rvp and carrick , not the same team without those 2 . 
manchester united >>> ! 0771481216
some very miserable looking cockneys walking through manchester piccadilly station right now

cardiff city 0-1 man united cardiff showing no fear of united , especially down the right getting forward , 27mins gone 
waynee rooneyyy 
can't any diff between nigerian national team and manchester united
games like today are such a great learning curve for adnan januzaj 
what a crazy long weekend though from nottingham to manchester to birmingham !! crazy nights !!!
 cardiff vs manchester united
 must be loving this , playing so dangerously at the back , passing it very late .
smalling's passing is shocking . already half a dozen have gone astray 
we are . manchester united
chicha useless so far . 
he's big and he's black and he plays at the back ! it's chris smalling of mufc !!
so even if cardiff city has had most of the possession in our final third , they're pretty much finding a tough fortress . 
fellaini has been aggressive , i like that . 
come on united lets ave it boys 
even a dumb manutd fan knows that the race for the golden boot is between aguero and suarez
manchester united
oh manchester ,, is wonderful
rio ferdinand . 
scoring against de gea is just like cracking a hard nut 
fellani is woeful 
the sooner we sell rooney the better , nowt but trouble . rt if you're a true red who wants what's best for the club . 
3-0 my prediction 
fellaini looks fitter !! 
plenty of cardiff attacks originating from the right . something for to sort out . 
who has a link to the match ??
omg i cant believe it manchester city juz beat tottenham 6-0
so manchester city won 6-0 against tottenham
there is no way manchester united will be plaging in the champions league next year !
 cardiff city vs manchester united
manchester united <3
our defence is highly suspect !! 
manchester united with the lead ! 
we r getin into the top 4 ...... 
 have reacted well to going 1-0 down . their really pressuing us down the right and we're not comfortable at the moment .

fellaini is actually having a good game .

manchester city trounces tottenham 6-0 at the etihad stadium
this is our first meeting with cardiff in 38years ... 
can none of our players control a ball ? 
goal :) 
hearing roo was bang out of order . hoping we get a few more so his goal isn't so contentious & we win somewhat fairly 
wazza should have gotten a red and then scored later ... i'll take it ! 
manchester united : *
manchester city - tottenham hotspur 6:0 ( ft) . i have nothing to say .
gooll , , rooney 15 ' cardiff 0 -1 manchester united 
swarbrick is a spineless turd and manu have cottoned onto that ; when will manchester utd just fucking crawl off into the wilderness and die ?
this is the type of game where fellaini is a good addition . plays it simple , battles , breaks up play . good start from the big belgian 
on the way to manchester for 30stm :d
my kingdom for a clean-sheet ? naaaah . highly unlikely with the way that fellaini is currently playing . 
manchester united tho
rooney ... i knw u u will score another one ... 
i love januzaj's confidence on the ball , he somehow reminds me of a young cristiano ronaldo 7 
ryan giggs is named on the bench for man united . he hasn't scored in wales since his last date with imogen thomas . 
absorb the pressure boys ... 
the 2 faces of wazza . 
cardiff hasn't deafened manchester united since november 1960 . 
 leggo ! more goals !!!
just gonna watch the manchester united game
let's go manchester united
i have said it before and will say it one more time : hernandez is effective coming on as a sub !! 
januzaj is trying too many solo moves and leaving his wing lot empty .. after the goal getting too defensive 
hearing the crowd shout " you fat bastard " to rooney 😂 
impressive have won more points after 11 games this season than in three of their previous premier league title-winning campaigns .
manchester united vs cardiff today . come on rooney . wake up ! 
i'm really impressed by januzaj , especially when you think he's only 18 
glory glory manchester united
 bpl 13 / 14 manchester united vs cardiff :)
need to watch this game w manchester united today tho ...
 check the score its 0-1 united
keep it up . manchester city

why are there 2 sets of rules in football ? once again get away with a criminal decision that wouldn't happen anywhere else except

what is with this defence 
cant watch the match of mu :( but still support ! : >> glory glory manchester united
excited for manchester christmas market and the clothes show the next two weekends ☺️❄️
anyone in manchester up for some fun tomorrow ?
wayne rooney is underrated by alot of people , manchester united's best player 
this evra-januzaj chemistry is turning me on 
sorry about the late notice i was busy but , it's cardiff 0-1 man utd , goal by wayne rooney scored in 14min 1 
good night indonesia , good luck manchester united , good luck robin van persie . i love you so much : *♥
two more before half time would be bomb . c'mon 
ok this match is boring .. give some action boys 
foreign referees is a must . 
cardiff vs manchester united
how is it i go all the way to manchester , visit a ridiculously packed german xmas market and i bump into my next door neighbours ?! 
eggs , manchester united , and jax . piiiiinch me 😍
cardiff fans are insane ... so intimidating ... 
problem with mufc is that we score one goal and then relax
rooney gets booked for kicking a player when the ball is 10 yards away , yet brown gets red for winning the ball . same referee . 
feeling awesome watching manutd play !
to be fair to united , although loads of their fans have never even been to manchester , they've got some pretty good supporters too .
our centre midfield is so dead right now 
just got used to a life of luxury in london , and now it's back to scruffy manchester 😔
the amount of hate i have for manchester united
i miss kagawa's playing speed and carrick's power passes 
30 ': half an hr played btw cardiff & manutd ; goal from rooney inside 15 mins is waft separates the two sides . 
another blueshite trained scumbag scores when he shouldn't be on the pitch after assaulting someone 
i wonder why patrice evra receive so much criticism , great leader and an example for everyone 
this utd team lose the ball too much for a good side . they do hold an attacking threat tho . 
if manchester wins , we riot .
glory glory manchester united :)

that was sloppy 
wish i'd put the manchester double on today 
ggmu !!! go my best ! win n mek me happy ! manchester united the champions !!
early 1-0 . seems united get more and more stable overtime 
mufc 
manchester united must draw
there's no way this ref will allow 11 players to finish this game
moyes looks quite relaxed :))) 
januzaj doesn't fear . fear fears januzaj .

good display so far by manchester united . 
quiet 30 min for fellaini . which is a good thing for him . 
mufc , the frustration continues .....
manchester united 
go manchester united !!!
lets get some sharp teeth in attack 
januzai not having his best game so far 
manchester united is just trash now .
after we lost by 6 in manchester , we bought park chu young and now sit top of the league . i'm sure levy will come knocking any day now ...
we need another goal mufc
cardiff city v manchester united in the this afternoon 
hernandez and januzaj both need to be better . 
can manchester united follow that performance from foes man city ?

how does cleverley get a game ?! 
manchester united playing in their away kit of blue because hosts cardiff city , the bluebirds , of course play in red now .
jesus these cardiff fans don't half moan and whinge 
it's a slow game . 
referees have a soft spot fo wazza shlda bn out
campbell is the last player to score against in the having previously played for them in the competition .
still haven't been to the manchester christmas markets . very poor performance indeed .
manchester city 6-0 tottenham , i couldve destroyed tottenham like that by my self
tom cleverley in a manchester united shirt shocks me everytime ! useless
the only reason you hate is because we're better than you . you just haven't gone round to accepting it 😂 
 all the way .
yeah , and the march goes on , on , on !!!!
always manchester united in my heart .
he's a belgian ! a mid-field belgian ! adnan jaaanuzaaaaj~ #44

man city lost on this ground . so i would take a boring 2-0 win for over an exciting draw or loss
it is actually amazing that have won so much without every really being a dominant team in terms of possession .
up early watching the manchester united game
should united be in red and cardiff be in blue ? 
the only time i watch soccer is when manchester united play , love that team
cleverley can't hold the ball , doesn't make a forward pass , doesn't score goals . he's just a mere presence . 
i don't mind who we sign in jan as long as its a quality midfielder !!! 
why ? because he is a manutd player duhhhhhhhh
manchester city players should join masterchef because they recently made a top class tandoori chicken xd

honestly , david moyas is not the man for but again , destruction starts somewhere somehow .... could be him ...

god we're missing carrick 
its either we win or they lose 
i’m sorry , manchester city scored how many goals today !?
im sorry but i dont think cleverly is material . got to buy in jan

love that other clubs are starting to dislike adnan and boo him , reminds me of when we first got ronaldo :') 
typical goal 
don't know why manchester united bought fellaini ...
aguero has scored 10 goals whereas the spurs on a whole have scored 9 goals .. cool na ? :d 
microcontrollers and interfacing time again . i wish i could read the match updates on the tl but no , my life is a bitch . 
fellaini has definitely made his presence so far today 
by the way chicharitos pass for the goal was awesome :) x 
united are the only team in the epl along with west ham that would have less possession against cardiff lol it really is pathetic

tan's blue dragons versus mufc is a bore .
manchester united the red devils is advanced 1-0 with cardiff
i'm sure you're all watching mufc but there's more overtaking at the brazilian gp than there is on the m25 on a friday afternoon 
smalling has to be the worst passer in the  squad . looks so nervous when he gets the ball .

sherlock holmes - manchester united - one direction
evans is better going forward than clevz . sad . 
why so poor game ? tired with international matches ? 
why the hell is fellaini passing backwards all the time ? is he trying to become the belgian joe allen ? 
now : manchester united vs cardiff city 
 rooney still on the pitch after kicking cardiff player off the ball , then scores a goal . is mike riley preparing another apology ???
my brain doesn't like this match . keeps thinking the red/black team is manchester united and the blue/white team cardiff city . 
can somebody tell valencia how to play football again ? 
 there's not much difference in possesion right now but it seems tham we have the extra edge with the attack
valencia has been kinda meh . bring on zaha , moyes ! 
haven't seen that side of rooney in a long time . frustration , aggression , stupidity . should be off . 
27 mil for that .

thats why vidic is well ... vidic !! evans not world class , the squad lacks quality !! 
they would better show the replay of that cardiff goal . 
i thought would equalise and they have . they deserve it too . though i'm not happy that 2 passes took out our whole defence . 
former mufc player campbell scoress 😭😭 
lets go manutd .
how shit have mufc been though ? valencia , fellaini , everyone to be honest
we need three centre midfielders , even if we had great midfielders , i would still say the same . 
poop > manchester united
that's why jonny evans shouldn't play . not good enough for this side

what the fuck happened in manchester with the spurs ? hahahah !! i just saw the final score . six
c'mon utd !!!! start playing some football !! b 
manutd are playing the worse central midfield combination ! fellani shit ! cleverly dog shit !
odewingie with the killer pass . soft goal to concede by manutd standards . 
should've been 2-1 there . 
sometimes our defense likes to take naps in-between plays . especially evans . ferdinand is old , and can't track back anymore . 
let's get the second goal city ! be good to ruin both manchester clubs at home !
fraizer campbell likes playing against the manchester clubs , his goal has levelled this one at 1-1 
3 passes and we're undone ! why were non of our midfielders goal side of their midfielders ??? 
everyone deserves a chance !!!

because of my projects and quizzes i can't the the best matches today :( ( manchester united or uv or not al ahli vs alain ) :'(
hi manchester .
 1-1 min . 37
frazier campbell scored even though he shouldn't be on the pitch . what a joke ... 
our central defense , chai , reminds me of the nigeria vs italy game 
evans was lurking hardcore . doesn't moyes see it yet . evans and ferdi are the same . can't play two sweepers together ! 
sliced and diced by one of our own . mr campbell got a good education and this is how he repays us . 
frustrated not seeing kagawa out there today . we need a spark in the middle ! 
we are playing 10 against 11 . fellaini is useless . 
come on utd attack attack 
epl : cardiff city 1 - 1 man united . ( campbell #10 ) 
why the fuck was evans so light on the pressure ? 
tom cleverley is a professional footballer for manchester united . hahahahahahaha
this midfield is horrendous ! no creativity at all .
what good has fellaini done in this game so far ? 
c'mon lads ! need the win today ! 
ffs 😡 we need to play better , very sloppy 
our defense just isn't what it used to be ... and with someone like rio ferdinand still in there , it's no wonder . 
it astounds me how tom cleverley is rated by 2 successive mufc managers and a number of england managers . he is useless !!
i do hate cardiff but not so much today 
just sitting here , wondering when fellaini is going to do anything of note 
goal !! cardiff 1 - 1 manchester united
mufc jonny evans is so slow to get back terrible goal to give away
35 ' another chance for campbell but cannot finish this time in a difficult situation 1-1 
smh at ... they're just not the same team that they used to be .. man city wins by 6 & man u is tied to cardiff
fellaini was a big wig in a barber shop at everton ; now he's a bad perm in vidal sassoon . 
cleverly and fellaini offering 
cardiff city 1 - 1 manchester united . min 36 '
wtf 1-1 manchester united you have to win this match to be in top 6 ..
how do we expect to win when we have a bloody big hole where a central midfield should be ? 
worst buy ever in utd history , !!! we need get rid of his shit ass if we wanna get results ! 4eva 
nooooooooo mum bought me an advent calendar and i've left it in manchester .

wandering around manchester like a queen
nothing new but cleverley is just not manutd standard
we are not going to retain the epl title this season , not with moyes in charge . let's just qualify for the ucl next season 
take flamani off a waste if money 13voice 2
ohhh nooo come on 
i've decided that i want both teams to lose 
evans should've done more there . 
fraizer campbell is a product of manchester utd's youth academy , they sold him £ 3.5 m to sunderland . sunderland sold him £ 650,000 to cardiff
spurs 6-0 manchester city
cleverly looked like a demented ball boy running after the man he was supposedly marking 
and by " the pass " i mean the pass to mutch , the pass further to campbell was unstoppable . 
former manchester united player frazier campbell levels it up ... its all square in wales 1-1 
fuck off campbell eh !! wakey wakey back 4 !!
no drawing nor losing today ; we must win 
goal penyeimbang . 37 ' cardiff city 1-1 manchester united . assist : don cowie , gol : fraizer campbell

we are so average . you can see we are crying out for a central midfielder , to take control of games e.g scholes 
massively missing carrick and vidic 
i gotta admit , dat was a nice pass from osaze to campell , campell utilised it well . nice goal . stil rep 
why isn't rvp playing or even benched ? 
campbell love scoring against teams from manchester !!! 
i've seen beach donkeys trotting faster than evans . he has yet to impress me after all these years . 
campbell likes scoring against manchester sides doesn't he ;
manchester united game .
mufc <3 we can so do this
shower of fucking shite . they can stay up manchester until the realise what club they play for . that includes that cunt avb
have to give it cardiff great goal . 1-1 . 
good goal .... well done cardiff . 1-1 c'mon mufc step it up !!
just seen the goal again . can't understand why fellaini isn't the deep-lying midfielder . cleverley isn't a defensive midfielder . 
fellaini will have a tough time convincing the fans his worth
keeper joe hart will return to the manchester city team for their game against plzen on wednesday , according to manager manuel pellegrini
preparing to send invitations to church all around manchester 2014
just remembered by boss travelled up from london to manchester to see spurs get humped 6-0 . that makes me happy .
fraizer campbell is a product of manchester utd's youth academy , they sold him £ 3.5 m to sunderland . sunderland sold him £ 650,000 to cardiff
sliced through by cardiff ! great goal . we are playing too slowly , no tempo , no urgency , creativity zero !! the list can go on ..... 
think felaini should have closed mutch down quicker . scrappy united 
patience guys , we will surly take away the 3 points . 
what tom cleverly is still doing in that pitch beats me ! 
i know we can do it 
this is a class game 
" i couldn't get passed him , so i just kicked him in frustration ... but i didn't do it to hurt him ! just to say please move ." - rooney 
fellaini's been no more than a passenger in this game 
tottenham lost points so we need to win this game . come on united ! 
manchester united are playing so bad .
on current form marianne fellani reminds me of djemba djemba with hair 
i think f . campbell hates anything manchester
this is terrible 
manchester united are not teamworking ....!!!! > . < "
manchester united for life ... let's beat this niggas
if let them equalize this easy we gonna make an easy game hard to win ! 
 is a waste of space ! moyes plz take him off ! he is doing nothing ! 
haha it's great are drawing :d
what is it with these long balls . there is no movement and no ideas . turgid . 
smalling has given the ball away all game ! 
35 ' cardiff city 1-1 manchester united b sath sath
something needs to be done about the refereeing at premier league level , the amount of big errors is a disgrace . 
jones , rafael , vidic and carrick need to return asap . 
to many long ball 
central defending is very poor - opponents to easy straight through 
this ref i an utter wanker , their fans our annoying and that was a pen ! 
how is smalling a manchester united and england player ? someone explain .
boys come on we are manchester united .
yes earnshaw ! 
come on cardiff . beat 
chris smalling is not a full back 
does smalling look before he passes the ball ? 
campbell with a point prove 2nyt !!! 
manchester united is ass
we are far too slow !!! cmon 
rooney scores with a deflected shot . 1-0 
campbell haunting us , we still hold on , we are united .
smalling off . 
can't afford anything but a win 
manchester united !!
up watching cardiff city vs . manchester united
can see clearly in the replay that de gea calls evans a cunt . 
frazier campbell has a penchant for scoring against manchester clubs
ohhh shit 1-1 
goal campbell brings level after 35 mins . 1-1 
manchester united !!
 don't look up for this . losing all 50-50s . trouble .
what does tom cleverly do ?

 are making cardiff play them like its madrid , poor team
fellaini useless anywhere on the pitch kagawa should have played 
getting beasted 
gol cardiff cardiff 1-1 manchester united come on united
smalling gives the ball away too often 
cardiff city won against manchester city earlier this season .. 3-2 ..
chris smalling is a shocking player . couldn't pass wind . 
come on . keep possession & play how we know you can !
£27m for fellaini ? c'mon scottish albino .. i'll buy 1match diaby for £ . 01 instead . 
so we can challenge for every ball against the arsenal but not against cardiff !!!! sums up 
after 3 losses so early in the season , we cant afford to drop points at , 
announcers are awfully quick to write off manchester united in this match 
min 35 . gooool del cardiff ! campbell pone el empate . cardiff 1-1 manchester united
 manchester united - cardiff
in manchester ( extended talbot st. ) for the game with my city bro . not happy is understatement . dreadful . and i had tickets for the nz game
decent game this . 
tell you what , i just thought that was a great through ball from rooney and then welbeck put it in . then realised scored ! 
pleeeaaaase 
its so painful watching manchester united play football , they are horrible to watch now
glory glory manchester united
mufc in trouble ...... hahaha
we dey struggle badly this season mehn mufc
mad week . only spent 2 nights at my own uni - did a nice tour of manchester , durham and york :d
united making cardiff look like real madrid here . far to deep , no passing and no fight ! sort it out ! 
come on manutd .
cardiff city 1-1 man united cardiff have the wind in their sails , looking for a 2nd , couple of good attacks so far 
fellaini slow as a motherfucker 
39 - city with their tails up ! taylor picks out cowie with a near post cross , don stabs it over the bar . 1-1 
felliani has had a brain freeze ever since he took the motorway to manchester .
cardiff passing better then us .... says it all ... 
fraizer campbell scoring against ? saw that one coming from a mile away . 
its 1-1 between and but we all know which team is goin home wit all 3 pts 
mane they are playing manchester united ball
campbell : raping manchester defence since 2013
and felliani still looks as lost as little red riding hood 
fraizer campbell scores n doesnt want 2 celebrate . wht the spirit !! 
on me way back t ' penrith , manchester , its been nice
i mean if your midfield isn't world class then play with 3 in the middle and press high - it's not like are real fucking madrid !
i still don't know how smalling is a manchester united player
been one of fellaini's biggest backers , but the lads getting left for dead all over the pitch . 
 - manchester city rolls to 6-0 rout of tottenham ; sergio aguero , jesus navas 2 goals apiece
here's my list of manchester united players whom aren't shit : rooney
stop diving and get the job done . 
the man utd and england poor ball retention highlight the importance of michael carrick 
watching cardiff city vs manchester united ! keep it up !
surprise surprise , struggling in the middle of the park . anyone fancy playing centre mid ? 
manchester united ( y )
manchester united play boring football these days . what irritates me instead the foot n mistakes , it's the crap commentary by the french !!!
manchester united 1 vs 1 cardiff city
playing like a league two team . cant make a few passes together . wake the fuck up united . 
39 " gone and it's 1-1 . rooney opened the scoreline with a deflected shot , utd academy grad campbell equalised after a lapse from evans 
you have to admire evra's work-rate , commitment and desire . 
nasri delighted with " great result " at home : midfielder samir nasri believes manchester city are proving what they are capable of at ...
barca fan : i have a special type of hate for manchester united . they annoy the hell out of me .
lazy sundays in manchester are the best .
some how the women at the check in at manchester airport seem to love me haha 3rd time they just gave me speedy boarding for no reason
chris smalling is fucking awful !!!! 
smalling is not a right back 
fellaini weaknesses exposed by the mighty cardiff 
cardiff bossing utd here .. shower of shit 
go manchester !!
oh , fraizer campbell , manchester's nightmare .
chris smelling is not quality !!!!
need more ball possession ! 
nice finish from old boy fraizer campbell . 1-1 in cardiff
sunday morning epl action ! 
for me rooney gonna be ban by fa soon and he gonna miss the match against spurs and everton ... 
we have been fecking shite . 
lucky to have just cardiff as our opponents today . mid-field lapses like these against any top-half team would have been dreadful . 
campbell is a great striker . was gutted when he left , never had a chance to make it at united for various reasons . good finish 
if there's anything we need , it's a quality midfielder 
piss poor at moment 
goollll ... cardiff city 1 ( campbel 35 ' ) v 1 manchester united ( rooney 15 ' )
come on united ! 
keep calm and it ain't over yet . 
our january transfer market strategy should just be buy a centre mid who isn't cleverley 
we gonna start playing or not ? 
moyes out 
i can only see this game going one way at the moment 
get giggsy on .. fellini off never to return ... 
i just dey observe 
fellaini . can we get a refund ? 
far too slow in midfield ... missing carrick badly ! 
smalling's distribution is holding us back . we've done nothing down the right 
yet another extremely poor display so far - no decent midfield players - slow defenders - poor passing 
 have to win today !!
manchester united is leading by a goal to nil
smalling is playing terrible . what surprised me is were not even in the market for another right back to cover rafael ? 
on this day wrexham beat cardiff in 1981 3-1 , today cardiff play manchester united in the premier league ! what went wrong 
finished the german markets now in chinatown manchester . were trotting the globe in one city .
so come on david moyes , plays likr fergie boys .. were gonna wild wild wild .. were gonna wild wild wild ! 
why do these small teams give us so much head ache ? good grief !! c'mon you manchester united !! 
with that said cleverley didn't read the situation and cardiff went on to score . 
welcome to the epl , where manchester united gets every call .
manchester city completely trashed spurs . didn't see that coming
come on glory glory united
keep calm and support manchester united \m/ :d
and now pressure on manchester united . it's what you get away at a club who fear no one .
i hate fellaini he's so shit and a waste of time 
cardiff are actually playing the better football here . united look to be in sixes 
if had gone at the other week they'd have destroyed them ....
manchester full of shit !
manchester united ( y )
commentator blames cleverly for the goal say's that it would not have happened if carrick was there 
no desire from manchester united on the pitch .
tottenham well and truly ripped apart by manchester city this afternoon .
i really hope someone kills the glazers , woodward , ferguson and the rest of the board right now !!! 
frazier campbell loves to score against manchester teams
missed all the last min drama in d match .. o well .. i thought theyd see it out .. more annoyed bou campbell equilizing tbh 
poor poor 1st half from nobody playing at better than a 6/10 lucky to be level
it's hockey night in manchester !! puck drops in less than 50mins ! tickets are available on the door . watch the phoenix take on the bison .
glory glory manchester united
 
cleverley is united's weak link😞 
glory glory manchester united : *
fellaini is appalling . 
giggs ( nearly 40 ) on for januzaj i reckon 
i miss carrick ! 
manchester united's academy appears in cardiff with fraizer campbell's goal 
can't remember ever seeing smalling complete a pass ? his passing is awful 
quality goal by , love the confidence that they play with . taking on head to head .
too many average players these days handed manchester united strips .. not even near the standard expected at that club 
cant string 2 passes together . are u the defending champion 
get fellaini off now moyes !!! 
moyes out ! ginger cunt ruining the club 
glory glory manchester united ... !!
pull up ur socks 
 cardiff city vs manchester united 
looks like this could be another one of those games when we've got to throw the kitchen sink at them to rescue the game , hope not ! 
the way we play atimes sucks ! after watching 's match today , i'd admit we're still far ! 
unlike rooney's deflection , cardiff's goal was quality . just as the announcers were waxing poetic on how good mufc is .
has smalling actually completed a pass yet ? we're in blue today mate ! 
with ferdie in our backline and clevz in the middle we were always going to concede 75
cardiff goal came after hernandez gave the ball away due an awful touch despite no pressure on him . he has to do more with it 
manchester united in trouble . 
 are on top now and we need to get to half time level at least . 
i see another goal coming . .
massively missing carrick and vida 
manchester united lose their collective minds as soon as they are pressed high by the opposition . come on , fellas , lets relax ...
can manchester united ever keep a clean sheet ?
cardiff city vs manchester united
tom cleverley is playing somewhere today called " no mans land " 
cardiff versus manchester united
 cardiff vs manchester united (:
on the mulled wine again , good on ya manchester ! 
come on you united 
 center midfield is useless . time for a change
cardiff 1-1 manutd . come on the red devils .
fellaini is not a manchester united player 
cardiff are all over us , we don't look too great today 
desperately need a quality center mid-fielder ... all i want for christmas . 
manchester is blue no bale no win , spurs poor spurs #6 -0
now this game is magically & slowly turning into a nightmare 
for the good of the game soccer in particular muss lose 
keep calm & believe mufc
cleverley & fellaini . a midfield to strike fear an anxiety into .. absolutely not one fucking team anywhere . being dominated by cardiff 
especially as this is the supposed to be the season where video technology is pioneered . embarrasing compared to germany , france etc . 
comeon comeon united . 
fellaini is well out his depth at united ; big fish small pond at everton ; average at best .... not quality of manchester united
cardiff is making manchester united do work .
blame roy ( the old doll faced ) hodgson for this current uninspiring mf duo of ours . carrick and jones would have ripped cardiff apart . 
3,660 - the number of consecutive games that manchester united have had a home-grown youth player in their squad . 
same song , same dance . 
cheering something welsh cut me deep . then again , look who it's against 
luck manchester united . nite : *
we can't be struggling with abo cardiff when manchester city is beating totenham 6-0 lol 
a serious lack of defense from j . evans that cost cardiff to have an equaliser . united 1 - 1 cardiff 
manchester united
 go go manchester !!!
i thank my brother for waking me up just so i could watch the manchester game .
smalling not made one pass to his own team yet . fellaini looks scared to touch the ball . cleverley serves no purpose in life . wank 
goood job cowie continue killing birds like this and i will be ur fan ... :-d 
manchester city 6-0 tottenham ..
manchester is full of shit
golll de campbell . cardiff city 1-1 manchester united . 
come on lads ! 
calm down lads .. they are still our kids go 
doesn’t frazier-campbell look a bit like jamie foxx ? 
standing off , not competing for the ball .. second best again so far .. get the fucking finger out lads 
dreadful midfield . why did moyes buy this fellaini 
cardiff city is walking on top of us serious 
 goal ! cardiff city 1 - 1 manchester united
take smalling out for god sake . his mis passes and def horrible .
it's no shock when fellani plays we always get attacked and play snail football 
is it too late to get a refund on fellaini ? 
i knew campbell would end up scoring against us . united need to sort this out . 
cardiff city fc is playing at the pace of manchester united . this game in full of intensity .
glory glory manchester united come on united !
come on man utd sort your selfs out come on boys step it up you's can win this game if you's play it right 
how does young make the bench but not kagawa ?? i wouldn't be surprised if he left in january . 
someone please kill the glazers , woodward , fergie and the rest of the board right now !! i ean it !!! 
let's go 
i never like fellaini in manutd > . <
keeper joe hart will return to the manchester city team for their game against plzen on wednesday , according to manager manuel pellegrini
come on united !!!!!! 
oh dear felliani - you are making me drink gin 
why are all arsenal supporters supporting cardiff city instead of manchester united ? - . -
manchester is red ( y ) not blue ( n )
manchester is so pretty at night
fellaini not closing down & sliced open . cleverly & fellaini in central midfield ? on the move .
uniteds build up play , pass in defence , give fellaini pass to cleverley back to fellaini , pass to smalling , long ball . 
why van persie didn't play ? 
fellaini is fucking wank how is he worth 28million 
it's just not happening for adnan today 
sorry to say it again but fellaini offers united nothing , great goal from cardiff though . 
united playing absolute crap again . too many average players , that's the problem . 
what's happened to the beast of a player fellaini was at everton . don't think it suits him having cleverley in there with him . 
i still can't figure out why we signed fellani .. 
januzaj is trying too hard . needs to play his natural game . 
i thought i would never say this but i would rather prefer seeing giggs or anderson on at ht with fellaini . 
giggs has to come on for cleverley at half time . 
its sad how much we miss carrick 
 imbang 1-1 . huft
fellaini doesnt deserves to be a manchester united player
rooney ... come on manchester united
manchester city have scored 26 times and conceded only twice in their six league matches at the etihad stadium this term .
we can do better . much better . 
manchester city 6-0 tottenham from a canadian fan in kuwait " middle east " !!!!!!
as frazier campbell has scored anyone know what aaron burns and ramon calliste are upto ? 
cardiff want this way more than do ! fellaini and cleverley do not want the ball at all
fraizer " manchester " campbell
manchester beware , you'll no get campbell out your hair ! ?
yoo campbell score 2 vs manchester city n done score 1 vs manchester united 4manchester
manchester city win !! yeah
shit performance 
smalling , valencia , hernandez , fellaini , cleverley can't really pass the ball very well . 
no carrick cant keep the ball . worst performance of the season . i include city away in that 
 complacent again ! seems to be the story for man u . cant win the league like this need to step up a gear cardiff are up for it
let's go manchester united !
cardiff city 1 - 1 manchester united . 
come on you reds !!! 
 needs to step it up ......... turn up the heat !!!
fuck ! 
manchester city stun spurs with six-goal rout 
could this manutd side really finish outside of the top four , it does prove that fergie was a class manager no matter what you thought of him
every time i watch fellaini play , i realise how amazing arteta is ! huge difference 
cardiff just scored to tie the game with manchester united 1-1 . i'm hoping manu scores again quickly to take the lead back .
36 ' car 1-1 manutd . come on united .
why did we buy fellani ? 13voice
and we paid £27m for this stale tree ?? 
cleverley as effective for mufc as he is for england 
fraizer campbell has done it for me .. cardiff 1-1 manchester united !
i don't understand why we struggle to keep possession of the ball , even when under absolutely no pressure 
cardiff is making manchester united do work on the field .
at the minute valencia is a more effective defensive midfielder than fellaini ! 
i miss carrick ... 
can someone please give fellani a bus pass as he is late to every ball 
 whiskey tango foxtrot
 just made to pass to an opposition player -- kick that bitch out !!! 
heading to manchester
there's two ways to get football updates . 1 ) google now 2 ) twitter . manchester united vs cardiff city 1:1 first half
observations from today : chris smalling is a bit crap , united as a team look decidedly average & city look frighteningly good ... 
i was one of the ones who backed the fellaini signing .. think i was wrong tbh .. hasn't had the best of starts to his man utd career 
say here waiting for a taxi to take us the manchester to the concert ! first concert ever ! gonna be great !!!
with fellani and clevz in mid its like we're playing without any midfielders !! 
long way to go yet . .
we need anderson on the pitch . fellaini and cleverly are not creative enough . 
referee's are alwaysf for mufc
come on lads string a few passes together & excite the crowd don't keep giving the ball away 
the word ' manchester city ' has more letters than spurs have in goals this season
in essence , manutd is playing a back 4 made of evra & 3 cbs . no attacking threat existent from the right . sigh
hernandez hasnt had a touch of the ball in the last 20 minutes 
no rvp manutd such an old united
fellaini is actually really bad , can't keep possession and gives away needless fouls .. 
arsenal's former cardiff midfielder aaron ramsey cardiff 1-1 manchester united " great goal ... game on ." -ms
40 ' cardiff city 1-1 manchester united 
we don start rubbish be dat . i don't why we find it difficult to keep a clean sheet 
get fallaini off ! 
manchester united ??????????
we're gunna lose this 😡😡 boring sheep shagers 
we need to cash in on fellaini , take whatever we can get . anyone who rates him has never seen him or is a deluded idiot 
bring on the welsh wizard at h/time 
£27m ! i do a better job in midfield and i'd cost a tenner ! 
gary neville annoyed me so much as a united player , his face man , cheer up , was so glad he retired , now i gotta listen to the cunt 
no carrick no jones no rvp ... no vidic .. we are struggling 
manchester city released a short video of its players in some
cardiff overrunning the poorest midfield in the top half this weekend . can't remember the last time dominated play . 
manchester united players , plz complete more than 2 passes in a row .
smalling is atrocious at rb . fellaini & cleverley is a woeful midfield . januzaj trying to do too much . valencia & hernandez anonymous 
and ppl thought wig wud replace rooney . absolute rubbish so far for 
januzaj can't get into this game i'd bring nani on januzaj needs bit meat on him before playing against big built sides :( 
keep support manchester united 
 manchester united vs cardiff city 
fellani is fucking useless - headless chicken ... just good at fouling . 
get in ! all square between the red bluebirds and blue red devils ! no wonder the ref seemed colour blind when getting his cards out 
who is this bloke and why did we sign him again ?! 
wow ! you deny space in midfield and game is all yours . it's been a pattern this season . that's why herrera andfabregas were linked .
mufc lets goooo
everyday i jux pray fellaini proves me wrong ... he never does . 
manchester city won today so im in a great mood .
manchester united
might be going to manchester in december , oh yeah
no 31 is fuckin useless , cardiff vs manutd
was hoping for a clean sheet !!!! 
manchester united midfield is spelling doom for us .
cardiff ...... manchester united 1 - 1 40mins
what a really good goal from cardiff . y can't our midfielders play through balls like that ?? 
please manchester . i hope you win in the match
keep it togeather get to half time then give them a good smashing
smalling gives more balls away than katie price has ever done 
cardif 1 : 1 manchester utd . now , still live on sctv . 
cardif 1 : 1 manchester utd . now , still live on sctv . 
cardif 1 : 1 manchester utd . now , still live on sctv .

mutch looks like a mix between carrick and o'shea . 
cardif 1 : 1 manchester utd . now , still live on sctv . 
vfm wise fellaini poorest buy of last 25 yrs ? every cm has better players than him . what is it moyes has seen in him ? epl over today
a fantastic win for manchester city ; my husband will be " dancing in heaven ".
we can't have fellini and cleverly in m/f ? just can't ... they're both ......? 
manchester united 1 - 1 cardiff city . please win this match man u !
games like these you realise how much miss carrick when he's injured ! crying out for a calm head in midfield ! 
mufc getting dominated by a championship side 😕
could someone explain to me how cart horse fellini ended up . playing for man utd 
for the $$ paid for fellaini , he hasn't done what's been needed . what a waste . hopefully , he doesn't turn out like berbatov . 
cleverly is one of them lucky players , he shld be playing for norwich 
manchester united needs to get rid of david moyes , there are better managers than this pathetic balley .
safe too say i do not rate our summer signing walking around in midfield !!! he's absolute shite 
 needs to stamp his mark . 
manchester united vs cardiff city 
fellaini does my fucking head in . he's such a lazy player . no movement at all . look for the fucking space and help out . it's a joke . 
what a messy weekend !! manchester and leeds ! feeling tired now :(
oh dear felliani - you are making me drink gin without the tonic 
mid bila carrick ni mathogothanio 
cardiff looking the better team . not good for us ! 
os it just me or is fellaini doing absolutely nothing ? 
what has happened to the fellaini who terrorised us at everton ? 
i hate when london clubs lose to manchester clubs
fellaini has to be the worst signing have made for ages based on current form . absolute horseshit 
he didn't like that mutch . 
whatever your opinion of fellaini/cleverley , carrick's absence is huge for .
playing like shite as normal i see 
manchester city vs tottenham hotspur 3-0 . 45 ' kyle walker , yellow card , tottenham hotspur 
all i want for xmas is a new midfield 
c'mon mufc you can do it ..... all i want is a win for you !?!
gol cardiff cardiff 1-1 manchester united come on united
damn ! mufc misses carrick
miss scholes so much even when he was 35 plus he would be controlling this game 
seeing as ' pass completion rate ' is the current fashion , can someone tell me if this is lowest % of the season ? 
i'm not a pro footballer because i decided to concentrate on my education . but i'm better than those two idiots . 
fellaini trots around the pitch doing nothing . awful signing . in the team to win headers and he can't do that . 
can someone get fellani out . run you lazy bastard run . 1 - 1
not looking forward to getting up early tomorrow 
fellaini ? really ? he couldn't head a bus queue ...! 
big fan of jordan mutch but quality of the through ball disguised horrendous piece of defending from evans 
what's the point of fellani ? 
come on lads 
clerverlly is crap 
smalling's passing is sunday league standard . 
fellaini is absolute shit not mufc standard bugger off you bushy haired lanky bastard !
manchester city- tottenham 6-0
campbell knows how to score in big games ..... especially against manchester clubs ...
i've said it before and i'll say it again fellaini is a pile of shite ! 
just kidding . manutd is at an disadvantage
40 ' cardiff 0-1 
cardiff city 0-1 manchester united
manchester city goal difference +22 ... dats an yeartime of goals for some teams
using the manchester metro for the first time , its a lot cheaper than ours yay
rooney sinking deep 
40 ' - cardiff 1 - 1 ( campbell ; rooney )
 manchester united just are not the team they where , 2/3 years ago . no team seems to fear them anymore , a fall from grace ?
fellaini - someone tell me what he is ? 
41 - peter whittingham picks it up after a bit of head tennis in the area , but he just fires it over the bar . 1-1 
felliani is still at everton , hasn't arrived manutd yet
3 goals scored by in all în clubs
manchester united match !! glory glory ..!!
manchester united is play a very poor game
manchester united i pick u bc i know ur a chmapion
we have no composure or creativity in the midfield . we really do look a poor side ! 
cardiff need fi change dem jerseys cuz it a confuse mufc players
i hate to see play f***ing slow !
cardiff city 1 - 1 manchester united
manchester united can learn something from their noisy neighbours , city . like how to trash your opponents .
fellaini really needs to up his game . 
er der egentlig noget der hedder moyestime ? 
maaahn , i won't even tweet about this manutd game . /o\ cardiff were supposed to be an obvious cleen sheet .
manchester united have still not kept a clean sheet away from home all season .
manchester united got the worse midfield out of top teams in europe in my opinion
 dear stop strolling around as if it doesn't matter . thank you .
need to pick up our game and momentum to get ahead - let's go boys 
pretty sure i'm on my deathbed . my only wish is that giggs scores the winner 
the passes ain't even sticking !! c'mon manutd
so a former player scores against us . horrific defending .
we need control 
united need to sort out their defending , we should be winning this game like 4-0 , step it up united 
we're giving away the ball too cheaply . cardiff responded well after our goal . we need to keep the ball . 
manchester united sports max ...
manchester city hammer spurs 6-0
don't want to leave manchester yet ! wish i had the day off tomorrow 😔
cracking ball by mutch vs 
fellaini doesn't even look interested 
this ref in the man u game is complete crap . he doesn't even know what he is doing . 
formal manchester utd striker freizer campbell av level it up 4 cardiff city ..... game on 1-1
yet again , fellaini and cleverly might as well not be on the field . medel and co . have free reign . 
we need to sort out defensively ! 😬 
i can see us getting beat here . the way we are playing is shocking 
fellaini looks so clumsy and ineffective i hope moyes kept the receipt 
clearly we lack carrick's insight in the middle of the park 
 
ayoo glory glory manchester united !!
40 ' cardiff 1-1 
such a big gap between defence and midfield you can park one antonov there .
cleverley has been utterly disappointing . 
david de gea . spain's 5th choice goal keeper and somehow the most overrated goal keeper in the league . blows my mind ! 
challenge for the ball fellaini ! 
any fucking chance of fellaini challenging for a header !! 
poor defending by manutd .. lol
pakistan win , india lose , manchester city win and now waiting for manchester utd to lose 
same old static dry play from us . in desperate need of a playmaker 
" i don't like to say this but we're not the same side as last season ... even though we are the same team " 
cardiff city ( 1 ) vs manchester united ( 1 )
people don't like manchester united because they win things nearly every year
waking up to see the score manchester city 6-0 over tottenham has made my day 
cardiff will never have a better chance if beating manchester united .
is he out for the manchester clubs , cos i see him gett'g another one .
fellaini if you don't want to play for manutd pls leave in january ... wat is all this😡
manchester united you really need serious training !
rooney !! a hat trick please ! am i expecting too much ? 
can some one please buy fellani as he is totally shit 
so manchester cuntited are saved by the referee and webber gets screwed over by his pit team ... all is normal in world sport .
mufc are well off the pace just now . they need to pick it up to prevent them going the way of their neighbours .
mufc !!
why aren't we challenging bloody hell lads come on 
manchester united have now gone nine premier league away games without a clean sheet . sketchy .
giggs shud of started . 
both our left sided players are too " one footed " that we lose that extra dimension 
fellani is jst 2 useless 2 be in manutd's starting 11 .
mufc take lightly by not put in van persie . wow , how great . ivy league killer . we need this atmostphere 
35 ' goooooooolll de campbell . cardiff 1-1 manchester u . 
 come on united
someone pump a ball up and give united a touch , cardiff are smashing us ! up the game 
1506 glasgow ctl to manchester apt due 1847 : is being delayed at carlisle .
1410 edinburgh to manchester apt due 1747 : will be terminated at oxenholme .
glory glory manchester united~
we are manutd we do what we want
fellaini on a free in the january transfer window anyone ? please ? 
cardiff 1-1 manautd 41 ' 
this ref is so bad . many missed calls . but other than that this is a great game ! 
i better stop watching this game before manutd puts me in hospital ...
again fellani gets out jumped 4 a header what was he bought for ? 
it's a tough one because i like david moyes but i really dislike manchester united .
united getting dominated and outplayed by cardiff smh 
fellaini is a waste of a manchester united jersey .
not for the first time this season man utd lacking creativity . not something cleverly or fellaini can offer . 
rumourfact : fellaini plays with a bluetooth headset & is currently on hold to united utilities . better doing it on works time , innit ? 
what does mop top actually bring to he's not a play maker , not a holding player not an enforcer not an attacking player , he's a mess
manchester united
it's been said before but …… centre midfielders are needed ! carrick injury shows a clear lack of ability in the cover players 
also , fellaini needs to value possession better . 
 is having an awesome game for 
fellaini is not manchester united material .
cardiff giving manchester a hard time ..
manchester united ☆
for some one who always won the ball in the air against us , the bastard has never won it for us !!! 
how did the mf go from giggs , keane , scholes and beckham to this ? saf surely has to take blame for that
manchester cunts lol bt i knw youll pull one back
 fellatio is a waste of time . what is supposed to be doing ? running around like fucking headless chicken
ashley young & giggs on at ht please ! 
 desperately missing carrick
training , then tea out in manchester 👌
ths is not , cnt watch 4days
fellaini + cleverly is like watching the nfl before the forward pass . 
how are we playing ? judging by some of the tweets i'm assuming shit ? 
i was a big advocate of us signing fellaini in the summer . not embarassed to say i got that wrong . simoly shocking 
we will win this guys !! calm it !!! 
let's go into half time with a goal up atleast #3pointsplease . 20ns 
i say again ... what does fellaini offer the midfield ? big waste of 27million 
cardiff city vs manchester united ..... ;) ggmu <3 <3
this manchester united team that's playing right now is absolutely muck
fraizer campbell scoring against his former club ! show how its done lad ! 
manutd shocking ! too many not good enough ! moyes needs to get shot of atleast 5 from this line up
we have plan a and if that don't work then it's plan a with giggs chucked on . 
all summer waited to sign fellani .. what has he done besides give away free kicks and receive a red card . 
our midfield is shit , can't defend , can't attack , can't hold the ducking ball . desperately crying out for a creative player 
manutd r playing like passes ... can't make 4-5 passes
manchester united !!
heads up boys !!! 
no snack , no coffee . but still watching manchester united ! 
ole ole .. cardiff 1 - 1 manchester united .. steady monyets ..
manchester united - you are ridiculous .
never seen fellaini lose a header at everton , never seen him win one at 
that international break came at the wrong time for us it seems . 
fellaini gets worse every time he plays for about as shit off the ball as he is on it . cleverley is arguably worse
stop . giving . the . fucking . ball . away 
championship team playing us off the pitch . fellaini and cleverly are not up to it at this level 
fellaini doesn't even look like a footballer , let alone a £27million one ! 
manchester united's £27million flop " fallain " 
come on ! where's that attack , where's that pressure we controlled in the first 30 minutes ? ? come on ! vs 
another glorious win for manchester united
i've always sed there's no way some players should be playing for manutd .. evans , smalling , cleverly .. too average to be utd players ..
fellaini has literally lost every important header . surely his only attribute ? 
" 40 cardiff city 1-1 man utd come on united !! 
manchester united 
need to be getting myself up to manchester soon
januzaj thinks he can go past everyone , 5 players at a time . very selfish , foolish . 
the manchester christmas markets are so unbelievably pretty !
loathe as i am to criticise , fellaini and cleverly in midfield , for manchester united .....
cleverly and m.f have gone way beyond losing the midfield battle 
it's obvious that we're missing carrick . 
can't wait for christmas market with the parents ❄️🎅🎄
manchester united need an experinced player like scholes in mid field .. not a piece of shit lije fellini ... 
i would never of paid 27 pence for fellaini never mind 27 million ! all he does is foul players and doesn't even win balls in the air . 
the only thing that could possibly make this match more boring would be commentary by michael owen ! 
if you're a manchester united ' fan ' and you call them ' man u ' then you're not a fan ...
does someone want to let fellaini know he is allowed to join in ? 
cleverly and fellaine are wank 
fraizer campbell is a product of manchester utd's youth academy , they sold him £ 3.5 m to sunderland . sunderland sold him £ 650,000 to cardiff
our noisy neighbors are raping a top 5 side and are opening up for cardiff ..
cardiff city - manchester united 
manchester city rape tottenham hotspur , lol . six and the city again !
if cleverly is a central midfield i'm a greyhound . woof woof !!!!!
we can't really expect to win games with a cleverley-fellaini midfield , can we ? none of them are good enough to play for .
i tweet again cardiff teach manchester mpira
i really want to see manchester united do well this season , for david moyes ' sake . maybe not title , but well !
putting it out there , cleverley shouldn't be deployed in the carrick role . i'd rather see anderson in there ! 
can't believe the yids suffered a loss to the manchester wanks today ! 
we are winning this match 
playing 2 vs 3 in midfield again . that rarely works nowadays . 
the manchester christmas market with so good
what does fellaini bring to us apart from slowing every single attack down ? 
manchester united are winning their match 2day , no doubt
fraizer campbell loves playing against manchester clubs
glory glory manchester united~
41 ' manchester united 1-1 cardiff
maroune fellaini cost mufc £ 27.5 m . * raised eyebrow *
my eyes are starring at the ( mute ) tv [ cardiff vs mufc] , and my ears are listening to ride with me 
cardiff dangerous at set pieces so far , ripping the back 4 apart ! 
dunno why rio ferdinand is still playing for manchester united . we've given him his testimonial match already . time to retire . 
can fellani even jump 
come on the only team u must b scared of is . if we could beat so can u . sorry ccfc don't have the confidence i think .
ball to the back post don't even jump for it wtf at everton he owned all air space 
glory glory man united 
too many average players in united's squad these days . we need to ring in some star quality in the midfield especially . 
we're in for a long hard slog with this midfield of ours . second best to every ball and little creativity 
we are lacking in midfield again . cleverly needs to get his passing game going 
campbell cant stop scoring against manchester clubs .
we are actually being bossed by our midfield is one giant hole !! 
mcfc doing six and mufc doing mcbc : |
when did fellaini have more than 1 memorable game for everton for him to be bought by have him back , swap for barkley in january
glory glory manchester united
gooolll campbell 33 ' ( cardiff 1 - manchester united 1 )
without carrick we have such a poor midfield . cleverley is useless & can't shoot , pass or has no presence , as for fellaini why bother 
had an awesome time at manchester christmas market and catching up with good friends ! 🎁🎄🎅
we need to be back in dis game , c'mon boyz !!! 
say it every time ... chris smalling is an awful right full back . 
what a waste of money !! 
what ? manchester city 6-0 tottenham spurs
" haiqal support both of team united & . but he's still mu supported "
is fellani capable of winning a tackle 
 - encerrado : manchester city 6x0 tottenham em andamento : cardiff 1-1 manchester united
5 ' min left before half time . 
for fuck sake take that cunt fellaini off !!! 
really struggling without carrick pulling the strings in mid 
we are missing players who can hold up play ! 
mufc subs bench is basically the transfer list .
fellani off please . 
so the cardiff equaliser was scored by former united player campbell i sense a few more twists & turns in this game 
united have gone to sleep . 
fellaini , the wandering jewfro 
manchester united !
who the fucks don cowie to manchester united , fuckaaaaf
 on top of ... cmon 
adnan januzaj | manchester united fans | cardiff 1 - 1 united ' 33 campbell

i just wishtyphoon haiyan had swept the glazers , woodward , fergie and the rest of the scummy board away !! 
cardiff vs . manchester united all day ⚽️👍
oh my lord , tottenham got destroyed by manchester city .
giggs has to come on for cleverley at half time . .
i want manchester united to lose this game ! retweet if you also fancy that ! can't wait for the fans !
campbell . great consolation . who knows ? both manchester teams go to cardiff and get beat ? unlikely !... but , who knows !
cardiff 1-1 man . utd . lol . hoping david ' i don't know what i'm doing ' moyes lose today ! 
manchester united likes to play a game called how long can we go with out playing defense .
really hope cardiff slaughter manchester united , would top off my weekend🎊🎉🙌
smalling growing in confidence here 
 manchester united vs cardiff city . 1-1
mufc smellose
what happened to our defence ... i mean the one that been there the last six games 
no real penetration from in midfield . would be good to see ando at some stage , apparently he's got his fitness back
need to up our game ! 
we stay united ! no matter what . manchester united .
min . 42 cardiff 1-1 come on reds !!!!
very very open game ! cardiff on top ! come on mufc !
come on mufc , you beat arsenal just 2 weeks ago ..
the chris smalling passing masterclass ..... " i just smash it as hard as possible in a general forward direction when i get the ball " 
 wapewe kichapo cha doggy
keep calm 
its in such games where players like anderson would be so lethal . 
 used to bitch us every time he played against us . what went wrong ? hes awful , always giving it away & can't win a header 
worrying that we can't seem to string five passes together at the minute . 
switched the football on just in time to see cardiff equalise 🙈 
golll de campbell . cardiff city 1-1 manchester united . "
another game showing how shit our midfielder is 
manchester united v cardiff . a rather good game so far .
hernandez looks lost 
its all roy carroll's fault 
that sums up adnans day so far 
on the run of okay so far i'm assuming are the team in red , that's right isn't it :-) 
haters gonna hate but united army gonna keep reds flag flying high 
wow been to manchester xmas market , puts leeds to shame
smalling is doing really good 
manchester united : *
glory ... glory ... manchester united . m.u day
felliani is clueless wat is happening in the game .. no one bossing arnd midfield like carrick use to do 
unusual third kit colour combo by . rather looks like manchester united - red jersey and black shorts .
our mid field is just crap without carrick . 
manchester city rolls to 6-0 rout of tottenham ; sergio aguero , jesus navas 2 goals apiece ( espn )
said it all week , this isn't gonna be easy ! 
evra plays so stupidly these days .. he knows he gat no competitor unlike in france . 
fellaini the worst signing for manutd , a liability even the players don't seem to want to pass it to him !
this is embarrassing 
cardiff please rape manchester united ... make u give dem bout 3 more babies .
cleverley would not get in to the afc wimbledon team oh he is in the england team ? why ? 
common mufc !!
we really do look all over the place . cleverley and fellani is as weak a central midfield pairing as i've seen for years 
come on 
we need to do a better job of keeping possession and the passing has to be more accurate . 
 well dine manchester college great brosdcasting
frazier campbell , raping manchester clubs since 2013
januzai has been poor first half ! 
the fuck was that :d 
come on lads your better than this time to go up a few gears 
not such a dominant force these days cardiff playing well though with a really well taken goal
c'mon mufc !!
might be a long second half at this rate . a goal for us now would ease this pressure . .
glory glory man . united .. !!! 
glory glory manchester united ;;)
it takes cleverly 5 touches with the outside of his foot to turn round . 
i ; ve seen the most beatifull football ever by manchester city today vs the spurs since the barcelona age with guardiola ! great football !!
 in manchester ... 20th anniversary - the excitement has taken over me !
come on manchester united . let's do this !! 
come on you lads . 
manchester united xi : david ; chris , rio , jonny , patrice ; marouane , tom , antonio ; wayne , adnan , javier . > =)
goal ! cardiff malaysia 1-1 manchester utd ' 35 campbell
campbell amezoea manchester teams ...
januzaj needs to send players on the run faster , this is ridiculous . 
need two centre midfielders in january ! midfield is shite . fellaini not even there , cleverly can't pass further than 2 yards . 
3 goals by campbell against manchester clubs so far
id have fletcher on instead of cleverley . hard worker , can actually pass a ball to create a chance , unlike cleverley 
42'min : cardiff city 1-1 manchester united ( w . rooney 15 ' ) ( f . campbell 33 ' ) 
medel is a great player like 
fellaini has got to be man united's worst signing in 5 years . 
beat cardiff and grab the fourth place ✊ 
the fact that fellaini isn't even bothering to challenge for headers is really starting to annoy me ... 
 midfield is struggling without carrick
manchester united
oh manchester is wonderfull is full of tits fan and united oh manchester is wonderfull
i'd play a 50yrs old giggs any day over any age shit cleverley 
ffs 4th place beckons , get it together ffs
i still can't believ mufc used the entire summer transfer to buy this trash with afro 
can fellaini and cleverly both get subbed off at halftime , fellaini is a fucking waste 
tom cleverly is not a footballer 
januzaj has to be sent off ! fast ! 
ha ha .. doing sunday league impressions ..
i'll definitely be calling my children theophile and catherine 
- manchester is playing like some shit
have never seen a player look more out of his depth than fellaini ... strolling around the pitch doing f all ... embarrassing !
4christmas is tom cleverley & antonio valencia to be sold 
i would like to see cleverly and anderson in midfield together sometimes in second half 
i can see ryan giggs savouring the situation ... he's leaking his lips ; looking anxious to come on . 
fellaini is dreadful . 
 is making me bite my lip ....
out defence is terrible , come on united sort it out ! 
cardiff 1-1 manchester united - fraizer campbell ( 33 mins )
manchester united !! 
ac milan linked with manchester city for a balotelli/jovetic swap . do you think this is possible ?
when work is slow it's time to change it to the manchester united game .
great run by januzaj . 
manchester united need to buy barkley quick .
keeper joe hart will return to the manchester city team for their game against plzen on wednesday , according to manager manuel pellegrini "
fellaini has noo clue wht he's doing ! he's lookin lost ! c'mon united 
if fellaini isn't gonna win headers in our own box then i don't know wat the point of even having him on the pitch is . 
what the hell is this match !!! wat i am watching !! playing like a amateur .. boys get ur arse up n show car who r the boss 
pay 27.5 mil for a player that does no more than anderson 
 just got energized after equalizing . is a bad omen . even everton is above 
we're really missing carrick in the midfield 
mufc's wing play is non-existent .
need to change from shitty 442 useless even more so when cleverly plays 
rooney first goal at 6/1 , cheers . now for a united win to complete my manchester double !
i think that real fellaini never left everton ! we have this guy who looks like him !!! awful display from him !!! 
 have now gone 9 away games without a clean sheet . 
fellaini is non existant ... too slow going back , bad positionally ... just not good enough 
januzaj needs to pass the ball and stay on his feet 
januzaj isn't up for it today and fellaini is just wondering as usual . 
glory glory 
januzaj has over done it 2/3 times already today ... behave lad you're not ronaldo , no matter how many people want you to be . 
sape tgk , atch manchester united vs cardiff city ?
why why
whatever he does no one will ever convince me fellaini is good enough for mufc !!! 
fuck manchester united !!
back in manchester
( cambell ) cardiff 1-1 manchester united ( rooney )
ayo mu ! dolly dolly manchester united !! 
fellani a wrong signing for manchester united .
chris smalling , i like you 
no movement at all . terrible ball retention . no creativity . 
how can moyes look at this team and say " good enough for manchester united standards "???
if fellani doesn't make with mufc , he could be a hair double for troy polamalu in head and shoulders ads . 
can we sub hernandez then bring him back on in the last 10 mins 
gotta stop passing to the mufc home kits . come on , let's score one before the half .
 need 2 change his boots do3 
fuck cardiff and manchester united .
american manchester united fans suckkk 
can't say i'm surprised . i was actually expecting manutd to concede first with that choice i'm midfield .
the game isn't too bad for mufc tho
januzaj needs to pass the ball more 
metrolink single track at the sunnen and maplewood manchester stations until 4 p.m. today . blue line- 5 minute delays .
fellali is still amused he's playing for manchester untied , all he does is watch , wondering what d fool is watching !!
being a manchester united fan this season is a very risky affair
put the ball into their net lads !! 
weak midfield for . loosing a lot of balls in the middle . /giggs needed
januzaj's had a testing half . all part of the learning process . 
ramalan cardiff city 3-2 manchester united . hehe
woke up the sweet sounds of manchester united and cardiff . nice kick-off to the day . 
we're such a boring side to watch 
manchester united is single handedly giving me grown man tear drop every wknd . salute .
what a shambles ! all season we have constantly given the ball away in stupid areas , get giggs on at half time ! 
we are too slow to anticipate and losing the 50/50 balls , are just all over 
10% all dior including jadore , miss dior , fahrenheit and all make up !! starting this tuesday in debenhams manchester x
great shopping weekend at manchester xmas markets 💗👠🌂👍🍸
how long's left in the game ?
i really feel we need to revamp our defence 
being ashley young must suck 
no luck at all 
fellanni really hasn't impressed since arriving at united . 
£ 3.5 m to 650,000 from manchester united to cardiff via sunderland , that's campbell for you
smalling is shit 
missing mucheal . 
who's seeing avenged in manchester on saturday ? i want to meet some of you guys
 cardiff city - manchester united
glory !!!
cardiff city 1 : 1 manchester united > =) | rooney | cambell
finally have someone i can text while watching manchester play💁💕
do you we ever have a fit eleven ? 
those fans who support gud futbol teams .. smh
manchester , where's the defense ? vidic & jones are needed . gagawa > januzaj
always back united players but fellaini's played in england for a few years now but just doesn't look up to it for 
fun living at apartment hotels manchester : szc
fellaini is playing below average 
9 - manchester united have now gone nine premier league away games without a clean sheet . sketchy ."
i think moyes needs to borrow the hair dryer . they are sloppy , not linked up and lacking energy . certainly missing van persie
have united missed carrick in the middle of the park today ? 
my favorite restaurant in manchester ! 
fellaini ... manchester uniteds troll
a performance reminiscent of moyes ' everton team . hardworking but creating nothing . fellaini for 27m is an insult . 
carrick tak main hilang seni manchester united main . ish
i would hate to play hide and seek with . if he can hide in the middle of a football pitch , he can hide anywhere 
this is when kagawa is needed ! 
poor 
januzaj hasnt been upto his game . and our midfield isnt connecting with defence . we need to win this at any cost . pull ur socks u asap 
missing that cm willing to get forward and join the play 
we must win sha , no matter what ! 
we can't afford 2 loose disone 
not the best of halves from . very sloppy in midfield and our players overrun the ball on many occasions . we miss carrick & jones .
why do i get the feeling mufc will snatch this with a goal from hernandez ......
remember when used to have brilliant wingers ? :/
come on manutd ! a win is a must ! :d
had a good day in manchester yesterday😊
the fact is , rooney shd be off d field& mufc down to ten men but d reality is rooney got a yellow card & scored a goal ! 
hard to believe its not scholes , its cardiff , you know . 
do the best mu 
last team to win on my 6 fold accumulator is . come on man utd you're playing rubbish .
januzaj is young , what's fellaini's excuse ?? 
januzaj has gotta start playing small triangles . make a pass and move into space . they are closing him down too easily . 
cardiff city playing in red and manchester united playing in blue . 
43 ': manutd dominated btr opening 20 mins and cardiff city have dominated the last 20 . 
not a very good 1st half display to many passenger's atm for me 
fellaini going thru motions doesnt want the ball
they may be defending champions but , this is a very average manchester united side ...
still can't believe how we could lose against this manutd team 😔
i fucking hate when rio goes for his shitty long ball .. 
can't say i'm surprised . i was actually expecting manutd to concede first with that choice i'm midfield . 
our defence is terrible , come on united sort it out ! 
januzaj needs to change his boots , cleverley needs to get off the pitch and moyes needs to find a hair dryer ! 
come on united !! ffs smalling needs to get a grip & januzaj's been taking lessons from nani 
why have we got fellani he just a waste of space 
how the fuck did cleverley become a manchester united midfielder ? he's better off a banker in suits ... ( ˘˘̯)
 is playing wiv 10 players ... felliani just dey stroll like pregnant man
come on boys ! 
we'll take the lead back soon . come on you reds ! 
manchester united is too big for fellaini to handle
the fact that anderson doesn't start and fellaini does baffles me 
manchester united
manchester united~
is hernandez going to retweet that he needs to play more after this ? 

missing out on the game because of my uncle and the match
don't know why david moyes left everton their midfield is so much better then manchester . united's 
39 - city with their tails up ! taylor picks out cowie with a near post cross , don stabs it over the bar . 1-1 
manchester playing ! 
bullshit !!! 1-1 . cmoon manchester !!
i think are doing well drawing at seen as they've got that bushy haired bloke they've picked from a sunday league side
fellaini and cleverley is possibly the worst centre midfield partnership for united , since djemba djemba and kleberson . 
in moyes we trust ! 
i have another problem best friends sound like it's live and like it did at the janoskians show in manchester when i went and now i'm sad
manchester is full of shit . it's full of shit , shit , and more shit . oh manchester is full of shit !
we seriously need a new midfielder in january 
 will bounce back for sure .
rooney getting deeper and deeper . so more and more isolation for chich . and fellaini doing naff all . medel is doing the trick for them 
all eastbound trains on blue line are departing 5 min early until 4pm from shrewsbury , sunnen and maplewood manchester stations .
 has gone from a player who gave problems to a player who is causing problems 
only rooney and januzaj doing anything for us . easily need 3 new players in jan . easily 
screech from saved by the bell and tom not so cleverley are shockingly shit midfielders , not untied standards 
i guess we don't know the definition of a clean sheet ... 
what's the point of fellaini ? sauntering ball-watcher who cant tackle or pass ... 
i wouldn't be too disappointed if hernandez did leave - good goal poacher and generally offers very little
 keep going manchester !
come in ! x
hate to say it but the messiah ( januzaj ) as been poor thus far . 
campbell has something against manchester teams it seems .
this manchester united ... smh ... against cardiff ? smh
come on man . 
the only reason i can see for manu in buying fellani is incase rooney needs another hair transplant . 
the hatred of tweets when we aint winning for the team and players is appalling 
i have faith on my team . 
 
i wouldn't of paid 27 pence for fellaini never mind 27 million ! all he does is foul players and doesn't even win balls in the air . 
is this ? lazy players like fellaini and cleverly show the world u lazy bastards
rooney rooney rooneyyyyyyyyy :d
if any 1 of you shits say januzaj is not a good player , then you must be really dumb . he's 18 and on manchester united . i don't see u there .
brilliant shot ! manchester united are leading with two goals . car 1-2 mu . 
it's a corner to manchester
for moyes please spend in the winter transfer window 
manchester united
i swear man utd better come back and win !!!! 
first half win don dey go ooo 
manchester united is so unorganized .....
cleverly good with them crosses 
if you translate the word ' smalling ' into german , its ' shite ' 
strange to say it but rafael ( a right full ) is the player we miss most in attack . smalling just doesnt offer anything going forward . 
evra ! get in there . :)

not great by any stretch of the imagination , but we're winning so i'll take it 
this chant ' handball ' that the fans keep going with is quite simple yet very catchy . great work whoever came up with it ! 
don't think i've ever said this but i think ashley young should come on

captain evra . ah loves united ! beast of a header ! :d 
2-1 on first half for 
manchester united lead ! 
manchester united keep us waiting , we never get tension
fellaini is extremely average and by that i mean that he is actually shite .. gives the ball away far too much and a very clumsy tackler 
booooooooooooom perfect time to score , right before half time cos that'll be all cardiff will think about at half time 
perfect time to score ! just before halftime !!! second half won't be a child's play ; let cardiff city know the sheriff's in town !!! 
when all you're moaning about is rooney you deserve to be losing cardiff . don't think de gea has had much to do anyway 
fellani might aswell be on cardiff's side the amount he's passing straight to them 
half time : cardiff 1-2 manchester united
evra you fucking animal ! now bring on giggs & welbeck , get janazaj & that curly headed fuck fellani off !

ht cardiff 1-2 manutd , lacking creativity that first half but still edging 2 goals to 1 , gotta put up more of a fight in the 2nd though
if i was moyes . i'd get rid of cleverley , fellani , jones and welbeck there all a waste of space to be honest 
fellaini might want to be a dm but he is not a dm ! 
that wonderful moment when fraizer campbell scores n doesnt want 2 celebrate . wht the spirit !! 
we have been absolutely dire ! major improvements needed in the squad ! need to get rooney signed up to a new deal too !

wayne rooney involved in both goals , when he should have been sent off in the first 10 minutes . do we need video refs ? 
in all honesty i no longer find it enjoyable to watch manchester united 
as good as cicharito is for manchester u , it seems he is a match changer and not a match starter . he reads the game better from the bench .
fellaini is soooo annoying either acts like he's in slow motion or stuck like a statue sort it out fellaini

patrice evra has scored 7 pl goals for , 5 of them headers .
gary medel's a helluva mf but he got caught sleeping on the goal evra should never have got onto the end of that corner 
poor from mufc . no energy from back to front . really don’t get playing 4-4-2 here . play 4-2-3-1 . giggs on for chico . shore up the centre .

premier league : commentator stated about manchester united " they don't play well & yet find a way to get results , that's inner resilience ."
half time 2-1 goals from rooney and evra , bring on the 2nd half ♥♥ 
good first half .. thank god rooney calmed the fuck down .. 
powerfull header from captian patriceeeeee gave united the lead . 
lovely header from pat 
their are a few words for what we have seen from manutd & the ref , which sky are struggling to say ... 
 // cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united !!!!!!!!!!
keep up to date with everything manchester here ..... we love to party
h.t. lead 2-1 v lucky to remain on the pitch but took his goal well & with a bullet header . 
2-1 what a goal evra and smashing cross from rooney 
sums it up that rooney's corners are pretty accurate . 
 not good enough performance but good result till now
rooney - should have gotten a red card ( got a yellow ) - scored - assisted scintillating 1st half 2-1 cardiff 
ht cardif 1-2 united 
first half ends , cardiff city 1 , manchester united 2 .
i'll fancy mangala , garay , herreira & koke as utd's january addition . 
wow !! manchester city 6 - tottenham 0 . :)
last night was up there with one of the best i've had ! 
yes its true that evra scored , but he is still a dirty nigger slave 
because evra is short there is little to no focus on him at set pieces but man does he make them count ! 
roooooney 8 goals 8 assists enough said ⚽️ 
awesome weekend . now to pack the car and get back up to manchester for another week .
yes evra . yes . we don't neeeeeed baines . 
glory glory manchester united
nice 4 manchester united
quite what fabio ( a ucl final fullback ) has done to be behind smalling at rb or buttner on the bench is anyone's guess . 
hope united can hang on the lead . 2-1 . 
half time vs dengan score 1-2 ( campbel , rooney , evra )
smalling = useless at right back . fellaini = useless anywhere on the pitch . 
ht 1-2 rooney - possible red ? then involved in both goals . controversial ... and a brilliant goal from 
c'mon 
 manchester city player jesus navas just scored the fastest goal ( 13 seconds ) in the english premier league this season "

januzaj should try and shoot from distance 
so lets see , if this was the ref by rights should give the win to cardiff .... yeah right ! if you win , you win , no question 
no matter how much speculation there is around baines , shaw and coentreo , no one will ever give more for than big paddy evra

be calm .. we're about to enter d top 4 where we belong with or without sir alex 
i wish 5sos did more shows in the uk in places other than london like manchester :(
gotta love evra ! 
saved by the whistle 
i had a look at the rooney incident . he should be off , red card worthy .... but i am on for coupon win so don't mind really ha ha 
wdf ! manutd mustn't win dis match
ht well done lads ! 
januzaj has to be taken off early , its not his day . he is loosing the ball too easily . 
evra is one of those players that if you play left back you've just gotta look up to 
somehow , no one in midfield to control the game for 
keep calm & united we stand !

 need to do something bout this defence , we are shipping in way too many goals
keeper joe hart will return to the manchester city team for their game against plzen on wednesday , according to manager manuel pellegrini
wayne rooney has scored three goals in his last four away premier league appearances . 
ht : malaysia 1 vs 2 manchester united , campbel , wazza , evra . come on you red =)) b-) 
ok first half was a mixed bag of sweets ups & downs & need to raise there levels & the defence needs to sharpen up 
without vidic , rafael , carrick , jones , kagawa & rvp - any win shall do ! 
 manchester united will win :p night
cardiff had a better half . our midfield hasn't been convincing . missing carrick maybe ? 
as i said before its hard to play without vidic , jones , and especially carrick .. all we have to do now is to save this win 
we are not playn like champions ... we need to show other teams we r champions . 
it was hard watching spurs deplete earlier but it would be even much harder to look at the table if cardiff hold up for a result vs .
and thats a goalllll !!! such an excellent header from patrice evra that makes united to take the lead . united 2 - 1 cardiff 
lets go manchester united !!! 2-1 half time
i think evra has already done enough this season to convince moyes that he is the correct man at the left-back position ! 
fantastic header by patrice evra to give a 2-1 lead at half against 
ht : cardiff 1-2 manutd ( 15 ' rooney , 33 ' campbell , ' 45 evra )

evra's one of the few united players who kisses the badge means it . shame he's not a few years younger , top-class going forward . lw ? 
we are badly missing jones/carrick and rvp 
had to finish some chores so missed first half . decent game ?

i wonder if i'll evra remember the name of that french full-back that plays for manchester united .
if he comes , baines will have to be one hell of a player to replace pat judgin wot seen so far from fellaini , won't hold my breath .
fellaini is the midfield version of berbatov - talent . just walks around . never track runs . doesn't close down fast enough . 
cardiff 1-2 manchester u . 
rooney a lucky boy to be on . he's scored and created since then . always the way it goes 
mufc !
go manchester united ! 
and we are back in the game 
captain patrice evra scores in his 350th appearance for manchester united and tops it off by kissing the united crest . perfect . 
januzaj , cleverley & felliani need to step up their performance on the second half for us to get all the 3 points 
1 goal 1 assist . 
the quality of midfield right now at is just comedic .

fraizer campell is a product of manchester united youth academy . can moyes buy him back .
so man utd 2-1 up at half time with two ogs and rooney should be sent off how do they get away with it 
if accent was indeed the requirement to get the job , malky would have been a great choice . 
once upon time the other manchester side come off the second-best at welsh . could it recur again to other side ? hope it was dejavu .
a vibrant start by united , thou we scored first but the equaliser by cardiff was a proper defensive error . need to act ! 
smalling and fellaini are shits today 
the word clean sheet is no longer in manchester united dictionary .
so frustrating when cant keep the tempo up when they take the lead , going into half time winning buh need to play better in midfield !
fair 1st half , but we need a better second half if we're to hold them off . 
now my manchester united team is winning to wat a great in sport !!!
common united 
united !... man united . 4eva 4life rep'n the red side of manchester to the fullest no matter the cost .
fuck manchester united
damn ! i hate that i'm missing watching rooney play . 
missed my train at manchester . extra half hour wait . piss .

interesting first half . manchester united need to improve a lot in areas but i'll take a 2-1 win for the game
hoping januzaj improves to avoid the possibility of young coming on . 
so happy .. i waited for defender goals for longer this season i remember last season by october last season evra and evans were scoring 
too bad i can't watch man utd match :( will support them anyway . glory glory manchester united ! 
united so slow at the back . without carrick there's absolutely nobody providing any cover . 
let me go get ready for church , i'm in a better mood now . 🙏🙏 
cardiff 2-1 manchester united 
i do not understand why moyes keeps playing smalling at rb , he is a cb and rafael is so much better , especially going forward 
4th position , 5 points behind arsenal and 1 point behind liverpool isn't a bad spot to be in

jst 4 adverts 33sports : someone just said paid £27 million for marouane fellaini's hair . ”
memo to fans : most of us wished we spent like in the summer . it didn't stop them from conceding 6 unreplied goals at 
moyes has finally learned a trick or two from saf - buy the referee and your player won't be sent off no matter what . 
lol dad and 50 other blokes from dawkins are going up to bredbury hall in manchester , that's gonna be mega session

 doing nothing for my health . just drunk 4 litres of diet coke in the first half to calm the shakes

everything januzaj is trying isn't coming off today . when it does he will produce . 
 doing what they excel at not playing well but getting results - and referee decisions !
manchester united y vettel
manchester town is so much better at night🙌
 not playing very soild . they are looking very wobbly & shakey .
can't wait to go shopping in january in manchester 
disjointed in the first half , somehow manage to go in 2-1 up . playing without our only good midfielder , carrick . no rvp too .
united fan right now : midfield ! whats that ??? 
evra , 350 games for and he brought the goods today . we should tide it in for the next 45 
midfield has been bad again . cleverley and fellaini very poor . cardiff are getting in behind to much 
some way to mark your 350th appearance for manchester united !
no one quite understands why we are leading . that's the beauty of mufc ”
i think now persie should join :)
absolutely bored out my head my arsehole ! takeaway and a earlynight is on the cards ! after united whop cardiffs arse ! 👌👊
it annoys me how much money we wasted on fellaini ! 
me : mention a manchester united fan on ur tl ? 
people tweeting " wayne rooney should of been sent off ". don't be stupid ... it's " wayne rooney should have been sent off " 
keeper joe hart will return to the manchester city team for their game against plzen on wednesday , according to manager manuel pellegrini
 vs over 2.5 lands before ht at 4/5 . that's 4 of 5 singles in the bag . just need to hold on for 3/1 treble winner
we need midfielders !!! feel like i've said this about a thousand times . 
come on manchester united !
the way he kissed the badge make me hard to believe that he doesn't want to extend his contract at the club 
and they said manutd are back as title contenders when they defeated arsenal , now they're singing a new song .
half time : cardiff city 1-2 manchester united 
its the hallmark for champs even when u not playing well u win 
crazy first half , but have the lead , which is what matters . 
will have to score again in this game to take all 3 points imo

manchester united vs cardiff right now wwww
didnot watch even a minute of manchester united ' game . that good is f1 at interlagos !
evra ! needed that before half time ! 👍😃 ⚽️
midfield looking static though , fellaini and cleverly need to be more penetrative . 
fellini is utter shit ! get rid !!!! 
should be revising for pe , instead i'm on a bus back from manchester cause there was no lifts after the football match , fucking shambles
i may be a welsh boy but ive always had manchester united in my heart , a little bit of me wants cardiff to win but c'mon united !
damn , i need to get the manutd away kit .
£ 27.5 million for fellaini , what a waste of money 
would like adnan to come off at half time . not having a good game and should be protected at 18 
rooney-another level ! 
mutch made a pass i don't see fellaini making all season 
 if rooney played for any other team , or had he done that near the end of the game , red card . games are fraudulent
i had a bet on a manchester double earlier . you better not screw this up , united .
oh manchester is wonderful ( is wonderful) , oh manchester is wonderful , its full of t*ts , f*nny and united ! oh manchester is wonderful !
the central defence too loose for my liking 
ht : manchester united 2-1 cardiff city
goodluck manchester united !! hope you guys win !!!!! 
we need new players this january 
 cardiff 1-2 manchester united - patrice evra ( 45 mins ) super header and it's half time as well
i'm a few minutes behind but i love when zebra scores off a header . he was completely unmarked . 
though we're winning , am still not happy with our performance . gives away the ball easily , evra nt returning fast + januzaj flop ! 
manchester city smash six past miserable spurs
simultaneously watchin the brazilian grand prix on the tv & manutd v cardiff on the ipad . feel like i'm in an episode of mtv cribs .
who's has ever been to a manchester derby ?
rooney's still on the pitch , he's trying to get past his man who has his arm across him with force 
goal ! evra restores 's lead with header from a corner . it's 2-1 now . 
evra seems like one of those players that just enjoys playing for manchester united .
halftime watching mu vs cardiff 2-1 mufc !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

my boys making me proud 
really hoping kagawa starts in the 2nd half 
cardiff city - manchester united ! ⚽️

if we win or lose , we don't look like champions ! another poor show . moyes has got to act in january . not good enough !

pakistan's bowling attack just as fierce as manchester city's forwards
 half time now and thanks to evra at 44 minutes we pulled ahead 2-1 to to the red devils !
thoughts about 1st half ? 
most likely it would be welbeck , nani or giggsy to feature . one more goal would seal it now 
ht : cardiff city 1-2 manchester united . this game is more suited for a player like nani on the wings . 
good game rooney 1 goal 1 assist 
evra kisses the manchester united badge !
loads of manchester city fans getting off the train in leeds . interesting ...
we missed creativity from our mf , time for ando to replace fellaini 
 or ? 
ht : cardiff ( campbell ) 1 - 2 manutd ( rooney , evra ) good job !
can someone please make sense of fellaini's inclusion in the team ? heck , why is he even at manchester united ? 
rooooooony --- evraaaaaa well donnnnne 
our matches are soo intriguing .... 
patrice evra scores a goal in his 350th appearance for manchester united ! 
shit manchester united are playing didn't know that ..
i've been waiting for united to play good football week in week out for years .... i'm still waiting 
what did manchester city do to tottenham hotspurs
januzaj , cleverley & felliani need to step up their performance in the second half for us to get all the 3 points ”
i still don't what fellani adds to the team , not been impressed with him once 
both sides have taken 7 shots . have edged possession with 55% 
when evra scores , i always scream my devils out , he a true red 
wayne rooney has an exploding head ? how interesting ! 
januzaj overplaying perhaps because he was dropped against arsenal ? 
that evra goal should ensure fellaini doesn't get the half-time hook 
anyone selling 2 tickets either standing or good seating for 30 seconds to mars tonight in manchester please get in touch asap !

i'm not a fan of buying players in january but without carrick this midfield has no quality .

those who have hopes of cardiff city beating mu , calm down baby . they haven't beaten us since 1960 . 
 going into 4th place will make the teams above us nervous , the last thing they want is united breathing down their neck .
a lot of play in half almost every game 
i need a picture of evra kissing the badge , best manutd player in the first half .
still trying to work out what fellaini actually does ?

now that was a goal for cardiff to rembr by .. n then kissing the united batch jus makes the match more intersting ... 
not been januzaj's game today 
the referee basically classes kicking someone on purpose as a yellow . 
 have the worst first-half record in the league ( w0 , d8 , l3) , while have the best first-half record in their last 20 games .
iy l cardiff city 1-2 manchester united 15 ' rooney , 33 ' campbell , 45 ' evra
who are the abus blaming for rooney not getting sent off now saf has retired ? 
rooney definitely deserved to get sent off . changed the game but . wonder if cardiff will appeal for a suspension if win .
poor midfield display by 
we are missing carrick jones and van persie 
campbell former manchester united player
manchester united !!! rooney : -*
im so happy of manchester united .
still waiting for fellaini to score a header from a corner kick .. 
evras fully rated 2-1 united should bring on giggsy second half in his home town 
it would be sad to see evra leave at the end of the season if he doesn't get offered a new contract

manchester city hasn't lost since replacing joe hart
- damn sleepy but still watching game ! :)
" i honestly can't think why he's not sent him off " i can !! he's wayne fuckin rooney of manchester united ! 2 main reasons
how are doing ?
manchester united in my heart and soul . 
captain patrice evra scores in his 350th appearance for manchester united and tops it off by kissing the united crest . perfect .
i'm a fan but that should of being a red fact !
we don't need complete and total noclass trash like them at our club !!!! 
moyes hints at rooney rest . 
injury list is quit long at the moment but with our squad we never complain like other teams 
ht mufc 2-1 cardiff
rooney been our best player again . smalling good defender but is not a full back 
but nvm 2-1 i guess its enough so see ya tmr red boys 
we beat any one even if we are not in old trafford 
thank you patrice evra ... i need now a januzaj goal or assist and hernendez " c " special 
that was not a red card !!! would the commentators get over it and stop bringing it up every 5minutes !! 
thats why we best team in london ! glory glory patrice evans ! 
manchester united bitches !!!
its been a very poor half and we going to have to sort ourselves out defensively . 
first half : cardiff city 1-2 manchester united ( campbell | rooney , evra )
mt cardiff city 1-2 manchester united
ok . ht . cp 1-2 mufc . wazza & evra were save united at the first half .
rooney should not be on the pitch ! cardiff have been decent and don't deserve to be behind . united's midfield average at best . 
fellani is the closest i have seen to an iceberg he is immobile 
whyyyy am i not seeing 30stm in manchester tonight
ht cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united
get over it lads . should of been a red . it wasn't . bang . 
graeme souness just shut it 
hernadez pass to rooney was class !!! 
give paul scholes a ring again please . we need a creative midfielder seen a fellani and cleverley are shit and kagawa won't play 
on route to manchester ! 😄
can someone tell me what fellaini brings to man u 
average 1st half 
cleverley loves a sideways pass . bring on giggs 
ht 1 - 2 need united to win 3 -1 for £250 c'mon united !
woohoo !!! 2 - 1 cardiff at ht . keep the lead , lads !
souness " rooney has an exploding head , we know that ." thats fucking deadly he should do that for his celebration when he scores ! 
loved the way evra kisses the badge everytime 
ht : cardiff city ( 1 ) v ( 2)manchester united . 
fellaini still looks like he doesn't know how to play with this team 
am i the only person who believes that fellani will come good 
- half time - cardiff city ( ' campbel ) 1 vs 2 manchester united ( rooney , evra ) ... glory ... manchester united
manchester is red !
lets go manchester united 👏⚽️
looking over that rooney challenge , i have no clue how he's still on d field . __ . 
fellaini/cleverley combination showing zero creativity . laboured , too many sideways/safe passes . 
a goal on his 350th appearance .. well done evra .. true leader 
 i just hope we can defend the lead . another goal will surely be a respite .
time for to seize the initiative against cardiff .
fellaini , no more attempted scholesesque passes please . it's just heartbreaking to watch 
i'm a fan through and through , but that was a red card all day long for . 
ht : cardiff city 1-2 manchester united .
rooney + evra =2goals☺ first half 
 paid £27m for a midfielder and what we see is a big hair ☹
 team – confirmed : de gea ; smalling , ferdinand , evans , evra ; fellaini , cleverley ; valencia , rooney , januzaj ; hernandez ."
half time : cardif city 1-2 manchester united 
not sent off because he's wayne rooney ?.. 
a tangle of legs isn't a sending off graeme souness . 
where's good to go on a sunday night in manchester ? 
eeeeehhhnnn !!!' 6-0 !!!! manchester city f*cked up tottenham boyy !!!!
that's a sensational assist from hernandez 
haha the greater manchester police were talking pictures of the school outside of my house and now my house is on their twitter 
patrice evra heads takes manchester united a 2-1 lead against cardiff .
we have to play better 
i love manchester :)
ht manchester united 2 - 1 cardiff city 
at least i get to watch the second half of the manchester united game
lets change your nickname to -> . lets support manutd ! :)
glory glory manchester united ..!!!
glory glory manchester united !
rooney deserves all the money he is asking for , three wazzaz on the pitch . and also compensating for those awful midfielders . 
wes brown red , wayne rooney yellow ? 
didn't see it live , but i agree rooney should have seen red . stupid . thought sir alex made him grow up years ago . 
man united won't impress me today , but one thing is certain , will win .
yes rooney should of been sent off and wasn't . but last season nani was sent off vs madrid & shouldn't of been . 
 winter sale : fellaini ( 80%) chicharito ( half price ) smalling/anderson ( buy 1get1free ) young ( ono ) steve round ( call for best price) !!!
all three points just return home to old trafford . all this initial gra-gra must be quashed . 
calm down cardiff ! ref missed four calls for leading up to the kick-out . rooney was impeded and stepped on . karma . 
heck even fletcher can do better than fellaini . 
come on red devils 
dear david moyes , please give rooney a rest for the champions league fixture . 
ht | cardiff city ( campbell 33 ' ) 1 - 2 ( rooney 15 ', evra 45 ' ) manchester united 
is it half time yet guys ?! 
david moyes needs to talk to januzaj , seriously . he needs to understand that the epl is a serious business n he must be serious ! 
 foreverr
half-time : cardiff 1 - 2 
i want out during 2nd half 
score - concede - score ... 2-1 , we're leading again 
pundits can be shit . rooney was clearly booked because the ref thought he pulled the player back . if he sees the kick , he goes . 
patrice evra scores on his 350th appearance for utd . 
at least manutd leading 
tell me again why we need baines when we've got evra ? 
manchester united are like donuts at the moment . there's a hole in the centre
like any self-respecting human , i've got no time for rooney . but if he's helping send abus into meltdown then he's on a righteous path 
manchester united : *
 winning thanks to a wayne rooney goal despite the fact he should have been sent off . strange , cause you never see united get decisions
we can win !!!!! 
lots of mickeys on here outraged at patrice evra's goal celebration . turn it in you soft twats . 
update on the drunk : he woke up , realised he needed to get back to manchester , went back to sleep , missed his stop again ! 
rooney should have gone but i suppose the usual bollocks will be trotted out about mu always getting decisions 
 utd still got the refs in their pocket 
cardiff city 1-2 manchester united at half time . we haven't been convincing thus far ... we're fortunate to be ahead at the break . 
hey ! where is anderson ? he is still potentially better than any midfielder we have . 
come on united , strike it out ! 20ns
carrick’s absence obvious so far . i’d seriously consider bringing giggs on in the 2nd half . lacking any sort of awareness & composure 
the red devils . manchester united .
ggmu hope mufc wins today game 
trust me and holly to get on the wrong tram in manchester loool
rooneeeey 1 goal 1 assist ., manchester united
kagawa kagawa !! on for cleverly . put fellaini just infront of def holding . 4-1-3-2 plzzz 
ruststand : cardiff city - manchester united 1-2 . [ rooney ' evra ]
1 goal and 1 assist , rooney is already a mom candidate . 
we need to work on our midfield common manchester united
we know that the rules say that rooney should have been sent off . he's extremely lucky . i think it's very petty though . 
we lack depth in midfield . 
medel a childhood manutd fan .. i can see that ! done us 2 favours today for the goals . 👏
epl : ht : cardiff city 1-2 manchester united .
just saw replay of rooney's booking . the only reason for a red would be reputation . seen way worse not even get a yellow . 
rooney has been unreal so far , he's been running channels back and forth . great work ethic . 
poor display , rooney should've seen red , how are united ahead is beyond me . 
arsenal fans are no longer hating on liverpool and chelsea again . they are boy hating on a team they wrote off . 20ns

i think fellaini was bit better than cleverly in the first half 
tottenham manager andre villas-boas says his side need to be " ashamed " after losing 6-0 at manchester city .
when you look back at the rooney incident , its not that bad , it looks worse than it is , all he actually does is trip up his opponent . 
joe hart will start for manchester city in the champions league on wednesday , says boss manuel pellegrini .
100% a red card . 
 bazing come on we need the #3points

wee man evra 
poor display , rooney should've seen red , how united are ahead is beyond me . 
glory glory manchester united <3

nice half time result in such a tense environment for the lads , will welcome nani in 4 smalling come 2nd half , so valencia moves to rb 
theophile is such an unfortunate surname . he sounds like a type of paedophile that only takes interest in guys named theo 
halftime 2-1 
 is a red through and through so we got to love him much , he's a loyalist he has so much passion for . love u paddy ....
cardiff city vs manchester united 1-2 
manchester united forever ! 
i guess some players are * too big * to be sent off go mighty we'll get something from this 
manchester city look like a completely different side at home ! 
so it seems that are lucky to still have rooney on the pitch and then he goes and scores
that assist by hernandez for rooney's goal was sweet . 
one mistake and jonny evans is the worst united player to have lived . some united fans clearly haven't watched our last two seasons . 
with great power comes great opportunity 
really would like to watch webber in his last 1 race , but playing and vettel will run away with it as per . 
ht : cardiff 1-2 united 
+22 - manchester city have a +22 goal difference - only arsenal & liverpool ( 24 ) have even scored that many ! 
look at the score , we 2-1 up that's all that count 
it's amazing how evra is such an aerial threat . what is he 5'8? phew 
glory glory manchester united ( y )
 moyes don't care how they play as long as they win !!
my team doing work like always ! 
carrick sorely missed here . chaotic in midfield . 
i hope we r not too far off the pace when our back 4 finally settles . 
united need a calming influence like giggsy out there for the second half . cleverley's running around like a headless chicken 
wahey ! 2-1 at half time ⚽️ 
ht cardif 1 - 2 manchester united .. ggmu
has anyone mentioned rooney shouldn't of been on the pitch to score his goal yet ? 
 , very well done to rooney
carrick is the difference in the midfield , he's absolutely class
patrice evra scores on his 350th appearance for manchester utd .. and kissed the badge "
- a much better 2nd half is required from .
glad we are in front , rooney needs to keep his cool he got lucky ! players need to up there game , c'mon united !!! 
manchester united 2-1 cardiff city , i'm enjoyin de game
once upon time the other manchester side come off the second-best by the bluebirds . could it recur to other side ? hope it was dejavu .
man utd next match : 28 november 3:45 am bayer 04 leverkusen vs manchester united
i'm scared for the second half !!!! 
considering are missing 5 first team players , any win today would be a great result . going to have to work very hard for it though .
grame souness absloute clown 
front two pressing , centre halves in retreat , space everywhere when we don't have the ball . makes the midfield pair look idiots . 
 had practically the entire squad at their disposal and they throw it all away with that absolutely dire tvc script .
we look vulnerable without carrick . shows how much we need to sign a quality cm . 
tottenham got scrubbed today by manchester city lmfaoooo
love , honestly don't know why people don't like him .

fellaini is shit . big daft donkey 
c'mon da red devils , not the best team we have fielded but let's get da win 
fellaini clearly has the ability but for some reason has shown nothing since his move . 
can tell souness is a scouser 
wish i hadn't woken up to watch the persona event , it wasn't that exciting . made me miss manchester city's thrashing of tottenham
that deadly pass that was played through for cambell is what we need in our cm 
so bad in the middle of the park today , carrick is sorely missed ! hopefully scrape a win here 
it has been reported 11 foreigners raped 11 cockney's in manchester this after noon !

can't really complaint .. some of our quality players are injured ... so far so good 
latia patrice atleast ending the 1st half 
it's official . english pundits are completely delusional when it comes to manchester united . 
rooney was lucky he didn't sent off after that tackle . 
ht : cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united 
call me biased but i don't think that was a red card . yellow , yes . 
manutd games are always exciting
campbell's run off evans deserved a goal . up until that point , rio did a great job to keep him quiet .

just saw rooneys yellow card ... definitely should of been red ... lucky boy !!

i'd say the main disappointment is that fellaini hasn't had any impact on the game so far . he really needs to step it up . 
who needs leighton baines when you've got a left back who can head like that !

we knew it wasn't going to be easy and cardiff are playing and passing well . our passing needs improvement . so glad paddy scored . 
ht : 2-1 
 half time : cardiff 1-2 man utd . rooney , evra 
wayne rooney's name in everyone's mouths for both the right & wrong reasons in the first half : one goal , one assist , one blatant foul . 
nice move evra and a good header 
i told you guys to have patience , cus the 3 points is ours . 
not often evra scores 
manchester city trashed tottenham hotspur 6-0 ?!?! insane much
just 2 more goals in the 2nd half 
1st half goal by 15 ' rooney , 45 ' evra 
ht | cardiff city 1- 2 manchester united ( 33 ' f . campbell , 15 ' rooney , 45 ' evra ) 
manchester united . ❤️😍
past is the past , the team need to built up from this one ... doing it against another manchester cunt is away to prove it .. 
love it when evra scores ! c'mon united ! 
damn___beat mufc for me plzz
carrick - people don't see how important he is until he's gone 
just got on the wrong train , currently on the way to manchester 
lets go manutd . climb that table ....
3 points today . surely . we must win ! 
would be good if cardiff beat both manchester clubs
evra do like rvp , well challenges accepted 
" manchester united somehow lead by 2 goals to 1 " what do you mean " somehow "? we put the ball in the net twice . not rocket science .
some crazy characters knocking about in manchester , crazy
kwakwakwakwakwakwakwakwa !! one of the analysts says " manchester united somehow lead by two goals to one "...... sums it up for me . i'm sleep !
by far the better team . we will turn it around and get a home manchester double
great to see sir alex ferguson as always 
a state of emergency should be declared on that midfield . very poor . 
what a touch from , wonderful . 
fifa 14 is so real that you lose most of your games playing with manchester united
 2 cardiff 1 .... its half time
 and both hate united always negative towards us why have them on skysports pisses me off 
brilliant weekend in manchester but bed and a jen changs is deffo on the agenda tonight 
wonder how many people saying rooney should have been sent off for today thought he shouldn't have been sent off for eng v montenegro ?
ht : cardiff city 1 manchester united 2 . keep hunting goals , lads .
i am a malaysian's manchester united supporter .
does rooney deserve a red ? hmmm , let's ask graham souness ! muchness . 
jesus , all can show is 's trip . ridiculous , there were three goals that half , you knobs ! 
while cursing the spuds defending , i forgot how lame ours is too . but no worries evans & smalling are there for reality check . pissed . 
watchin manchester united game 😌👌
hope we can keep the ball better in the 2nd half , cleverly & fellaini need to work harder as a pair ! 
we did before , we'll do it again 
latest : cardiff 1-2 manchester united
okay , maybe you could say manutd aren't " cheating " themselves but all this preferential treatment gets me so fucking angry .
come united , we need a win here ! 
not a criticism , but rooney has abolished the saying " a player is never as big as the club ".. he is bigger than i dnt care wat any1 says
👍👍 pleased with this so far ! 
... and then pee , shit and fart on their dead bodies !!! 
up to rooney to save my sporting evening now 
all 6 goals scored for manchester city today were by former la liga players . you're welcome epl .
need to score another goal fast and not to lose ball so easy and we will win this 
fellaini , it's not like we're asking you to do actual magic . just be a bit more creative every now and then ... and run a bit faster . 
fellaini has been awful again and cleverley doesn't suit a 4 man midfield . 
never be afraid to try , remember ... amateurs built the ark professionals built the titanic . 
manchester united 2-cadiff city 1
half time ..... 1-2 goals by : 15 ' wayne rooney 33 ' campbell 44 ' patrice evra
the manchester city fans haven't been this happy since they were chelsea fans . 
fellaini just does not deserve to be in a manchester united team , he cannot pass a ball
rooney should of been sent off obviously but the way the pundits go on about it just shows how much are hated 
so campbell is a manchester player , our future is in good hands . campbell , januzaj , lingard , smalling , jones , powell among the bigshots
the pirates play manchester at home on december 7 .... 
half time : manchester united 2-1 cardiff city
living in a house where all of them are gooners but me ( mufc ) n my kid bro ( cfc ); the criticism have been heart burning aswear .
half-time : cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united ..
let's go manchester united
awesome ! campbell academy graduate scored 3 against manchester so far ... 
good dat manutd scored d 2nd goal & eased my cousin's(manu fan ) mind & reduce his shouts at dz viewing center 
manchester city destroyed tottenham 6-0 lmao
i don't see a future for chicharito beyond this january . loses the ball too many times . 
we are playing at the manchester christmas markets again tonight , 5pm-8pm in st ann's square !
januzaj had an awful half , i don't think he completed a dribble or a skill . 
nasri delighted with " great result " at home : midfielder samir nasri believes manchester city are proving what they are capable of at ...
live on astro supersport mufc vs cardiff .
1.3 for another goal in cardiff is another value bet , won a few today so feeling this ! 
manchester city batte tottenham 6-0 forza city
just seen the rooney incident . at first i thought it was only yellow but thenough i seen the little kick . definite red card 
roll on this second half ! 
you observe a lot of things when you watch the match without any distraction . 
so around the cardiff stadium they are advertising the university of south wales , a uni for welsh folk , that can't be right ! 
i want fellaini to score 
go 
fuck the manchester game . space jams on .
gunna just lay on the sofa and watch the game ⚽️ 
ht : 1 - 2 cardif city - manchester united
win or lose , haters gonna hate . 
 why is rooney still playing , after that horror tackle . 
manchester united all the way man . ( y )
manchester city won 6-0 today .. woah
patrice evra scores on his 350th appearance for manchester utd .. and kissed the badge 
i'm guessing frazier campbell must've not liked his time in manchester must've probably had a bad experience with stuart hall
never got to manchester today so we are getting chinese for dinner
how rooney is still on the park is beyond me ! 
rooney is manchester united .... cardiff best bring it the next 45 !!!
niggas b hating on rooney ... get on with ur lives yo !!.. 2-1 
just seen the result from etihad , manchester city throwing down a statement !! and united , cardiff seems a corker ! rooney a naughty boy ??
i'm sure the qe2 could turn quicker than fellaini 
funny that bluebirds are wearing a red kit and red devils are wearing a blue kit ... 
cardiff v manchester united 
just saw rooney's tackle ... should of been a red 
sky what are you doing hoddle and souness the knob head duo
some very hot guys in manchester !
smalling is actually a good defender , i didn't used to like him . he can be a long term man . 
now stop flapping for cardiff c u lot , they playn wel but mufc on top of it !! ⚽evrionesuddnlysupportcardiffcity/ha !! 💪😜mufc🏃🇬🇧🍺
you can ask " should rooney still be on the field ?" but at the sand time you can ask " should cardiff even be in the english league ?" 
its okay to compare tottenham with manchester united when manchester city is involved
we need more goals .... come on !! 
we need more control in the middle 
when we get our key injuries back ill be more confident going away from home . i can see us conceding this half which is worrying 
sensible decision from the ref to give a yellow card no suprise the studio ' experts ' disagree refs can't win can they ??!
evra so much love and passion for this club , kissing the badge again , gotta love his attitude and love 
cardiff city 1 - 2 * manchester united ( patrice evra 45 ' )
these arsenal fans no longer hate on chelsea and liverpool again . they are now hating on a team they wrote off . 20ns
cardif vs manchester united . 2-1
manchester is red !!!
manchester united you guys are playing like crap , you guys need to pick it up in the 2nd half !
plays the 350th , scores the goal and kisses the badge .. thats the legend evra a true united blood
cap evra scores on his 350th appearance . and kisses the united badge to celebrate . 
 and proving that we definately need a new central midfielder . we have barely had the ball with those two clowns . 
good things take a long time , roo . and now is you . ♥ 
swift change into long johns in manchester station as my jeans have decided to rip just below my arse :/
1-2 after first half ! great game so far ! :) 
1st half sloppy passing sitting back and solid defence get in box

avb suffered his worst ever defeat as a manager in the hands of manchester city .

red card all day long , virtually identical to his red card against montenegro . 
now its time for vs cardiff
who cares about when are playing ?
patrice evra has scored 7 pl goals for , 5 of them headers .
jonny evans was busy in the first half . 8 clearances for the northern irish defender . 
manchester united are the most boring out of the top teams in the pl .
3 weeks today till i come manchester👍
 all three points . we can do this syk up !
cardiff will be kicking themselves if they lose this game . and if they don't , then rooney will do it for them 
united still getting usual ref treatment without fergie , red card for any other team/player #12men
this ref does know that he is not in manchester . he does not have to let everything go manure's way ..
* loses 10 followers because i hate manchester united . *
manchester united don't play around in the 2nd half
loving januzaj's wrong work . 
the thing is , manchester city were only okay today .
always said was the highest jumper & he proves that every season , g . 
common mufc lets do this ... more goals
that ironic moment when the shortest man on pitch scores a header !! 
ok . so the referee is a prick . let's just take the three points and get out of that shit hole back to england . 
campbell dint celebrate !!! v 
 1-2 
we are missing many 1st xi starters but we are leading but u are still not happy ..... fans . fuck off 
united day 
manchester united day ☺
ht : cardiff city 1-2 manchester united 
januzaj is playing like santiago munez ( i hope everyone has seen goal) . 
what the fuck was rooney playing at in fairness .. haven't seen him act like that in years 
ht : cardiff 1 - 2 ( campbell ; rooney , evra )
i want giggs on 2nd half , if only to keep possession 
manchester , you have been a delight as ever . the journey home as painful as ever .

why is everyone going in about should rooney be on or not there's been worse challenges than that and nothing done about it 
and now for manutd to win and wrap up a great sunday !
lol ! manchester united haturs everywhere ......
fellaini has been pretty good today ... refs aren't letting him play at all though ... hope it doesn't affect his game .. 
we be asking for more of the same in the 2nd half 
live ht cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united
who gives a fuck if rooney should've got a red ! i'm glad he didn't! you'd all moan if he got sent off ! so stop moaning cos he didn't!

glory glory manchester united > =)
everyone sure to quickly say we won this game(if we do ) because of the ref after that rooney yellow . 
what a game ! i hope emerges victorious tonight .
we don't care what the haters said ... we are manchester united !!.
didnt know i have a friend who plays for manchester united . hahahaha . awwwww .
 manchester united vs cardiff city ..
hate the commentator but he got one thing right . even when we are not playing well , we win games . thts the difference ! 
watching fellaini today , i can understand why we never went for barkley . midfielders who can run , pass and create are so overrated 
slipping like him and not passing the ball . the ball is faster than you . 
went to , delhi to watch play only to find out that it's closed . went to den to find out dem playing 
despite moyes trailing baines still evra gives all for united . top lad he is with a big heart . 
this is evra .. 350 match with manchester united ..
this season we are stronger this season we are meaner this season we are better this season we are manchester this season we are united
one day i'm going to let it round manchester with a shippo mask on
well in evra fuck going down like city !! 
just got home from manchester nothing comes close to how good it was chilling feet up with my family ❤️

hate leaving manchester 😭😭
for those watching the match this afternoon : glenn hoddle's hair . discuss #80'sthrowback 
manchester united
it's a very manchester united performance , actually : winning 2-1 even though they've not been brilliant
half time score : cardiff city 1-2 manchester united ( rooney and evra ) 
the rooney incident was similar to cantana v shaw in 95 , two different endings but both seem to have enraged the abu nation equally 
- i do love how so many haters hate manchester united . i guess that's the price of being the best !! 
i'd say the knock on chicha not being able to assist is being addressed in this match . 
useless fellaini is a waste of money , can have him back , 
manchester city 6 ( six ) tottenham hotspur 0
cleverley isn't doing shit out there running around like a headless chicken 
the refs and af's undoubted genius long disguising how shit manutd are .
come on united !

half thoughts on manchester united - cardiff city ? 
damn manchester city spreaded tottenham's a**cheeks . 
half time bpl : cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united ( 33'chambell ) - ( 15'rooney)(45'evra )

manchester markets was actually proper good
we have become an absolute pain to watch ... that is all ... 
red devils ! 
patrice evra scores on his 350th appearance for manchester utd .. and kissed the badge 
a fan just tweeted " cleverly is running around the pitch like an headless chicken ". i say he's so blind

need to sleep .. today driving long range .. super tired .. gd luck ..!!
love seeing evra kiss the badge because you know that he loves manchester united with a passion and wears his heart on his sleeve .

manchester united ✌
evra makes 350th appearance . scores and kisses the badge . it doesn't get any better than that . true red !!! 
selamat malam dunia . in we believe
you can ask " should rooney still be on the field ?" at the same time you could ask " should cardiff even be in the english top flight ?" 
will the second half continue to be as heated as the 1st ? we'd love to hear your score predictions and thoughts 
manchester united manchester united manchester united manchester united manchester united manchester united manchester united
now back home cheering to a victory against 
ht : cardiff 1 - 2 united 
what could have been of us had we sold rooney ? thank god moyes saw a different perspective to what saf told us and called it right . 
loving the hate for rooney 😂😂😂 
go manchester united
evans is giving januzaj too much of a bollocking this game . the boy is now deflated . 
patrice evra makes his 350 appearance for manchester united . congratulations .
everyone blaming evans for that goal we conceded but what was our midfield doing ? one simple pass just took them out 
we need a world class central midfielder .. just goes to show how much wev relied on carrick over the seasons .. cleverley has been shit 
manchester city finally getting a standout win 
* badge kissing ! i love this club ! manchester united
the cleverly/fellaine partnership is shit . cant string a pass and terrible defending . need giggs on . 
 arsenal fc is playing good but watch out for the two manchester clubs ....
okay manutd will win ...... k
watchin cardiff vs manchester ! go manchester unitedd !!
forever manchester united . 
mr moyes has his work cut out at half time sorting this performance out 4moyesboys 
sun 24th nov 17:00 : the in is currently partly cloudy and 7c | max : 6c min : -1c
nervy first half .. even with a goal up , this game is far from over . need to work harder . cleverley and fellaini need to step up 
evans is our most consistent , most brilliant and a solid defender ( second only to vidic in that regard) . undoubtedly the best cb at mufc .
why the fuck am i not in manchester
common mufc .. get a grip and hold this game ...
getting killed in the middle of the park . get the ball out wide try and carve out a third looks the best hope . 
this normally happens after international week , teams with loads of international players struggle against lesser teams due to fatigue 
get in paddy lad 
haters gonna hate but united army gonna keep reds flag flying high ""
manchester united gonna win tonight !
it was a red card ; great game from us until now so we have to collect this 3 points and close the gap with arsenal !! 
rooney and some few players are temperamental . that's 90 percent temper and 10 percent mental .... 
ht : cardiff 1 : 2 manchester united
thanks for the half time update guys .: ) !
back in front . salute captain . our midfield is crap though . 
someone update me on 2nd half of game . 2yr old nephew has taken charge and nick jr peppa is on
 is no4 in manchester trends , hm
 defenders need to handle campbell or else ....
 patrice evra , captain , 350th apps for man utd , scored .
i support chelsea & any other team playing against manchester united . . i mean it . .
what ? manchester united 2 and cardiff city 1 ? hahahhaa 
don't go to manchester until thursday yet i've already packed my bag , i must be excited
 evra you rock
we really needs to improve in the 2nd half 
enjoying the at half time in the united match , yes . 
play 4-3-2-1 fellaini , cleverley and giggs on for hernandez . rf adnan lf nani on for av25 and uptop rooney 
and fellaini playing at cm or dm is equal to playing with 10 players ... 
i have no issue with scoring ; the issue is with defending . i don't trust out defence or midfield . too weak
halftime : cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united . 
( wazza taking a corner)last tym it was rvp , but he's not der 2day .... bang !!!!! evra heads it in !!!! 
heading back to reality , rather stay in manchester 😑
tea , pack for manchester , then get into bed and watch christmas movies tonight sounds decent to me ☺️

chicarito not visible in the match , that's his style of playing . he often plays like that and ends up with a goal . 
evraaaaaaaa . the captain uses his head when we needed it the most . what a lad . a red in the truest sense of the word . 
great weekend in manchester . great place to be too . blog post to come
without carrick , no leading figure in midfield . and fellaini still confused playing with the champions 
wayne rooney is the best manchester united player . and he will be the best until he is a red . roooney ! roooney ! roooney ! roooney ! 
second half time 
ht : 2-1 
manchester united fortunate to be 2-1 up . seriously . rooney should have been sent off .
love him or hate him , we the people of manchester united love him , rooney groove mode , his the best .

feel that there will be a lot of talk about ref decisions tonight , at the moment mufc are reaping the benefits , but need to sharpen up .
giggs on the bench for in cardiff . he hasn't scored in wales since he went round his brothers house and fucked his sister in law .
midfielders who lumber around aimlessly and hardly win physical battles in midfield despite being 6ft 4 are definitely the way forward 
manchester united !
evra scores on his 350th appearance for united . keep going lads , overcome this hostile crowd and win 
cardiff vs manchester united may be the most interesting match in football history . 😱
i loved it when kissed the badge .

if you still refer to united as " mu ( m-you) ", you might as well quit your day job as well . 
great scenes -- rooney saying a lot of things to young januzaj -- the belgian/englishman/etc . nodding away ... 
not really happened for januzaj yet today . hopefully he'll be encouraged to keep trying things , and not slaughtered when they don't work

oh , and : dumbass of the year award : there'll be interviews in portsmouth and london later so i knacked up by going to manchester
both cleavery and fellaini must hold on better , both cannot dictate play 
i told myself i won't leave my bed until the manchester united game is over ☺️
ferdinand remains class positionally and with the ball but his relative lack of pace these days negates the team's ability to press . 
 is on again for the 2nd half .. common boys we can do this

wrap up this game boiz * mufc *
 all win games . await win . what a weekend of victories 
chilling in manchester for the evening drinking cheap booze 
a bit sloppy , not the best performance but so far so good . rooney man of the show again with one goal one assist & one yellow card . 
no mention of the clear fouling of fellaini then sky ? 
something terribly wrong in cm area for . evans and rio hv to step into midfield to build the play . but still happy wth 2-1 lead 
 we'll never fall !!!!

the more i watch fellaini .. the more i think how bad his bonce is ! 
we have to grind this result ... 
someone please shoot the glazers and the board , esepcially wodward and fergie , dead right now !!! 
manchester united are entering the race for schalke 04 midfielder julian draxler .
this microphone head should score his first goal na ! argggghhh 
what is the ruling on hugging a player so he can't jump ? is it the same as pulling his shirt so he can't jump ? 
ok next :d nw manchester united again 
wayne rooney just can't be allowed to leave manutd for anything in the world ! 
united start the 2nd half brightly . januzaj has an effort blocked , winning utd a corner , which fellaini heads wide

i just can't wait to sing in manchester ! :-))))))
rooney man lower ur energy ok play safe we dnt wanna lose u half way 
can anyone please tell me what the manchester city vs tottenham score was
pleased with what i've seen from cheech so far . good energy , pace . if rooney had passed back to him , he'd have scored our 1st . 
without carrick , no leading figure in midfield . and fellaini still confused playing with the champions 
i'd love to know what martin tyler thinks of the wayne rooney yellow card . 
 stay watching !! manchester united
cardiff 1 - 2 united 
half time come on 
i'd like to see hernandez score :) 
ferdinand is just senile , breaths a sec less than humans . 
i can't be the only one that thinks januzaj isn't that good . and while we're on the subject has fellaini ever had a good game for manutd ?
3 points . don't care how we get ' em . 
touched down in manchester , weeknd here we come 💕
i feel so ill , i don't want to go back to manchester
i really don't know what the big deal is with manchester united . they play really boring , 1 dimensional football with no skill or flair .
the team you " love 2 hate " is playing right now all over your tv . we don't die , we multiply ! 
£27million for fellaini though ! he makes djemba-djemba look like edgar davids ! 
 rooney's hat-trick , hernandez brace , 3 assists from januzaj . don't change that dial . 
 : manchester united have now gone nine premier league away games without a clean sheet . 
cardiff city in red and manchester united in blue . makes sense .
i think it's best to say that tom cleverly is the worst midfielder to ever play for 
second half : cardiff city 1 manchester united 1

i want to support fellaini but he isn't helping his cause .. 
marouane fellaini is slowly ( but surely ) convincing me that its the worst £27 million have spent in a long while . 
 
awwwww feargeson !!!! 
glory -glory - glory manchester united > =) * beer *
so we have chicharito that's good enough to start for manchester united , but not to get called up to the national team hmmmm
come on united ! 
united are the manchester team . goals are great city but you cannot play away .
pakistan win , india lose , manchester city win and now waiting for manchester utd to lose 
manchester united
i just packed for manchester to avoid doing coursework i suck

 looking like a g 
if you see at the manchester christmas market tomorrow say hi to us
fellaini should be substituted 
januzaj is a fantastic player , the future of 
i love hayley lamkin and manchester united
if we toss in manchester shows , that would be 10 shows in the uk alone . i need to check my life right the fuck now .
shut up about the rooney incident ! it happened . there's no changing it . he's on the pitch . 
very much looking forward to a night out with my lucylou ! 
since wayne rooney has scored first within 20 minutes , we're doubling his odds from 7/2 to 7/1 . 
manchester united are a really boring team to watch . no wonder they always get obliviated by the big european teams
chicharito offers nothing defensively . no tracking no challenges nothing . on the fringes every game ; except when he scores . 
if united hold on and win the top five is normal service be resumed in england
someone's just bought a german sausage and put english mustard on it ! crazy here at manchester markets
come on devils we want more 
not a red card rooney's foul 
' the ref from the froch groves fight tried to stop this game at half-time ': manchester city 6-0 tottenham
had a great weekend in manchester the fight was best i've ever seen live . just shame about the refereeing , can't wait for the rematch !
is that psy of gangam style in a mufc jersey ?
we'll never die , we'll never die , we'll keep the red flag flying high , because man united will never die . 
apartment hunting in manchester and i have finally found the perfect place thank god its an awsome house in the perfect spot ;)
first half : fellaini completed 30 out of 36 passes . cleverley retrieved the most balls in midfield , with 6 . liking this midfield duo . 
cardiff's comeback are coming around . better watch out manchester united !!
what a game by manchester city 6-0
in moyes we trust 
would love to go to manchester for the day

fellaini's aerial ability is starting to show in our offensive and defensive play . 
manchester united against cardiff in cardiff . interesting .
why does every goalkeeper turn into superman when they play 
rooney's corners are porn 
arsenal lost 8-2 to manchester united and went on to finish 3rd that season it is only one game , we can bounce back 
should be 3-1 
fellaini doing exactly what we've lacked for a long time a big attacking presence for corners and free kicks clevz has been poor tho 
oh fellaini ! rooney though is playing well in this match 
#44 on manchester united daaammnnn

what are the odds on rooney getting sent off in this match ? 
so close for united 2 strikes 
come make a long gap tonight 
joe hart will start for manchester city in the champions league on wednesday , says boss manuel pellegrini ."
so fellaini is good for something , great presence in the box 
come on united .. 
wayne rooney has got to be the best corner kick taker in the epl . 
cant tell me coz a player has been in the league , playing at everton , it means his transition to manchester united should be easy . lol .
rooney's deliveries have been superb today 
manchester , i love you , but you need more cash machines that work ...
evra makes 350th appearance . scores and kisses the badge . it doesn't get any better than that . true red !!! 
remember when i said fellaini is absolutely worthless ? he still is . ugh . 
javier hernandez ... means everything to me , he's bigger than messi , and manchester city . he is united , and so we all sing ' hernandezzz !'
rooney has really worked on his corner-kicks 
i love manchester united
rooney may have made a mistake at the start but the guy is still giving 💯% to playing amazingly today ☺️
manchester united's youngest player is 17 .... 
 cardiff city vs manchester united . 1-2
what a save by marshall . team 
united , united , united 
seeing fellaini in this team shows how good he can be at times . to me he is out of his depth at mufc
 western malaysia vs manchester united
do u know that 90% of manutd dead ball set pieces , the target is fellaini ?? 
the ref looks like vinnie jones . 
there has been a slight improvement from felliani today which is promising 
we are looking sharp on set pieces today , courtesy of rooney . 
at last , fellaini is making use of his height 💂 
common fellaini be a man 
we obviously worked on headers this week 
cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united at cardiff city stadium in the 54 minute in the barclay's premier league 2013 come on manchester united
will fellaini ever impress me ?? 
i'm not sure that was a red card against rooney . otherwise , you end up eight-a-side . clumsy , yes . def a yellow . 2
next match on 1/12 : manchester city v . swansea city 
 cardiff are slowly recovering from our early pressure
manchester united : starting line up : de gea ; smalling , ferdinand , evans , evra ; fellaini , cleverley ; valencia , rooney , januzaj ; hernandez
manchester bound x
wl b damned i'd lose ds match . all odds for
if set pieces are the only way we can create chances tony pulis might aswell be our manager 
i don't care how fellaini plays . as long as he protects adnan for a few years till he can protect himself , that's 27mill well spent . 
this leeds keeper is shit i only conceded 3 against manchester 
that should have been another corner for .
is moyes turning manutd into the former stoke city ? cos lately it seems manutd have become so reliant on corners ( setpieces ) for goals .
manchester united are coming up
manchester wank wank wank

fellaina is such a dirty cunt ! 
47 - early threat from united as a corner falls to januzaj who shoots , but it's blocked by caulker . 1-2 
fellaini is really improving , hope he get a goal 
waiting for a hernandez goal .. 
marshall has been fantastic on goal for cardif but a third looks eminent for

i remember city was playing with cardiff city .. :)) ⭐️&rt
said it before and i'll say it again , feliani is outta his depth !!! no fear in our midfield these days for other teams 
fuck that phew !!
appalling midfield display . 
its half time winning 2 goals to 1 aqainst ... rooney with a goal and assist
 is good ... it's their consistency that is shit
last time cardiff and united matched was on march 1975 . 
what are our defenders doing ?! 
with today's goal has reached163 & is now drawn level in fifth with robbie fowler on the all-time list . 
oooooo bad defending there for a minute !!! 
glory .. glory .. man united .. glory .. glory .. man united .. glory .. glory .. man united .. as the red go marching on on !! 
sell cleverley , he just isn't good enough . 
omg !!!!!!! that was scary 
what in the world was that . bring on giggs . right now . 
cambell tearing us apart 😒 
good luck 
felani is a disgrace to mufc
phew lucky lovely effort though
stupid manchester united defence
faith restored in united but city have smashed it .. it's not over till the whistle blows 
cardiff city 1-2 man united campbell unlucky , lovely chip but he hits the woodwork on 53mins 
united , united , united ! 
this manutd vs cardff match is getting more interesting .
wayne rooney is the first player to score 50 premier league goals on a sunday . ( opta )
someone needs to take care of campbell , he's fucking dangerous . 
what a fucking effort by campbell . 
how lucky are ? 6
manchester united sounds so pretty in a british accent .
relief for 
has fellini got someone hiding in his hair . only way to explain shite attempts at heading the ball 
mini heartattack ! 
brilliant lob by campbell ! we were very lucky . heart attack woi ! 
oh god that was too close . 
a draw would be good but mufc losing would be good enough !!!
cardiff - manchester united 1-2 😂😂😂😂 ggmu ❤️😘
evans is a fucking liability today 
fellaini is looking dangerous in the air . i'd be surprised if he didn't get one today . 
fellani the lost puppy 
got lucky there 
dont get me wrong , i really really hate manchester united . most arrogant club and majority of fans can fuck off . but even so ..
tom cleverley is absolutely shite 
follow manchester united
cleverley what the fuck are you doing . 
joe hart will start for manchester city in the champions league on wednesday , says boss manuel pellegrini .
get cleverly off , one of the worst midfield players we have along with anderson

holyshit sloppy by cleverly chedyecho 
fuck you campbell you cant do that again ! 
they just hit the bar because rooney shudda bin sent off !! 
campbelllll ... almost . need one more goal to kill the game here . 
i have suspicions that evra and fellaini have been wanking one another off with them bandages 
mufc wants to bring cristiano ronaldo back with a " mega-commercial deal " in the summer of 2014 . ( daily mail )
tom wake up 
wtf is going on 
rooney must work on set pieces all day 
so dodgy 
off the bar !!

yesterday i tweeted that manchester was the coldest place on earth . i was mistaken . new york city is the coldest . 

that was so poor from the manchester united defence . so lucky not to have got goal against them .
well lucky for us it didn't go in 
manchester city just flogging club like they were in laliga
our centre midfield is so so poor ! 
the way we are defending we need a 3rd 
corner statistic manchester utd 6:0 cardiff tottenham fans : ohh god ...
finally looking dangerous on set-pieces this season . so many season rooney , giggs , nani couldn't beat first man !
wow cleverly is useless .... as it stands our midfield is awful 
that's why we have to put this game to bed asap . that shot from campbell was too close for comfort . 
our midfield is dogshit . absolutely shit . fuck off woodward if we don't sign any midfielders in january 
 need a goal
please can someone help me describe dat funny fellow ferdinand of manchester united ???? haba !

that would have been such a sick goal by campbell had that chip gone in . he nearly mugged de gea right off !! ⚽️ 
i just love manchester united . ❤️

frasier campbell is causing the utd defence loads of trouble ! 
wasn't vincent tan in ' big trouble in little china "?!

manchester united are absolutely terrible , shouldn't be winning this game
and someone said don't deserve the leaf ... 
something has to be done about this terrible midfield . jones should pray every game there 
our youngest player is the calmest on the ball ... 
waiting for another goal from manchester united . ⚽⚽⚽
another phew moment ! 
please take cleverly out . he is a liability right now ! 
manchester united
pity that i didn't watche match cardif city vs manchester united .
we are living very dangerously with this campbell person 
saved by the skin of our teeth . delightful chip that by campbell . sloppy play by clevz . 
get giggs on for cleverly . 
we r becoming more dangerous at set-pieces nw oh . 
54 ' - campbell hits the bar for cardiff with a great chipped effort . ccfc 1-2 mufc
it's not been cleverley's best game . :/ 
campbell denied by the cross bar vs 
rooney is great !!! 
what a result ! coming from manchester very happy ... such a great weekend !
think we will see giggsy on for cleverley soon 
how good have we looked from set pieces ! positive sign to see ! decent start to the second half 
rio should be on pension 
probably 's best game in an shirt . 
tom cleverly may be the worst player i've ever seen in my life . get this guy off our team 
that was fucking close ... 
and to think we gave up campbell for that slow sack of horse manure berbatov 
really need to go to manchester christmas markets🎅🎄
i never question players ... but wtf cleverly ... 
51 - yellow card for steven caulker after the slightest collision with januzaj . 1-2

will never get dragged around them xmas markets in manchester ever again in my life , like i was in the penguin march 
cardiff city 1 manchester united 2 . whittingham gets yellow card .
patrice evra givn manutd da edge ... nice move guys
the importance of buying a world-class midfielder and a defender in the january transfer window has never been higher ! 
i really want fellaini to score today . 
 
this match absolutely frustrated me hahaha 
tom cleverly you are going to lose manchester united the game single handedly . you are shit
i genuinely prefer anderson to cleverley 
tom cleverley is useless on , off and anywhere near the ball ! get the old man ryan giggs on 
very ' everton under moyes ' type performance here . one dimensional . .. no creativity . 
cleverley is so overrated i swear 
is anyone else going to the 1st of june show next year in manchester ? one direction
 manchester united vs cardiff city ♥
fellaini could score one today . 
it's a good day to be a manchester city fan :)
moyes needs to get on the blower to martinez and try and arrange a swap deal for fellaini and darron gibson 
how cleverley gets in the and england squad is beyond me !
cardiff city vs manchester united 1-2 
fraizer campbell very unlucky with his chip which comes off the bar ! would have been a de ja vu scoreline ( man city ) 
frazer campbell loves scoring against manchester clubs ... 2 against city and 1 now against utd 
56 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united ( campbell | rooney , evra )
cardiff city 1-2 manchester united 55 '
manchester city beat tottenham 6-0 - reaction from the etihad coming up 
fellani is the weakest link . definitely missing carrick today 
relying on gifts from the ref to make the top 4 . manchester united .
so how about manchester city beating totenham spurs 6-0
off the bar ! cleverly's misplaced pass falls in campbell's path , tries to loop de gea but the ball comes off the bar . 1 2 
we mufc fans have a strong heart for sure .
more or less wrestling 
fraizer campbell is having a good game . was a player formed at manchester united .
no we just need to keep the ball better , giving possession away far too cheaply 
evans ... replaced ... now ... 
glory . glory . man united . 
take him off , that boy cleverly !!! 
somebody please tell me i'm wrong , with reasons , that cleverley & evans are players . good but just not good enough ?!
our centre midfield is so so poor ! 
bursting for the toilet yet this second half has become more interesting 
watching manchester united play brings me such happiness⚽️❤️ 
get in manchester united !!
52 ' cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united
cant tell me coz a player has been in the league , playing at everton , it means his transition to manchester united should be easy . lol
wow ! what a lobbed shot by fraizer campbell . too bad that wasn't a goal . 
tom cleverley is the worst to pull on that shirt . absolutely pathetic excuse for a manchester united player
 pls rt !!!!
fraizer cantona 
when you go to manchester and think it's really hot but it's really cold and you have no jumpers !!! :(
just like the busby babes in day gone by ... 
cleverley you fuckstain ... 
 final : manchester city 6-0 tottenham
end to end stuff here need a goal stop cardiffs momentum growing 
tom cleverley has some some good hair ! pity his hair doesn't make up for the way he plays ! 
hernandez doing absolutely nothing . we're essentially playing with 10 men . less said about cleverley the better 
cleverley is obviously not turning up to this game . disappointing . 
turns out fraizer campbell only likes playing against clubs that start with ' manchester '
crappy play from manchester united . gosh .
manchester united play with their 2nd ( or 3rd ? ) kit
 . good job come on red devils
get giggs or ando on for cleverley please ! 
come on 
we're not gonna get out of our champions league group if we play like this . 
10 games unbeaten here we come ! you can't jinx class !
 🌜
ok giggs for adnan perhaps ?... 
i really want fellaini to score today . 
 that was lucky .
cleverley is not good enough for united 
fave if you support manchester united
get giggs on ffs someone control the ball in the middle 
why is campbell not at united anymore ?! and why does fellaini still look like a running microphone !? stupid afro !
cardiff vs manchester utd 1:2 :)
what campbell just did is all that is been thought outside carrington . | technique 
up manchester united !!!!
tom cleverly plays for manchester untied .
get cleverley off now before he costs us this game 
fave if you support manchester city
 wtf's going on ??? tyler not crying about decisions united don't get but i suppose it's hard tobe balanced when you're a c

some strange sights in manchester
fellaini , i trust you to be the best in manchester united ..
56 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united ( campbell | rooney , evra )
cleverley is shit ! 
cleverley what are you doing ? 
that chip by campbell : l 
 midfield is shocking , rooney keeps coming deep and we all know he hates that .. needs to step up !!.
 cardiff are playing 10 men ! get fellini off !!
the walking irony that is the manchester united player tom
this season is proving cleverley is not man utd quality ! 
i know i say this every time we play but i wish we sign a decent midfielder ! 
 need a or more quality mf's and a df
why are playing valencia over nani 
problem with cleverly is you only seem to notice him when he's done something wrong . 
we need one more , our d is too shaky 
very vulnerable at 2-1 . come on you reds , in black & blue ! 
 needs an extra cushion ... cardiff will just not go away . what is this ? 
clevz and fellaini being over run by whittingham and co , mediocre 
but i still wanna watch cardiff vs manchester united . nevermind .. just stay up till the match is over :)
manchester united ladies and gents !
what the cheese was cleverley trying to do there ? 
patrice evra will be offered a £31m four-year deal by both psg and monaco next summer . ( daily star ) 
 midfield looking pretty light weight . not linking well either the defence or attack . 
off to manchester at this time on a sunday .. 
weewww trending topic all about manchester united euy thats good
united is up 2-1 . really need the three points today . 
considering we are playing without a midfield i think we are doing amazingly well 
cleverley lol 
did tom cleverley win a competition to play with a premier league club for a year ? useless . 
manchester united suck they ain't like before 😒
i hate manchester united 😖
getting ready to see the weeknd in manchester tonight eeeek 🙌
manchester united 2 , cardiff city 1 .... i know a somebody who's happy about this ! :)
if tom cleverly goes to the world cup , am going to the world cup in brazil squad . 
uniteds midfield is exceptional today . exceptionally poor . 
can't wait for to have a clear out of certain players . too many are mediocre at best .
finally a pre the match ya now . 
great shadow defending chica ! 
manchester united ❤️
cleverley you fucking dumbass ! 
around 15 til tip here in manchester , filling up albeit slowly ... 
hate saying bye to my mum when i leave to go back to manchester :(
52 - excellent save by marshall from the free-kick . it's fellaini who flicks it on , but the scot denies him . 1-2 
manchester united <3
cleverly would not get into any top six premier league team 
wayne rooney was the only player to create more than one chance in the first half ( 3 ) with one being an assist "
hopefuly win this night , you can do it beb ! 
all our mf players except carrick are proper proper duds . evans is playing more passes forward then clev/fell 
fellani just doesnt look like a player at all . he looks lost in every game hes played for us .
i've never understood why gary neville can commentate on manchester united matches . he's a biased cunt .
when has it become a crime to play well against manchester united ? this referee is totally disgusting
the most ironic name for a certain player cleverly 
watching f1 is seriously way better than watching cardiff vs manchester united match
peter odemwingie i love you with all my heart but i need team to win this one .
manchester unite
manchester united ...
think we will see giggsy on for cleverley soon 
cleverley won't be on much longer , at this rate . i'd even take a shot at anderson at this point . well , maybe i would . 
cleverley looks more and more ordinary with every passing game 
mufc wants to bring cristiano ronaldo back with a " mega-commercial deal " in the summer of 2014 . ( daily mail )
manchester united can beat hard teams . but against easy teams they have problems
that's sloppy from cleverley . very sloppy . 
hai ne campell is givin us a hard time 
okay boys we need a third please 
please take cleverly off !! 
fellaini and cleverly too poor for cm at mufc
tom cleverly needs to come off . 
cleverly and fellaini in midfield aint happening , moyes need to change it quickly ! 
ready for a chilled night after them manchester markets
manutd shouldn't draw this game o
 haha
* lead tao_ace : and someone said don't deserve the leaf ... 
january transfer window is almost here , mufc should sign one midfielder and one center back this time
the more cardiff thinks they are wearing red , so they are manchester united , the more we shall maul them ! say what rodrick muya ?
almost a great assist from 23 there . 
the god of alex ferguson is still in support of manchester united
watching manchester united game 
we need to buy quality cm , if not in jan definitely in the summer . 
cleverley can't pass forward , can't even pass backwards 
how tom cleverley made it through manchester uniteds youth system i'll never know
please stop playing cleverly and 
rooney is our best midfielder , rafael is our best winger and evra is our top ariel threat . wtf is this mess !? 
campbell always shows up in manchester doesn't he ? 3 against this city right now .
cleverly is the type of player who will perform well for a lower level team like middlesbrough . not good enough for 
last night amazing ! boys noize , nero and jack beats ripped that place up ! the rest were good aswell tho 
campbell so unlucky ! 
man we looking like we'll concede another . get it together in the back there guys ! 
20 times 20 times man united .. 20 times 20 time i say .. 
well better from every week , well done
our midfield is just not good enough ... tc23 and fellaini just don't cut it ... 
cleverley hasnt man utd quality , has he it ? 
can we get fraizer campbell back ? 
how has cleverley made a career in football ? he's awful !!! 
my opinion may not be objective as i have despised mufc with a passion for many years , but they really are a very average team .
35% of manchester united goals in the premier league this season have come from set-pieces ( 7/20) . 
cardiff out playing manutd
whether devil like it or not ,........ manchester united ......... must make it to top4 of table today ijn . 
glory glory manchester united <3
manchester united day
commentator comparing cambell to cantona because of that little dink . get over yourself . 
dis our midfield needs divine deliverance !! 
killll the game asap ........ 
" team mufc : goaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal evra scores with an amazing header ..............! "
looks like fraizer only wants to play against the manchester clubs
manchester is really nice at christmas
with every appearance , evans shows a new impressive level of sucking ! 
now if suarez did what rooney did . 
fellaini similar to andy carroll . effect in a system that suits but not the right player for this team 
tom cleverley is fucking awful . how he makes our team week in week out is really beyond me . 
2 and 3/4 hrs to get back from manchester , ffs !!
really need another goal ! 
this game is pure papper the rapper .. sort it out 
cleverly off . take him off . don't put him on again . 
i've no idea why moyes playes cleverley or evans , they're so shit . so is jones , so is smalling . we need a stronger back line 
we playing /shit ,,,,, / 
valencia is a shadow of the player he was a couple of years ago 
fraizer campbell a real threat to us . 
one more goal 
chicharito has done absolutely nothing since his flick to rooney . 
we need a two goal cushion at a place like this 
57 ' cardiff 1-2 manchester united 
the crosses rooney is providing from set plays tonight are absolutely immense even if he is lucky to be on the pitch 
yaaay daddy's just landed😁😁😁 ✈️
this is very scrappy 
the difference between a manchester united yellow card and a cardiff yellow card is outrageous .
well , considering we’re playing without midfielders , i have to say we are doing quite ok . 
some game this is 👌⚽️👍
thinking back to that scholes magazine cover half face with cleverly , that now feels a bit presumptuous , no ? 
we have to have a nemesis each game . 
52 - marshall is called into action once again from the corner , palming away united's near post effort . 1-2 
go go go united put another one .. 
now onto cardiff city-manchester united , 1-2 . ( 56 )
united definitely need a 3rd goal 
crazy how rooney of all people was the one clearing that ball , you gotta fuckin love how he's all over the field always 
cleverly having an average game , again . 
so , manutd players want to make cardiff even more deleterious by wasting balls anyhow via unforced errors ?! 
what the fuck is cleverly doing ? that geeza's running round like a headless chuck , the one that's on the spurs emblem !!! 
everyone at manchester christmas markets and at the dickensian are making me so jealous 😩 2 weeks until lincoln christmas markets 
fellaini was never worth the £27million paid for .
cleverley has been a total disgrace this evening 
tom cleverley must think he's the luckiest man in the world getting in the manchester united team most weeks 
take off fellaini bring in ando , start knocking the ball around 
rt if you love manchester united !!
come on man utd 
cleverly having a poor game . nearly cost a goal . fantastic finish from campbell . 
giggs should be in to control the mid 
manchester city won 6-0 today in their english premier league match against tottenham .
never seen such a poor center area for mufc 
super finishing from evra to give manchester united a lead in the first half . ht score manu 2-1 car . 
35% of manchester united's goals in the premier league this season have come from set-pieces ( 7/20) . 
never seen a bunch of fans so determined to abuse one player all game i guess young isn't playing ... 
we need a 3rd goal 
hate to say this but clev ... should take him off ... for ?? fletcher :p
we are tactically poor ; yes ! we are manchester united .
giggs : “ i think the reason why gary was loved by mufc fans the most & hated by rivals was b'coz he was the fans representative on the pitch "
we have not played well at all so far . at all . we need to step it up right now or we could end up being behind in this game . 
one can see where campbell learnt his trade . pity he had to go ! 
am happy to see campbell play such good football since he's a product of 
anyone who can get to manchester - go see the grayson a perry exhibition !
clever-notfucking-ly 
heard his name ring out around the stadium as fans of manchester united celebrated winning the fa cup . 2014
how much is manchester united missing michael carrick ? the answers are happening live in cardiff .
 , super sunday and 1 on the family tv this weekend . sport filled weekend 
 needs 2 find a new in da window !! 
has delighted the board of manchester united by winning the fa cup . 2014
the when 40 year old ryan giggs is currently your best midfielder # 
cleverly is not top 6 quality , yet plays for the champions . 
can't understand rooney kicking out like that b4 , unless he's looking for xmas off ? 
pissed off a mulled wine hahah 
sir alex should have kept fraizer instead of welbeck at 
tom cleverley is nowhere near good enough for manchester united . him & fellani is a really weak midfield .
oh fuck off cleverly your so shit . player yh right .
campbell usually plays well against his former club , manutd , doesn't he ? that was some chip . :-)
not complaining about being upgraded to first class on my journey back from manchester piccadilly to euston next sunday 😊
 . we need this third goal sooner than later come on united !!!!!
gave nani a contract to bench him ? 
still getting away with it 
fellaini shouldn't be in that team . he just doesn't fit in at all . worst signing ever for them imo
moyes should drop rooney to cm and play fellaini as #10 
miss out manchester united and cardiff . support both of them !
have to keep reminding myself that's its cardiff and not that are playing in red and black . 
midfield of janzaj , cleverly , fellaini and valencia hardly inspring . 
frazer campbell . you have man united roots bro . 
come on united let's get another and kill this game off . 
tonyv proving : a hard man is good to find ! come on you reds ! 
only 4 and a half hours to get home from manchester then .
moyes needs to ring the changes now ... this midfield display is awful today ! 
 : why are we letting them come at us .. not vintage performances in any of our games under moyes .
moyes what are you waiting to bring giggs in !!! 
wooooh , wooooh ... heeeey , heeeey ... from banks of irwill , to sicily , where we will fight fight fight , for man . united fc~ 
we should get these 3 points ! focus united ! 
i would give a run out now .. bit of pace and directness .. 
wtf is wrong with this nigga mendel ? 
we haven't played well at all today . but two cardiff mistakes = two mufc goals . end of .
that chip from rooney was the truth . 
manchester united jersi no . 44 . iloveyouu : *
one more goal , please . come on ! 
tyler just creamed himself , and ' frazier ' didnt score .. imagine if he had v . poor
says it has to stop at 3 places before manchester . i fear we may be here a while .
 was so unlucky there ! 
up early watching manchester united before the sunday online grind a bit later . hope to run gooooood
are we watching football or rugby ? game getting a bit rough 
ya'll should go and watch nigeria's got talent jooor ... why torture yourself with manutd cardiff ??
the defense isn't so tight today like it always is , what's going on united 
manchester united day
can we get a third goal please ... 
59 - wayne rooney heads over the bar from seven yards . 1-2 
ago manchester united
need atleast one goal .. come on united ... 
 up up and away !
as an i really try to like but why does it look like he has a jehri curl w short hair 
yes boys let's go 
 really missing carrick - no control in midfield - no rhythm to the game bring on giggs for henandez ....
valencia and cleverly are having a stormer for cardiff at the moment ..... 
watching manchester
having to listen to a football match instead of watching it <<<<<<<
glory glory manchester united
just waiting for all the last 10 min united fans to tweet " why did we sell frazer campbell ?" #20 
bet 1 : manchester united to score fourth goal @ 11/10 . who's on ?
the commentator just compared frazier campbell's shot attempt to cantona's amazing goal against sunderland .... 
 cardiff city vs manchester united
frazier can do it against manchester but can he do it on a cold night in ... etc etc
oh wayne you should have done a little better there ! 
 
come on show your power 
you'd think johnny evans would know all about campbell ! .
manchester united result has made me happy . finally climbing the table and above man city !
and while we at it , tighten our defence 
mufc evra justin bieber #23rdkevinday iphone 6 cardiff spurs trending in msia .. what the hell are this ? - . -
what on earth would be doing without rooney ? scary to even think lol 
so the juggernaut trundles on ....... good luck with that . 
its all down to the basics stick to the ball and track it that's what is doing still sloppy and lazy passing
we will need a 3rd to win this 
good signs from the game till now : valencia's form . 
let's see if ex-mufc director dyke is honest about his edict to ban players for 3 games , even if the ref saw it . i remain sceptical
i hope mike riley has plenty free minutes ! 
frazier campbell caught david de gea in no man's land with that chip . i'm just glad the crossbar denied him the equalizer . 
i think players should focus on playing football and not influencing the referees decisions . not that they do . but it's childish . 
chicharito is really good with manchester
 , , , 
come on 
manchester united !
why are united sitting so deep ... ahh i hate this 
can anderson just turn in 2 decent training performances and dislodge cleverley from this manchester united team ? please
manchester united looking very ordinary , nothing special or dynamic about their play .
lebron james at right back for cardiff is an interesting choice . he's having an alright game though . 
* valencia with a decent cross klaxon * 
one more goal pleeaaaassse ..... 
gooo .... fiiisssh .. next shot rooney dnt worry 
 should have gotten a red but he plays for manchester united . the referee doesn't have enough balls to give him one .
referee , seriously just go and ask moyes for a manchester utd shirt ! 
valencia has been very impressive again 
glory glory manchester united .
still ain't convinced about fellaini 
come on manchester united
y'all know dat lyf aint fair ... sometyms d better team doesn't win so leave manu alone biko .... 
cleverley giving the ball away time and time again , so puzzled how he gets anyway near our squad . 
we still need a goal . 
on route to manchester .
make more goals 
give rooney half a yard , he'll score . 
manchester united♡ '

refs shocking in this game 
rooney with a goal and an assist ! 
dump valencia , nani & young in the summer and bring in di maria , reus & promote zaha & lingard . 
dare i say it ... have been the better side , despite being behind . 
seems like fraizer campbell just specialized in putting the ball past manchester goalkeepers while he was at carrington 
come on manchester united 
 all in ur hand
60 " cardiff 1-2 united . 
arsenal on top , manchester are real goal poachers and idols goes to mr b !!!!

jesus , this is like watching a hull city/tigers performance . it's the 60th minute and are time wasting on goal kicks !
man utd have found the worst midfielder in the prem tom cleverly how is he at such a big club like manchester united 
so is campbell going to get fined for cusing on live tv like rooney did ? 
liverpool and manchester 
campwell hmm a treat to my health atm ... commoooooon united 
i wonder why are allowing cardiff city to dictate this game ? these dudes are push overs for all i care ! we need to thump them badly !
united end sounds like it's booming 
 take a one goal lead and then they relax
35% of manchester united's goals in the premier league this season have come from set-pieces ( 7/20) .

what i love about manchester city is that they suck away from home .
nw // manchester united vs cardiff city
are man united the new stoke ? 
manchester certainly didn't disappoint !
 .. we still struggling .. though we are on an unbeaten run in 10games . it's still laboured victories under 
someone pls remind me why mountain fellaini isn't moving . 
does players let their wives sleep with the referees and linesmen ?
love hearing the cantona chants erupt at away games ! 
notice that the officials at are doing their best to help the players not get suspended for the game next week 
i feel it , valencia & fellaini will play for stoke city someday . 
a few more games and we might get back the fellaini that played at everton . he has to put in that little more effort . 
glory-glory manchester united :)
 i must say in recent seasons manchester united has struggled with width 
i love manchester united

on my way to manchester for thirty seconds to mars !!
arsenal fans is too busy laughing at spurs ! no one remember arsenal lost 8-2 against manchester united ! * lol🙊
believe it or not ; i am actually warming up to our dinosaur ( fellaini) , let's go 
the refereeing in this game has been awful . nothing outrageous , but every call and missed call is in uniteds favor 
united need a 3rd goal .. can see cardiff getting another 
c'mon manchester united this is our game .
besok ulangan matik , while i am sitting here , in front of the tv , watching manutd vs cardiff -_- haha great ..
no close the game lads . possesion is the key 
officials doing every thing in their power to make sure manchester united win this match 
cardiff city vs manchester united
is nani on the bench ? anyone ? 
well evans and cleverley need to make way . i would rather play with valencia at rb and giggs at cm with smalling at cb till the end . 
this game should not be hard as we are making it . 
guest what , fraizer campbell youth manutd kot haha
chicha is 1000 times better when he enters as a substitute than a starter 
welbeck on for hernandez now would be a pretty wise move . 
manchester city are by far the best premier league club . say what you want about arsenal , man u or even liverpool , city is terrifying .
also , i'm watching cardiff-manchester united right now , so at least i do get to watch some football .
fellaini is doing more than a seven job . winning headers , duels . 
@ redbox cafe , nobar cardiff vs manunited .. come on manchester united .. glory glory manunited ! 
wish ferdinand and evans would stop doing stupid long balls to no-one !! 
any chance of keeping a bit of possession in this game
united fans absolute class again today , best away fans in the country by a mile 
we should buy campbell back he can play behind van persie and rooney and really become a force plus he a sir alex student ! 
0 manchester united santiago 
 aren't playing well at all ...
change needed 
we need a 3rd goal to kill the game ! cmooon uniteddd !!! 
christmas/nye is all about manchester
did chicharito travel back to manchester in john w henry's private jet at halftime ??
oh manchester is wonder full
we are not playing good :-( 
think need to bring on to strengthen that midfield up !!
 59 ' cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united
goal ! cardiff 2-2 manutd . campbell scores !
frustrating . frustrating ! 
cardiff apparently known for its atmosphere " is it only me who can only hear the man u fans ?? 
chicharito has seen better days 
valencia off nani on , giggs on fellaini off get giggs to get us some possession 
i would take cleverley off and bring anderson on . cleverley is not united class . he's average and has been poor . 
is manchester united playing with their eyes closed or what ?
cardiff have been spectacular and rooney shouldn't even be on the pitch dity scum ! 
so far , cardiff have been robbed harder than a heist on a jewellery store by a bunch of average united tarts 
hurry up january so we can buy a defender , a winger and most importantly a midfield . cleverley and fellaini are an awful partnership 
manchester united
6-0 !! wtf 
positive signs from fellaini in this game , lack of creativity but is a big presence and makes himself available at all times 
tom cleverly having a nightmare of a game today . look fragile in midfield ! 
 great game by manchester
61 ' cardiff 1-2 
look at cambell . he is trying .. game on united .. 
come on united 
ahh man !! need to do something !
 chicarito is left out upfront fightin for scraps . nobody feedin him them balls 
fellaini is too average for a club like manutd
micheal carrick's absence is felt dearly . :'( 
patrice evra scores in his 350th appearance for manchester united !
just arrived home from manchester forts . tkmax . bought a
see they have adopted the new rules for today's game , the one where when a defender puts it out its a goal kick 
there will be a day when united control the midfield . but today is not that day !! 
the belgian broccoli isn't good enough 
all packed for manchester tomorrow 😊
 i forgot hernandez was on the pitch , wish i could say the same about cleverly .
manchester united ...!!!
proximo encuentro 27-11-13 bayer 04 leverkusen vs . manchester united

would take a midfield pairing of djemba-djemba and kleberson atm 
63 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united ( campbell | rooney , evra )
tottenham manager andre villas-boas says his side need to be " ashamed " after losing 6-0 at manchester city .
moyes ' half-time team talk must have been " don't worry bout keeping the ball , sit back for 45min and fingers crossed they won't score " 
play like this against leverkusen and well be in trouble 
killll it offf ....... plssss ..... we knoww where this is heading ...... prove me wrong 
united not doing bad ... 
away fans bang on form tonight 
i'm saying it again : we need another goal . 
fellaini , cleverly et valencia out 
really want a shopping trip next weekend somewhere , maybe leeds or manchester
prediction , cardiff will beat manchester united 100-1 ha ha .
c'mon manutd ..... go go go gooooo !! lol
this manutd side has soooo much room for improvement , a midfield of fellaini and cleverley doesnt cut it
last night was on a manchester level , absolutely brutal
very uneasy when united pass backwards without vidic or carrick in the line-up . 
we need the third goal 
don't know why but i dislike manchester united a fair bit
the referees are having an absolute howler of a game . 
so campbell can shout " fuck off , fucking prick " at the lino and not a word is said . wonder how rooney feels about that 
at least i get to watch manchester united and the panthers today
the difference between a manchester united yellow card and a cardiff yellow card is outrageous .
cardiff 0 - 1 manchester united ' 15 wazza
it's like , everyone in united forgot how to pass lately . infuriating to watch . 
well at least manchester is playing😔⚽
manchester city 6-0 tottenham hotspurs today is a good day
time for a change 
good mun 
were not exactly gonna worry many teams when we play like this and city win games 6-0 
if darren fletcher can get match by xmas we will win the treble 
94 year old giggs > cleverley . 
35% of manchester united's goals in the premier league this season have come from set-pieces ( 7/20) . ( squawka )
feel sick thinking about tomorrow . this mufc performance isnt helping either
what mufc needs in this game is either kagawa or nani
all those hating you know what ... we don't care . 
the important manchester team played earlier already 😏
come on manchester united !!!!!
anyone want to buy 2 tickets to see the weeknd tonight in manchester ? dm me
cleverley off please :/ 
we need a 3rd goal . playing very poorly 
and then looses to . arghhhhhh !!!!, make me smile 
replacement bus to manchester ... 30stm and you me at six- cannot contain excitement😆
now home to watch the last bit of united and cardiff ! 
home from work in time for the second half of the game :) 
ccfc v mufc ... neither team can string 3 passes together# average
 should make use of his subs now .. valencia nd cleverley out ; nani nd giggs in : 
been impressed with our distribution from corners today 
attendance at the cardiff city stadium is just over 28,000 . 1-2 
still another goal in this . come on united ! 
chicha got his chance to start ... any complains manutd fans ? 
good work adnan ! 
fellaini seems to pass more accurately with his head than with his feet . 
we should definitely sell off in the next transfer season , has proved to be a wastage of money ! 
the problem isn't midfield , it's chicharito not defending from the front ! if moyes takes him out , you'll all see what am talking about
 | gana 2 x 1 ante el .
come on manchester united ! if we win we are in the top four !!!!!
wayne rooney running the game for . best player for us this season by a mile
without carrick we look like shit in middle of the park 
bus driver just announced " before today i didn't know this part of manchester existed ." reassuring . we're currently dishing out directions .
tom cleverley just isn't a manchester united level player
i'm moving to manchester .
doing my head in hearing tyler say theophile's full name every time he touches it , whatever it is . 
cleverly is useless , don't think fellaini is going to fit in at united . rather see nani instead of valencia 
1st goal -rooneeeyyyyyy 
could really do with valencia picking up a booking n being suspended for tottenham game 
to think we let pogba and morrison go and we kept cleverly . talk about bad business !!! 
if darren fletcher can get match fit by xmas we will win the treble 
patrice evra scores on his 350th appearance for manchester utd .. and kissed the badge
attendance 28k . come to see united , you've only come to see united . 
theophile was bullied at school . . 
let's hope united do better or keep it to the end for the win . 
cardiff city vs manchester united . #63 | 1-2
so how is that rugby tackle not a yellow ? 
honestly hope kagawa doesn't leave man utd . sigh . 
another corner/set piece , and ' ll kill this game 
there's more action going on in this game than in the boxing match last night . 
 rooney's corner kicks are so amazing

fellaini is doing more than a decent job . winning headers , duels . 
 kick off 2nd half | cardiff city vs manchester united | cardiff stadium , cardiff
cleverly is the worst player to ever wear a united shirt ... ahead of o'shea 
lmao ! the way the mufc fans at veiwing centers insult fellani tho ... so much hatred for the niccur 
c'mon let's hold on to this lead ! 
manchester united 2
fact : apparently marouane fellaini translated into english means " nowhere near good enough " 
let's go united !! 
antonio valencia is having a terrible match . surprised he has lasted 60mins . 
ashley young is my favorite manutd player ..... just saying
 : other players have to step up their game like rooney , rvp & evra .. we still unconvincing in most of our games ..
theophile is a pedophile .. he's just all over januzaj 
fact no 2 : tom cleverly translated into flemish means " even worse than fellaini ". 

 tom cleverly once won a competition to become part of the manchester united squad
not the best game here 
arsenal score via a goalkeeper error and a setpiece : lucky . manchester uniter score via a defensive error and a setpiece : resilience
65 - peter odemwingie tries a long effort , but it flies over the bar . 1-2 
woke up to a win to put them back at the top 4 , legoooooo
 central midfield doing everything possible to prove that moyes should buy big in january . no control , pressure , or goals

two of the scummiest teams playing each other ✊ 
manchester united have postponed will keane's proposed loan move to wigan to assess the extent of his foot injury 
it takes big balls & patriotism to watch a football match with little or no flair . 
heading towards the 4th spot !

bring giggs on 
midfield is non existent 
cardiff city vs manchester united 1-2 
piss poor passing 
ngeno every mistake red card and penalty , doesn't matter where on pitch . that's how much i hate mufc .
65 " cardiff 1-2 mufc 
i do my best not to get on the back of utd players . but i genuinely can't see how cleverley is in this team over anderson 
jesus cardiff are playing rugby out there today at times 
welbeck or nani should come on for janzaj 
it'll be a laugh and your impression will be heard by the people of manchester on the radio . 
mufc subs please
well played januzaj . different role for him today but in this 2nd half he has really matched the right back in defence . 
my nan moves faster than felliani 
woooooow am lovin it the red devils all the way tnx 2 rooney n evra
carrick is greatly missed in the middle of the pack cleverly and fellaini ain't convincing together bring in kagawa and take off jaz 
does fraizer campbell usually play like this against every team he comes up against or is he just trying to punish us for selling him ? 
a very good weekend in manchester . good practice ahead of the man u away game in a couple of weeks time . 
quality weekend in manchester ! hanging now !
manchester united don't look like genuine title contenders to me this year .
heard his name ring out around the stadium as fans of manchester united celebrated winning the champions cup . 2014
has delighted the board of manchester united by winning the champions cup . 2014
still 2-1 ? 
come on , get in the game 
am i the only one who thinks valencia in mufc looks at lot like michael jackson in his 20s ?
cleverly and fellaini simply can't control a game , jones has to be first choice to partner carrick when the're fit 
twowenty time , twoenty time , manutd ... twowenty time , twoenty time i see ........
fellow faithfuls , plz , what exactly is felliani doing on this pitch ?
 for life

jz44 great defending 
one more goal please 
59 - wayne rooney heads over the bar from seven yards . 1-2 
 is running this game throughout this season by a mile 
fallaini is so garbage !! 
fellaini is basically a passenger in the midfield , consistently disappointing 
we need a third . 
craig noone or craig no one ? vs 
if fellaini was still at everton do you think he would get into the first team ? 
campbell shut it , get beat down quietly 
cardiff city 1-2 manchester united . 

my brain is really fucked cos of this match . please cleverley and fellaini who is more useless ? 
come on moyes get giggs on so at least we can have a proper player in the middle of midfield . 
oh manchester is wonderfull 
there is a cardiff city player named noone . no one of none whatever you want to call him . 
manchester is red not blue
nani for adnan & giggsy for clevs will do . 
we need 2 more goals . 
don't understand why moyes hasn't made any changes yet . januzaj hasn't been seen much 
we defos need another goal here , maybe 2 ! 
fellaini is absolutely shocking . headless chicken . and its only cardiff . 
65 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united 
bring giggs on 
it would be great if could do other useful things on a football pitch apart from scoring ! 
a bunch of 12 year olds running round manchester acting pissed when they only probably had a wicked and a smirnoff ice
i wonder at what stage will fellaini realise that the game kicked off at 4 ?? get involved you donkey ! ! 
manchester united been very fortunate today so far !

come on time to earn your money and change our midfield we need to take control of this match .. 
valencia has been poor today . bring on nani 
who's the bigger dog in manchester ? 
fellaini miles away from rio's header clearance . he cannot play that position for us . does none of the basics . 
glory glory manchester united 
 need 1 more goal here to seal the win ... 2-1 is not looking comfortable .

manchester city 6 tottenham hotspur 0 match report : sergio aguero scores twice as spurs get hit for six : the first five seconds or so ...

glory be to manchester united

two4kay .... such a sick producer aswell ... i love music from manchester the world is blind to it
manchester city were extremely impressive earlier on , fully deserved the win they got . but tbh , tottenham were so poor .

is that the right sub to make or is that a gamble ? lets see . 
mensah in you dont know ... 
it's about time janusaj went for a shower . 
 off for 
cleverly needs to go . he's not good enough for united . our central midfield has been useless today . 
patrice evra has been outstanding today . will be hard for somone to fill his spot in the future 
seems moyes heard me ask of welbeck , welbeck in chicharito out 
welbeck has deffo been on the weights ! 
that warri boy has entered 
wasn't meant to be injured didn't he pull out of the squad due to being injured , seems like up to there old tricks
glory glory manchester united
marouane fellaini is a midfield nightmare ! kagawa should be on ! 
welbeck on for januzaz !! let the magic happen !! 
why januzaj ? thought chicha would be first canditate for changing today 
wasn't januzaj day today 
good run out from januzaj , hope moyes continues to give him these opportunities 
great to see danny welbeck back on the pitch ... zup zup 
how dare you do that sub , how dare you 
we bring on welbeck god give me strength ..

of all people moyes decides to bring on the useless welbeck ....... god have mercy on us 
 unbeaten in 10 games , welbeck out the whole time . coincidence ?
following back manutd fans !! 
why welbeck what's wrong with nani !!! he is better 
hernandez never makes impact when he starts 
show us why sir alex started you in those games , danny - bring back that form 
the united midfield is terrible 
injury has really affected manutd's flow indeed
man united have the most plastic fans in the league 
the language caught on camera in this game is shocking . anyone know where i can make a complaint ?? 
ice cream !!! pls manutd pls
come on united !! 
iam so happy because im a united angel ... .. heheeee

januzaj sort et welbeck rentre pour man u ! 
buut de negredo 34 ' : manchester city 2-0 tottenham .
so my mum is trying to tell me she supports manchester united . does she even know what offside means ? 😕
worse thing has happened .. cardiff have a excuse if they lose " rooney shouldn't be on pitch " & ignore the mistake from defender . 
well i'm in manchester ...
i'm drunk , how we doing though ? 
keep the pressure on lads we need all 3pts 
there is absolutely no creativity ?? can see carrick is missing . playing muxg better than the 1st half . 
just got to get out of this with a win . no rvp or carrick so would be a huge 3 pts . not gna hold breath tho cos it's absolute shite ! 
awh i love januzaj ! 
the fresh prince of manchester is back ... god help us all
what if luis suarez had kicked out at jordan mutch ?... burnt at the steak ? put on the rack ? fed to pigs ? 
this match and we will be backkkkk at the top 5 :d united united all the wayyyyy . champ20ns !! ♥♡
who did just bring on ? 
i need a 2-2 draw for manchester united !
is it me or is tom cleverly looking and playing more and more like billy tutton ? 
tom cleverley is shite 
70 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united ( campbell | rooney , evra )
i don't understand how tom cleverley plays for both england and manchester united . what does he do ?
dnt you just wonder how manchester city lost some matches
after all we need more creativity at midfield . giggsy or kagawa should be brought on . 
love the new pressing-in-midfield tactic moyes has instilled in our team . yields goals . 
need go manchester markets now
winning ugly . winning when you're not at your best . its what champions do . 
our passing today has been woeful ! 
just arrived home from manchester forts . bought my 28yr old a fabulous leather jacket . bought drinking glasses for me !!
manchester united make their first change as danny welbeck replaces adnan januzaj .
70 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united
rooney and evra celebrate as manchester united lead 2-1 at cardiff
remind me what wonderkid is in the manchester united team again
long ball all day today without carrick 
welbeck on for januzaj .. nice one 
fighting united 
welcome back welbeck . 
very very poor 
just one more , lads , c'mon 
if someone buys me a seasonticket to go watch the manchester phoenixes i'll love you forever
watching cardiff v/s manutd match ....
need giggsy in the middle of the park ! someone to control it , none has so far ! 
lets kill it manchester united .
sub manchester united make their first change as danny welbeck replaces adnan januzaj ( 68 mins ) 
fuck sake our midfield is so shit , we're giving the ball away so fucking cheaply 
time to sell cleverly and fellaini , take that money , add £20m and buy a good midfielder . 
 smalling has been very good today . 
35% of manchester united's goals in the premier league this season have come from set-pieces ( 7/20) . 
this could be a nervy 20 minutes 
our midfield is nothing without carrick :/ 
it's like watching barcelona ... their girls under-10s 
can't wait to get back in my bed in manchester 
fellaini just not good enough . 
heard his name ring out around the stadium as fans of manchester city celebrated winning the capital one cup . 2013
add more goals guys . 
great ! welbeck is on the field .......... 
getting really tight at the top of the league now . manchester clubs getting close . imperative we win the next three
manchester united are playing some boring football 💤
has delighted the board of manchester city by winning the capital one cup . 2013
someone give me a ticket for 30stm and ymas tonight and take me to manchester thnx
anyone want a free 30 seconds to mars standing ticket for tonight st the manchester arena ? bit late but just got given it
fellaini says he ' prefers playing deeper in midfield ' yet looks completely out of his depth in there , chasing shadows . 
i will seriously never ever ever understand how danny welbeck plays for manchester united , how is he even a pro footballer
it's nights and games like these that the league is decided upon . need to be strong and get the 3 points 
our cm duo today - one word - terrible ! 
this is turning into a very fergie era , type performance . quite comforting really . 
 .. i jz lve d devastating rooney ...
just look at the players on the bench . so fucking sad 
back seat , organic chemistry , can't see the marker board , just don't know why i'm not watching the match
i'm glad were 2 up but our style of play is total shiiiiittttt 
would love for to just , for once , kill the match early ... #2pl
fellaini has been poor again . not the solution to our midfield people were suggesting . looks like a fish out of water at 
manchester utd without rooney
cleverly and fellaini just not good enough 
manchester next month ! xmas night out .. can't wait to dress up and look the bollocks
glory glory manchester united !!!
 will do good by subbing fellaini for anybody .... even lindegard 
cardiff city 1-2 manchester united
mufc central midfield is terrible in particular fellani 
cmon united we need a 3rd asap 
no carrick no defensive midfield . 
midfield constantly out run here .. fellani struggling again 
look at the trends on twitter !!! and 
our midfield is absolutely phenomenal : valencia , fellaini , clevz , welbeck - watch out premier league ! 
heard his name ring out around the stadium as fans of manchester city celebrated winning the euro cup . 2014
what is fellani doing in a manchester united shirt ? he is absolutely terrible ! shit hair , shit player
chicharito has been very good for manchester united . 
cardiff city vs manchester united ! 1-2 
 provin haters wrong week in and week out
sir alex or not , this is a typical united away match . take a lead , spend the rest of time praying . 
finish it lads . one goal lead is fucking dangerous as ever . 
driving back to manchester ! 
oh so that clown is in manchester now .. im leaving no bye

 tickets >>> eastern bloc , 5a stevenson square manchester m1 1dn
cardiff are a metre quicker than utd . 
wth is going on ? stop playing long balls , keep possession and keep it simple . 
feel sorry for tottenham fans they probably set off about 6 this morning to get to manchester and theyve got beat 6-0 now anotha4 hours back
fellaini gives the ball away and then gets run through with ease . happens too often . 
nw# manchester united vs cardiff city . > harap man . u kalah !!!

wknder if everton do money back guarantees ?

70'min : cardiff city 1-2 manchester united ( w . rooney 15 ', p . evra 45 ' ) ( f . campbell 33 ' )
cleverley and welbeck on the pitch at the same time - uh oh ! 
cardiff city ( 1) .... manchester united ( 2) ..... go cardiff city go ... malaysia boleh
cleverly and fellaini providing less backbone than a jellyfish 
good lord tom almost scores against us ... get this kid off moyes !! 
20 mins left ! hold on cause you're the champions . maybe score a couple yeah ?! 
the united midfield is just terrible , probably the worst midfield in the top two division . 
remember the day when our midfield being overplay by cardiff lol 
dogs 
bring on giggs 
cardiff are definitely on a mission ... hang in there 
fellaini and cleverly are shocking in the middle . offering nothing . 
manchester city 6 - 0 tottenham hotspurs . how ?????
and that is the " wtf , evra ?" moment i've come to expect . what kind of tackle was that ? 
fellaini ..... not worth 27quid never mind million 
should of took the manchester double today . easy bet and i bottled it . utd vs cardiff not over yet though 
get well soon nobby stiles 
we need to score again ! 
has delighted the fans of manchester united with the signing of thiago . 2014

vex i not home to see dis game boi . 
cardiff city 1 manchester united 2
come on 
hate manchester united
cleverley , playing as the 12th man for cardiff in this match . 
72 - good spell of city pressure here . another corner won by caulker . 1-2 
not convinced in any one way yet that is fit to wear the shirt . don't like his attitude . touch of the about him ! 
god are beyond awful today !
wayne rooney's hair looks more like my pubes than my pubes do . 
seriously we might as well have 2 cones in the centre of midfield 
playing very poorly , 
could someone please teach how to make a defense ? 
oh cleverley you're not very clever , are you 
glory manchester united
cleverley is awful . bring giggs on ffs ! 
cardiff dominating ! 
smalling best player which says it all
i was supposed to be going manchester on friday 😭
we need a 3rd here quickly !! 
won't make a difference if cleverly wasn't there . they're running past him anyway . wish moyes would take him off . 
manchester united are such a jammy football team .
torn between supporting manchester united or cardiff right now
we are under so much pressure ..... 
someone plz tell me manutd we've won ...
smalling has been outstanding i must say ... 
thiis match and we will be backkkk in the top 5 of the league table !! united united all the wayyyy !! champ20ns !!! goooo ♥
the usual heart-beat stopping dicey play from .. .. defensive line-up not getting support from mf at all ..
c'mon man united !!!!
uneasy few moments here . united to gain their composure again . get the ball into the other half . 
the lunacy of cardiff's kit-colour change further demonstrated by the bluebirds wearing red , and the red devils in blue . 2
cardiff hasn't beaten manchester united since november 1960 .
what the hell is happening ? 
it remains a heated encounter at cardiff . utd concede a free-kick which rooney heads out for a corner . ddg punches the corner clear 
can hold on ?
cardiff though ( face palm) .... i cannot deal with the minor heart attacks ..... c'mon united ! stop faffing around ! 
oh fuck off having a go at cleverley you cunts 
oh dear god welbeck , cleverly , fellani and smalling playing . bring on young and i promise you kells celtic would win this one . 
oh dear , chris would be embarrased ( manchester city beat tottenham 6-0 )
come on united ! hold it down ! 
jittery moments in the match now . typical manchester united . 
afraid we gonna lose 2 pts if we dont score a third goal at 
come on united ! 
c'mon united ! too many chances given ! 
wake up , ! you're letting cardiff get too much possession !
how can a team have some of the best away fans in the league yet have such a laughable set of home fans ? 
on the way home from manchester after a fantastic day out ...
wayne rooney's hair looks more like pubes than my pubes do . 
manuel pellegrini reflected on manchester city's 6-0 premier league hammering of tottenham at the etihad stadium as the perfect performance .
yaani we are leading bt ........... 
hope this isn't going to have a southampton conclusion 
absolutely no creativity in this match and still don't understand moyes ' decisions 
cardiff pressing manchester united
the score stands at man u 2 cardiff 1 . 69m . evra handball foul ... out for corner 
we'd better not screw this up . 
uniteddd !!!

de gea claims a corner confidently and his attempts to initiate a counter-attack are halted with a cynical block . 
can't believe cardiff fans are booing ryan giggs . absolute disgrace . .
eagerly waiting for the 4th place <3 are coming .

how fickel are those cardiff fans ? booing one of if not thier greatest ever internationals , just because he wears a mufc shirt ? shocking .
giggs deserves that ! he deserves everything 
giggsy will tear you apart ;) 
cardiff are going to score a late leveller from a set-piece ... 
ferguson is a manchester united diehard fan
why giggs tho ? where is the mvp of the championship we acquired last season ? where is ? it baffles me . 
i loathe but i must give props to giggs , even though the red devils stole his youth .
this game is already tainted . rooney should've been sent off long ago before he scored and every manchester united fan knows it .
aaron has a friend called dennis that flew over to manchester from dublin to watch spurs .. happy birthday dennis 😂

giggs will help calm everything down which we really need ! cleverly can't defend for shit

 pressure is due to a pathetic midfield . should fix it tho '. 
wtf !!! giggs ??? 
getting boo'd playing for the first time in your home town ... tough crowd . especially someone as deserving as giggs 
vintage welbeck ! 
such a poor performance all round . no creativity . very lucky to be 2-1 up . 
bring on in nani 
welbz needed a better touch . what a ball from giggsy ! 
way back in 2007/08 season we had a string of 1-0 and one goal margin victories . we know how that ended . 
the fergie reactions are being missed 
for someone of giggs ' caliber , who is born in cardiff and played for wales 60+ times to get booed is just digusting . 
here's giggs for his 18376574827289th appearance .
 sir alex in cardiff
what a ball by giggs .. one more goal boys !! 
ryan giggs on for manchester united .
giggsy playing against him home town cardiff , it only took 40 years 
it's touching that sir alex , even after retirement , still goes to the manchester united games . 😭❤️
whenever i wish scum to lose or draw they end up winning ! i am supporting them today ffs !! 
marshal did well there 
why are people moaning that giggs is being booed ? why would they cheer him ? we wouldn't cheer every player that was born in manchester .
what a ball from giggs . typical from welbeck 
the manchester markets are amazing
here come ryan giggs still have a little crush on that man he maybe 40 soon but plays like he is 20 yummy 
so cardiff boos ryan giggs . 
cardiff city booing giggs because they are upset he never joined . instead he opted for manchester united .
manchester are doing good today .
sunday futbal let's go red devils !! 
what a ball by the legend !!! welbeck coudn't take it properly 
cardiff fans booing one of their own , classy ! 
manchester united playing without a midfield . fellaini + cleverly = fever .

117 - cardiff city becomes the 117th club ryan giggs faces in 952 games as a manchester united player .
 : ryan giggs comes on to play a club game for the first time in the city of his birth .

storybook setting if giggs can score against cardiff 
sir alex really looks like he wants to yell at someone . 
manchester united ftw beibeh !!! ♥
the problem is manchester united's best passer is a bench-warmer . micheal carrick . when that guy is on form passes find players at will
the day danny welbeck gets sold to sunderland will be fucking glorious 
come on manutd . score another goal
cardiff city fans booing giggs because he's won more in his career than cardiff have since they were founded 
puts a smile on my face every time i see alex ferguson at a united game . 
ryan giggs .... still playing at the highest level in football 5 days from his 40th birthday ... what a man !! 
ryan giggs gets a boooo 
manchester united are playing poorly , no vision no creativity in the middle pack
would be quite classic if giggs scores now after coming on and being booed by cardiff city supporters 
i'm sorry but this is really poor !

welbeck being welbeck . we need more than that danny !

cardiff fans clearly aren't football fans ! how can they possibly justify booing giggs ? 
i can't believe manutd is struggling to have a grip on this game .
david moyes is shooting himself in the leg with his constant persistence with ryan giggs , need a #10 attacking mid-fielder now !

where's fat lad ando when you need him 
this is such a disjointed display 
the match is getting bored 
giggs comes on in the city of his birth to loud boos from cardiff support . a shame , considering he's a welsh footballing legend . 
ryan giggs - at 40 he's still playing football at the highest level . #11 
this game is so lack-lustre 
i'm willing to bet giggs doesn't give two hoots that he's playing in cardiff 
just seen an asian guy wearing 13 in red come on the pitch and genuinely thought it was park ji sung 
i wonder if tom cleverly and chris smalling would be involved in the england set up if they didn't play for manchester united football club !
evra heard my cry n scored ... chicharito its your time to shw us wat u capable off

why don't mufc send saf off to the far east to do some ambassadorial work ... must be doing moyes head in , to have him in stands .
right . team instructions changed to retain possession , shorter passing , work ball into box and stand off opponents . 
i don't want any heartbreaks today sha . 
we need a 3rd to seal this game , it's got 2-2 written all over it !! 
how dare the cardiff fans boo giggs ! just because he has more talent than their whole team put together

kagawa plays for mufc ! epic fail ! 2 
such a shame the rules prevent us loaning fellaini to everton for lukaku 
they are booing giggs . so much lol 
manchester united would be safer with laurel and hardy as a midfield partnership than this cleverley and fellaini pair . 
i've said it in the past and i will say it again : welbeck is the worst joke in history .
watching sir alex watching games , sometimes feels like moyes is just fronting . like the retirement thing was just a like bee deal .. :/
cardiff city 1 ( campbell 32 ' ) 2 manchester united ( wayne rooney , evra 45 ' )

there's a part of the manchester united team's training kit that sir alex didn't bequeath his successor !
lot of love for on my t/l this evening . can't imagine why . 
hats off to taxi drivers : ott beeping & absolute gooners driving on the roads in the city centre -patience of saints . 
january's shopping list .. attacking midfielder , and a right back .. at least .. 
we need to get cardiff on the counter attack as they as dominating our midfield and the game at present . tough last 10 mins ahead 
ryan giggs has now played at least once against 45 teams in the . 
giggsy on .. nearly 40 yrs of age what a true foot balling legend 
hang on ! did cleverley just successfully pass the ball to a team mate ? 
hernandez was subbed off for giggs in what was a quiet day for him . still , his flick to rooney for the opener was tidy wasn't it ? 
haha our midfield is practically non-existent in the second half . 
ladies and gentlemen , ryan joseph giggs returns to his home town in united colours for the very first time !

ryan giggs comes on for hernandez . this is giggs's 952nd game for manutd
has fellaini passed a ball forward ? 
this is what i call clinical . according to match stats , manchester city had only 47% possession against spurs who " shaded it " & lost 6-0 !
it's a bit to nervy for my liking right now 
a backpass with a hint of danger - the manchester united murder mystery .

cardiff booing their own giggs ! doesn't get much worse does it ? 
giggsy legend : * i don't knw how the born in cardiff shit even matters .. 
moyes is one malnourished looking cunt he has got rickets or typhoid the infected zombie faced horror bag c'mon cardiff v

what did i just say ? fellaini is brilliant inside the box 
this is embarrassing to watch ... not the to the standard .
joe hart will start manchester city's midweek game against viktoria plzen ( espn )
getting too defensive here imo . need another 
would love to see welbeck or giggs get a goal today would be great for either player . think welbeck needs it more though . 
just tuned in to the united game , i've missed so much already .... c'mon lads , im watching now !!

ha ! na dis chinco guy ruin mancity that time o ! 
{ littiemonalisa } you're awesome and im glad you came and spoke to me in manchester :)
cleverley bc , take him off 
we don't want repeat of southampton encounter . just add one . 
come on manchester !!!!
i've never hard a manchester united player more . it's not coincidence we've been on a unbeaten run since he's been injured 
we don't want a repeat of the southampton encounter . just add one . 
watching the man u game and an asian player for the other team is #13 .... that was park's number for mufc . i miss park 😞 
tottenham vs manutd i will go with a 3-3 draw on that day
 missing carrick badly
i'm worried about ' s midfield , we should never have sold ronnie wallwork !!
i wouldn't likwe to have the moyes stare at me . 
if cleverley is ' the answer ' the question must be ' who's not quite good enough ?'. 
i've never seen a team so poor at keeping possession . 😭
nice to see giggs on hope he can get te third and ensure the win 
haha my dads got two chinese clients over , and they wanted to go shopping somewhere again after going manchester .. they ended up in crewe . 😅

watching football manchester united v cardiff today but my team mu just too osm
wish it was a school inside manchester town hall , i would totally go because it's a mini hogwarts !! 
tom ! 
the most decorated club player of all time is a cardiff lad , you'd think the inbred cunts would be proud and welcoming as he walks on . 
how magical would it be if scored ? 
would have liked to see anderson get a chance -- 15 odd minutes . 
afro guy in united's midfield has been the worst of them all replace him ! 
jack wilshere or cleverly ? 
weird lineup for today's manutd game
hold on for another 10 mins lads 
on my way into manchester to go to church . trying manchester :)
good lord manchester city 😲
 cardiff city vs manchester united
watching play this badly is painful . it's bad for my internal organs .
don't give away silly fouls pliz ... 
carrick is the best .
from glorious comebacks to nervy endings ( . _ . ) 
tom cleverley is an england international .... wow . 
ryan giggs on , probably his last match in cardiff . 
wouldn't of paid in washers for his performances so far this season . 
this game has really gone off the boil in the 2nd half 
actually what cardiff fans problem with our manunited ?? pfftt .. 
match looks like it's getting tense 
 playing his 666th epl match for 
despite my love for christmas , united had to go first !!! 
your night should be done cleverly ... 
tom cleverly is really not that great of a player . i'm increasingly unimpressed with him . 
80 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united

clev having a mare

cardiff city schools manchester united on how to pass and intercept .
cardiff city vs manchester united
i know all fans know this but we really need a few midfielders badly
cardiff city is 117th team ryan giggs has faced in his manchester united career .
heskey > cleverley 
yeah , right . like putting on mr. dinosaur himself will help . it won't . 
cardiff city becomes the 117th club ryan giggs faces in 952 games as a manchester united player .
cleverly is having a shit game . 
cleverley was a flop today . 
tom cleverley .... england midfielder .... afraid to make tackles , master of the 2 yard pass . sort it out tom . 
80 - whittingham sends in the free-kick but caulker heads it over . 1-2 
come on united !! 
our passing is atrocious today 
let's go manchester !
no rvp , vidic , jones , kagawa still playing beeter as a team 
cleverly has been good . realy good . kept the ball . passed it around . fellaini not been great on the other hand in open play . 
i would love to see the distances between cleverley and fellaini in this game . 
manchester united ! -2-1 vs cardif sity
manchester united vs munich 1999 european final 3min comback 
in pain watching united play , haven't turned up today 
manchester united defending dangerously
i've never hated a manchester united player more . it's not coincidence we've been on a unbeaten run since he's been injured 
cardiff fans with boos for one of the greatest players the region has seen . incredible . the best part : giggs wouldnt give half a fuck . 
6 of the best for manchester city !!!! man city : 6 tottenham : 0
we need to win this , c'mon you red devils !! 
come on united !!!!! 
west ham are eyeing a loan move for former manchester city striker felipe caicedo . ( the sun ) 
trolling manchester united fans is easy because most of them have the iq of a lettuce .
when all is said and done , haven't been the same team since larsson left . 
cardiff city 1-2 man united into the last 10 mins can united see out the win or have cardiff got an equaliser in them ? 
last 10 minutes come on lets hold on for a massive 3 points . 
come on united | attack attack attack 
welbeck has over 100 appearance with about 20 goals yet he plays for a club like manchester united
tom cleverley needs to be shipped off to league one to learn his trade . 
sir ryan giggs . 
i can't believe ryan giggs got booed when he came on , playing in his home town ! 
i have not seen any offensive play from marouane fellaini this evening . something needs to change ! his passes are all defensive !! 
yes welbeck by all mean just give the ball n urs too to the goal keepee .. yess man .. brrr that should hv been a goal 
ayo 3 poin 
manchester united are diabolical .
don't bring bellamy on malky ! :) 
 is playing really bad today . why is he still in ? 
lovely day in manchester with my mum 
it's like standing on the cliff of a high mountain 
fellaini is doing his best , winning balls , disturbing play n attacks . pls , what's cleverley's work in this game ? 
aon = arsenal owns nothing , team 
united need carrick back asap !! no structure without him in the middle of the park !! 
shopping in manchester and knowing my way round is always so much more better
ah danny . 
just seen in crowd at game . have to say , completely passed me by .
14 second goal by manchester city ? safe to say that tottenham is a joke .
a club of 's stature don't have a proper midfielder absolutely pathetic ! cleverly is not even a championship side player ....
it feels like we dont want to score 
saf got the best from our " average " players , at the moment they just look devoid of confidence 
can kingsland come to manchester now then please
good lord get some more in niggurs 
manchester city 6 . tottenham hotspurs 0 . god . natt .
reminds me of the soton game . please score another . ffs welbeck 
united time !! 
mr. moyes should feel free to sell tom cleverly in january , out of his depth in the big games and evidently in the not so big games 
cleverly and fellani chasing shadows .. cleverly i'm ok with , fellani i'm not cause we paid a fucking fortune for that muck .. 
' 80 cardiff city 1-2 manchester united 
but while i'm laughing at tottenham , i am still extremely scared of manchester city . not 0-6 scared , but scared .
we should be able to pull this through 
we just gonna sit back final 10 minutes aren't we ? -_- 😒😒 
welbecck , come on ! 
welbeck finish that 
81 - chance for united there . welbeck runs on to a neat one-two with rooney , but fires over . 1-2 
a defensive game this bad is discouraging , but probably an anomaly . manchester city should be winning the damn league .
that miss may well come back to haunt them 
welbeck wow 
welbeck you fucking son of a dick head u bastard 
great play but welbz should be scoring those . 
the glazers must bring back paul " the one who got away " pogba back to fill the creative vacuum in midfield 
shocker welbeck botched that 
dammit welbeck . rooney just handed it to you . 
what a good bit of play there . 
better from wazza welbeck ! 
losing patience with cleverley , never controls a midfield and always making silly errors . he's never going to be good enough for us 
welbeck is not good in finishing 
nice close try by welbz ! after an assist by rooney . keep it up 
to say the fellaini/cleverley partnership is shit would be flattery 
117 - cardiff city becomes the 117th club ryan giggs faces in 952 games as a manchester united player ."
ryan giggs comes on to play against the city of his birth almost 40 years ago ! incredible 
welbeck and the terrible finish again 
welbz , ya gotta finish those !!! 
second half we are literally non-existent . 
oh welbeck , so close . 
welbeck has to do better there ! 
omg what a miss welbeck x_x 
mautd go for gool 
welbeck .. that was close mahn 
fellaini : * attempts to pass * manchester united fans : can you not
of course that's welbeck , he would always miss .. 
danny welbeck is honestly worse than emile heskey at finishing 
cleverley wouldn't get in the west ham midfield so how the fuck can he play for united and england 
i was in manchester like 3 weeks ago when i was meeting bmth and there was a croc store what's worse is that people were in their
who was the last ex man utd player to score against man utd before fraser campbell did today ? 
welbeck , yuh hadda finish dem tings ! 
wellbeck you are worthless look at that pass by rooney 
welbeck !!.. wth ??..: | 
welbeck had to be doing better there 
how did he miss that ? 
get that outta here !! 
wellbeck misses a finish ... typical .... 
cardiff city - manchester united 
ahhh welbeck ! brilliant rooney !! 
 is useless , 
typical welbeck 
last 10 minutes come on lets hold on for a massive 3 points . 
welbeck is so wasteful !!! 😡😡😡 
what a pass from waz . c'mon on man danny , gotta score !!! :'( arghhh 
wellback ... ap mar jao :\ 
welbeck tosser ! as usual lacking composure ! 
fucking welbeck . 
if that was in an england jersey would have buried that . 
welbz wtf , did the hard part , just needed to place it ! 
that was beautiful from welbeck and rooney ! 
we are follow united 
welbeck welbeck wtf 
welbeck should have wrapped it up there ... 
how can he not score that volley ! brilliant pass by rooney there 
come on finish it you numpty 
dang , i miss the " kick " from . anyone have a clip ? 
welbeck ta race fallait mettre sa . 
welbs just missed a sitter smh 
welbeck and his woeful finishing 
food stop then another long ride back to manchester
that rooney welbeck partnership would've put wilshire's goal to shame ! 
oh , danny the local lad . still haven't up your ante on the finishing area . 
danny welbeck is absolutely awful . need to sell him 
knowing ymas are in manchester tonight is making me really really sad :(
wellshite 
welbeck please just leave manchester united i am beggging you
wellbeck does business as usual . 
i love welbz but he can't shoot for shit . 
fuckin welbeck and cleverley 
if danny welbeck could finish ..... 
cripes that was a beautiful buildup . deserved a cherry on top . 
welbeck and cleverley dont deserve to put on a manutd shirt
welbeck drives me nuts . have to score there . 
why does welbeck play for manutd 
i feel we need 1 more goal to seal the match 
ryan giggs is way past his prime . high time for him to think about retirement 
80 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united
united attack not looking as sharp as it should , what's going on 
are referee officials afraid of manchester united players ???
come on united 
oh ! what a chance for welbeck ! that goal would probably seal the game for manchester united ..
oh danny boy 
maybe anderson on for cleverley ? he's tired and not in great form today 
i've always said that welback isn't good enough ! with finishing like he will furthers my point 
ohhh ! what a goal that would of been 
fuck !!!!! what a miss !!!! :-/
welbeck should have finished that ! 
welbeck ! at manchester united you are expected to score that .
snap mu better hold it now . 
jealous of everyone who are seeing #30stm in manchester tonight !: (
why is that cleverley guy still playing for 
like my mam & her friend paid £90 for a chinese sit down in manchester
's coach has the gift of making substitutes
thierry henry is on for manchester united .
we need a third goal here .. come on welbeck 
i always feel that fellaini always tries not to take responsibility . anyone else feels so too ? 
welbeck always shits in the final third !! 
i'm not sure my heart can take many more games like this , get a grip lads 
what the welbeck .. oooh man miss such n opportunity ... nice pass by rooney .. 
kemonnn manchester united
go go go manchester united . come on united
champions league : manchester city goalkeeper joe hart set for recall 
danny welbeck 40 chances before he converts 1 
wellbeck should have won the game there . excellent from rooney . 
trying to figure it out ... cardiff are playing like a premiership side or man u are playing like a championship side ? 
welback will always be an asshole . i don't know who told you that you can be a striker . 
welbeck needs to learn how to finish have said this so many times that's what he will be judged on 
cardiff vs . manchester united
danny ! so close 
manchester city have scored 17 goals in their last three home games .
today marks pat evra's 350th appearance for manchester united . "
how does welbeck play for manchester united ??!!?!!?!
cleverley .... gets paid to play football .... just let that sink in for a while ... not just gets paid but plays for manchester united ....
 not again lost another chance 
danny welbeck you wasteman , should off finished the game there . .
what a fantastic pass by welbeck just ruined it 
it's wellbeck ... what did you expect vs 
... we need one more goal guys !! 
what a miss ? 
oh lovely were winning ! just finished work :) 
going to to manchester mall today for the first timee 👍
oh my god ! mr. tukul shoot , but just near the target . 
poor from wellbeck after class set-up by rooney 
that is danny welbeck in a nutshell 
please , score one more . 
no manchester united fan's heart right now is beating normally
manchester christmas markets were amazing made even better by scott popping into selfridges and getting my ysl clutch 😍
that sums up danny welbeck . fantastic link up play , not good enough in front of goal 
every other person in manchester has the same coat as me : l
welbeck is trash . i dont understand how this nigger ever gets play time 
cleverley has plenty to offer a midfield 3 - with his pace and industry - but he offers fuck all both creatively and defensively 
i have a better finishing than welbeck 
outstanding link up play between  and welbeck  
so many players at united who aren't good enough for the shirt 
another chance goes begging 
manchester city 6-0 totenham
if anyone could gift me manutd's away jersey , that would be great .
why welback still play for manutd beats me ... that boy is useless 
if welbeck knew how to finish he would be a very good striker 
and that is why welbeck should be on the bench 
no team can rotate players and have back to back wins like 
if only could finish !!!! 
twice from welbeck now . he really is allergic to the box 
welbeck please improve you're shooting 
evans saves the day . 
82 ' corner para manchester united
can't help but think chico or robin wudda put that away 
wow this is a tense game , need to get another goal to relieve the pressure 
80 ' cardiff 1-2 : manchester united .
danny welbeck is fucking awful 
that could have been best goal by welbeck ever ..... what a sensational pass by rooney 
corner for . come on fellaini , fucking head it in
10mins left we can do this ! 
frazier campbell has a face that i would pay to watch getting smashed , i see wellbeck still can't finish !! fuck sake lad 
well done rooney ! 
here's hoping d fletcher gets over his illness soon . fellaini & cleverley not good enough for 
corner for manchester united 
welbeck ! he needs some practice sessions on his finishing . rooney's been a class act though ! 
can we score a third already ? 
danny welbeck is not a pure goalscorer ! pure waste of space 
welbeck is fucking terrible ! 
welbeck fi do betta 
the problem with welbz is that he's not a decent finisher even though i really like the boy 
welbeck , you're a one big piece of shit ! 
no surprise welbeck missed there .. takes him like 10 chances to usually get 1 goal 
love love love manchester at this time if year ! <3
welbeck o welbeck when will you learn to score 
c'mon manutd
i personally believe danny welbeck is a useless footballer . 
welbeck's finishing lets him down as he misses a good chance on the half-volley following a nice utd move . 
synonym of determination is wayne rooney 
if danny welbeck can play for manchester united ... so can i ! hmph 
and that is why welbeck doesnt okay .. that is a must score !! 
evans has been good today . 
fuck me i am going to have a heart attack at this rate 🙈 
they looked much more dangerous earlier in the match . you feel the danger has gone out of the game from a manchester untied perspective .
stop embarrassing yourself moyes . stay back in wales , take a bus to scotland and never return to manchester 
why is always falling on his backside when taking a shot ?! such a good striker except for that .. 
thats the welbeck we know and love . 
welbeck remains horrendous . 
brilliant by rooney !! 
wazza's 1 touches are class 
so close , welbz . so , close . 
have evans and ferdinand ever played together before ? 
thank you - we now have 17,000 followers ! we are back in manchester this week getting ready for the world cup final ! 2013
lol i even went on the virgin train to stoke from manchester yesterday :)
that would have been such a top goal by welback !! 
mufc mf welbeck !!!! he can never score !!
ffs danny you've been given 2 on the plate , finish your fucking dinner ! 
beercans manchester take me there
 no more goals for manutd
never comfortable with a single goal lead ! strange things do happen ; more so with how is presently playing !
smallings defense had been fantastic 
welbeck should have done a lot better with that . cambell is the threat here .
has delighted the fans of manchester united with the signing of gokhan inler . 2014
welbeck please improve your shooting 
the transition from fergie can no longer be used as an excuse , manutd has the talent and potential , moyes taking too long 
campbell has been brilliant though . good team . 
82 - almost ! campbell heads down a noone cross but city just can't quite turn it home ... 1-2 
good defence evans !!! 
up manutd !! 
actually scared if manchester
evra might have scored a goal but his defending has been very poor . 
 is playing incredible today ! taking on anyone ! 
well its obvious welbeck still cannot score so the long lay off has not helped his shooting skills 
johnny on the spot sweeps away to a run from rooney who brightly goes and wins a corner . 
it's welbeck .. what did you expect from him ??? vs 
makes me angry having to see cleverley and welbeck play in a united shirt and have people making excuses for them . atrocious players . 
twats , thought we scored 
rooney = pressure relief valve 
come on welbeck ! that should have been a goal ... 
technically the english players are terrible , twice wellbeck failed to control the ball 
welbeck !!! we're the ones in blue silly ... jeez ! 
that's why u don't start games wellbeck you tit 
bouncy hair has been shite . no flair , no style , no urgency , no nothing 
rooney is the man of the match for me ! 
oh rooney's first touch 
my man jonny evans 
i can just sense from 5 minutes until the end and onwards will just be so nerve wracking . 
 are boring negative and aren't playing fluently or with any creativity . valencia isn't there also 
messi missed again i mean welback 
what a huge difference not having carrick has made 
welbeck for mufc still not a quality finisher - it's a long wait .
i think danny welbeck may be some kind of hipster striker who thinks , like , it's totes vulgar to score and stuff , you know 
danny " steve urkel " welbeck . " did i miss that ?" 
even my bro-in-law's hating here also ; mehn ! i just can't escape em no matter what !........ 
how is cleverley still on the pitch ?! !!!
fellaini and cleverely are united's central midfielders today . take a moment to think about that . 
what will it take for to score ? good lad with lots of skill and pace but lacks that killer final touch . 
welbeck still not getting it done re scoring goals . if he can solve that little problem , he'd be invaluable . 
" you're just a fat granny shagger " 
am i the only person who thinks manchester ain't for them ..
welbeck's finishing ? 
that would of been better than wilshire's goal ! 
i got cramp whilst making love to my wife last night darren so i feel your pain 
sub manchester united make their first change as danny welbeck replaces adnan januzaj ( 68 mins ) 
 dreadful performance from fellaini bring anderson on
wales might be a rugby country , but giggs is their greatest ever sportsman ! booing him was embarrassing and disgraceful . 
 arsenal owns nothing .... 4ever
just hold on now 
danny welbeck does what danny welbeck does best . miss , horrendously ! fuckin pile of shit
can we please just throw danny welbeck down a hole and leave him there ?! 
 ...... putting me on the edge of my chair ...
manchester city qui bat 6-0 tottenham
wankers want us to sign 4 new players in january , cos cleverley is playing well , so they can't slaughter him off . 
come on boys 10 minutes to go . hold on for the 3 points 
want to go manchester😞
centre midfield has been a complete waste of space today . fellaini and cleverley both not good enough for a manchester united midfield .
how welbeck is a premier league , manchester utd & england player is beyond me .
jesus dis ppl want 2 give me heart attack ....... 
 welbeck keeps wasting the opportunity
lol remember when the manchester united fans insisted sturridge was a rip off and that danny welbeck was better than him ? me too haha 
what's welbeck still doing at ? average crap
its an insult for people like welbeck , cleverly and smelling to put on a manutd jersey , 
welbeck disappoints a lot more than he impresses me . 
unlucky welbeck , beautiful buildup nonetheless 
and that's the finishing of an international how welbeck still gets called up is beyond me 
ggmu and mufc trends
christmas shopping in manchester next week with family aw
corner for manchester
manchester united
holding out a game hasn't been out strong point under moyesy , hope we can tonight 
1 goll again manchester united ... pleaseeee
a sunday off from work means finally watching a game . nice to see ryan giggs still tearing shit up . a legend mr. wayne .. a legend .
welbeck would make a fine gaelic football player 
wat an interception !!!! 
come on manutd see this out
how i wish lose on today's match !
 !!
can we organise a meet up or something in manchester tho i went to a dive bella dive fan meet up in manchester and it was loads of fun
holy moley batman !! that was close 
if manchester wins the diff will be two points , the pressure is not good .
let's just leave danny here in wales and take campbell back home with us ?! 
felliani has still done nothing to excite me in a united shirt 
another goal would be good . 
miss carrick massively 
may haters live long to shout " ooppss very close " again
welbeck bc kabhi to finish kar acha ! 
come on lads get one more to kill the game off 
step up fellaini . goal ! goal ! goal ! 
tbh i think tonight is gonna be a no-sleep-lotsa-caffeine-and-coursework kinda night when i get back from manchester
another landmark day for ryan giggs as he plays for the first time in his hometown of cardiff ... another landmark coming up in 5 days 
keeper hart set for man city return : joe hart will start manchester city's champions league game against viktoria plzen on wednesday ,...
4 here we are 10 3 # rvp20 14 44 1
danny welbeck should probably have sealed this game for manchester united .
rooney have been fantastic if manutd had sold him it won't have been funny dis season
my english accent improves by the minute as i watch manchester united . 👹
this is about grit more than quality now 
search the name ' cleverley ' and it tells you everything you need to know . how is he a mufc and england player ? he's so average it's amazing
manchester united going good yaaaaay ...
keeper hart set for man city return : joe hart will start manchester city's champions league game against viktoria plzen on wednesday ,...
joe hart will start manchester city's champions league game against viktoria plzen on wednesday , says boss manuel pellegrini .
cleverley , fellaini and valencia . what team wouldn't fancy their chances against that midfield ? overwhelmingly average . 
glory glory manchester united > =)
and this is why carrick gets a new 2 year deal at 32 yrs of age . centre mid is a fuking joke . 
manutd are a pile of butt this season !
the message on manchester's jersey a-arsenal o-owns n-nothing
come on 
and that is why welbeck doesnt play ! that is a must score .. 
rooney's touch is unbelievable sometimes . 
now i'm getting really scared .... just one more goal would do 
get well soon nobby ! 
let's kill this game 
giggs , giggs will tear you apart again ! 
you can hold man united , let's do this ! 
would wellbeck get into any top 4 side in europe .... no 
manutd want to score a goal and all they have is welbeck .. will take the whole season to score 1 goal
rooney of life !!! 
switching btn 6 and watching the match ( mufc and cardiff ) has made my head whirl ....... match end now .
we have a shit squad idc what other united fans say 
fuck it's kurt panzer were done for 
 playing cool and going on a winning side !
menit2 terakhir and i believe the winner is manchester united !! ♥
a turn of pace from rooney ? 
sean connery was actually offered a contract to play for manchester united , but turned it down to pursue acting
campbell offthats good news for mufc
had 110 million to buy almost whatever player you want . used it on seven players great players . lost 6-0 to manchester city .. 
finish it before it becomes a desmond
watching the sheer apathy of fellaini and cleverly's performance can weigh heavy on the soul . 
what a poor performance should had thrashed 
did u hear jon ?" there is a calmness when micheal carrick is on the pitch . he is the go to man for the centre backs ". 
great run there rooney , he seems to be the only one giving 💯 
i luv how we treat them in our on home soil . manchester city is my team ..
yeah , but he's our fat granny shagger !!! 
so excited for manchester tomorrow , but getting up at 4 is literally going to kill me
it's the double 
get back mufc
wanna move to manchester when i'm older
 !!
cardiff booing the legend 
yaaaaow ... we just wah and draw/lose dem next match and win , then we'll be 2nd in the tables and .....

david moyes has suggested that midfielder ryan giggs , 39 , will be offered a new one-year deal at manchester united
fuck's sake ! 
and once again welbeck can't finish . 
welbeck is only being welbeck 😂 #مانشستر_يونايتد 
it was great when danny welbeck was a great striker for that one game . 
as usual welbeck continues to miss in front of the goal .. that ws an awesome ball by 
f it all , i'm moving to manchester ! 😝
fellini and cleverly are my two biggest problems in life . 
somebody get me the dark blue shirt !!
glory glory manchester united !

are they singing that wayne rooney is fat and shags grannies , or that he shags fat grannies ? 
 cardiff city vs manchester united
welbeck is poor as a prem footballer .... very poor ! 
that's one hell of a quiff . come on andreas ! 
its official is shit he can't even control the ball and net it only reason he's playing coz being 
with jones carrick and fellaini out of leverkusen game we will have giggs and clev in mid .... 
since when were mufc a one man team ?
lol welbeck cant even kick the ball let alone heading it 
seems derz no midlfield in this game
step up fellaini , c'mon united ! 
man utd still da team to beat ..... go go mufc 
no comments on today's performance . very shaky and below par !! 
manchester city wants to replace joe hart with iker casillas as soon as the winter transfer window opens . sd

welbeck had two chances to kill the game but he rather put the team in pressure . 
manchester is playing like a boss today ! glad to be a fan ! btho cardiff
watching and play gives me hope that as an unfit smoking 35yo i may still get a call from barcelona 
epl standings january 1st 2014 : 1 . liverpool 2 . mufc 3 . arsenal 4 . chelsea 5 . mancity book it .
the way this match is going in the second half , my heart's literally in my mouth . 
glory glory manchester united ~~
80 - whittingham sends in the free-kick but caulker heads it over . 1-2 
just remember what the vidiprinter would have said today : manchester city 6 ( six ) tottenham hotspur 0 
come on united , hold out for a good three points !!!! 
danny welbeck should probably have sealed this game for manchester united
welbeck . like him . but he will never ever be a member of a champions league winning side . can't finish for shite . 
now trends 
so come on cheers the boys ! mufc make some noise ! we're gonna wild wild wild !! we're gonna wild wild wild !!
i can't explain what a terrible forward welbeck is ... 
please can we hold on or get another goal 
manutd football na hypertension
 made me love twitter 
no time for mistakes 
come on just focus and don't mess up now !
not far from the goal to goal - manchester united - ( 2 - 1 ) ( y )
chicharito needs to go to a team where he plays all the time . being plan c in manchester united is not going to work for him .
we could really do with another goal . that would spare my nerves 
just hold plzzzzz 
manchester city 6-0 tottenham ( mcfc : x2 , x2 , ( csc ) et ) 
really strong manchester accents 😐🔫✊ eh eh eh eh shuuuuut up
can see cardiff sneaking one ! come on united !!! 
would it be irresponsible to scrap the entire midfield and start again , bar carrick ?
85 ' cardiff 1-2 manchester utd
comment from behind ' welbeck couldn't score in a brothel ' 
like i mean welbeck should of finished this game off , chicharito would of scored that . 
and draw/lose dem next match and will be within 3pts of them ... then we neatly tek ova the tables and never look back
this midfield makes me cry . oh why oh why did we sell pogba . 
almost welback , good shoot 
someone had the job to put evans on the back if his shirt ..... " eva ns " is doing my head in 
that southampton game result is coming into mind ... 87th min .. kill the game off 
all opportunities seem to fall to welbeck but he's failing to capitalize 
so when do we see that equalizer ? 
manchester united's play deserving a draw ( really ... ) . midfield looks clueless without carrick , the metronome . 
84'min : cardiff city 1-2 manchester united ( w . rooney 15 ', p . evra 45 ' ) ( f . campbell 33 ' )
welbeck infront of giggsy much better outlet 
moyes is not bad , but mu have not found a replacement for scholes 
it's obvious why cardiff fans are booing giggs , he never seemed that fussed about playing for wales especially friendlies . 
park the buss ..,.,, we are almost there ..... 
 plz moyes get rid of welbeck . he's not good enough anymore
85 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united 
you don't even need to be a striker to score that welbeck ! what a mess u have turned yourself into . 
anytym i see the update ma hrt grip 
81 - chance for united there . welbeck runs on to a neat one-two with rooney , but fires over . 1-2 
rodney looks like he's wearing a syrup . 
what carrick does for mufc ....... bushy n cleverly can't replicate
why aren't manutd finishin these skiprats off ? x
so my team manchester utd is winning while am away just like they are ... good job champions ... usiku mwanana nyoute .
giggs gets to play at his place of birth for the first time . must be a proud moment for him . and he's just turning 40 too 
nervous few min . 
i still can't decide if i like manchester united yet or not
cardiff did even show any respect for giggs assholes 
nearly at manchester nsmdmfm
come on keep it tight and its being a good away display :)
why did danny boy screw things up ? 
like the true we are 
i really need to use the restroom but i don't want to miss the last part if the game . hurry up and win 
dts ao manutd climb up to 4th position
why have they swapped kits before the end of the game ? 
rooney performs superbly tnite ! 
85 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united .
manchester city love zot
come on , we've nearly dpne it , let's get this one in the bag 
on the way to manchester to see 30stm now wooo ! i've had four slices of pizza and three slices of garlic bread and i'm happy
rooney looking for his 2nd goal doe 
why does manchester city centre smell like a massive cannabis factory !
i'm going back to manchester a lot calmer , grateful , a little smug/confident , in the knowledge that everything can only get better for me
welbeck . pretend you're playing for england !! 
the old southern supporting manchester problem
thank god campbell is out 
min 86 en la premier league cardiff 1 manchester united 2 .
always a 
bambi should have sealed in for united 
just keep our shape , our discipline , and we leave cardiff with 3 pts & its off to leverkeusen to seal place . 
firstrowsports . eu just decided to go and die with 10 minutes left , need updates or an alternative link 
come on 5 more mins plus added time , bag all 3pts
 please please . one more goal please mu .
manchester united way above dinner
fc barcelona 5-0 real madrid manchester united 1-6 manchester city manchester united 8-2 arsenal
 almost set to get into top 4 
 manchester united 2 vs 1 cardiff city
at last campbell is out , can breath easy
welbeck .... cows arse ..... banjo 
what does bring to the team ? he’s overrated .
welbz just over the bar unlucky 
one more goal please 
we need a whole new midfield . 
manchester united beware of the 89th minute ...
hold on mufc .
20 times 20 times man united , 20 times 20 times 20 times i say , 20 times 20 times man united , playing football the matt busby way . 
cardiff city or manchester united : s
going to be a hard fight till the end 
not a good performance away from home as usual for manutd . were very lucky to get those 2 goals . couple of signings may sort things out
cardiff 1-2 united , , evra , rooney :)
mufc r the beasts just need to defend like champs
we'll keep the red flags flying high ... 
cardiff born giggs will come and score for mufc just as mufc born campbell scored for cardiff
86 - yellow card for tom cleverley after a stern challenge on peter whittingham . 1-2 
cleverley really having a good one .. great 
82 - almost ! campbell heads down a noone cross but city just can't quite turn it home ... 1-2 
5min away frm an away win 
manchester united ...
 its manchester uniteds night ! cardiff city no longer look dangerous like they were at the starting 15 minutes .
when will fellaini be aware that it is the duty of a mf to make through passes and provide assists ? 
sort yourself out tom 
tom clevz should've fucked him . 
one more 
fellaini apparently been studying video footage of paul scholes tacking ... again 
when shrek is in the mood , he is unplayable , ameamua he will single handley carry mufc to top 4 .
we'll never die we'll never die we'll never die we'll never die we'll never die 
 missing carrick massively . think cleverley's done well but they miss the composure and ability on the ball of carrick 
why is cleverly still on the pitch i ask you with tears in my eyes ??? 
fellaini has finally had a good game for united . 
manchester united .
86 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united
cleverly thand khaaa janu !! 
tom is the biggest cock up ever to play with manchester united , wait forgot welbeck ..
david moyes has had a better start to their manchester united managing career than any other manchester united manager
fellaini has been class today 
danny welbeck is like andy cole minus the goals !!! 
united have to find the back of 's net one more time , at least one for the road 
cleverly is bang average 
it's getting dangerous , hope we don't concede . 
just hold on lads 
cardiff in charge of d game . no two ways abt dat . bt manutd efficient as always
i love how united get a ton of breakaways after they take hernandez off the pitch . it always happens . 
screw manchester united . dirty dickheads
just see it out till the end ffs 
tbh , it's a poor second half by manchester united . 😕
if only it culd be full time now 
keep it tight not long left 
waist high tackles now not reds either v watch for cleverly to score now too .
back in top four mufc
rooney might be a fat granny shagger cardiff fans but all of you are sheep shaggers 
yellow card for cleverley .. 
welbeck has missed 3 easy chances already since coming on . that probably would've been a hernandez hat trick . 
need a new cm asap 
why is cleverly still getting playing time ? 
cleverley is nothing but a cocky fuck ! anyway , as long as we win !
cleverly is such a donkey 
loved vintage shopping with megs , manchester has the best shops
one more goal please manutd ..: )
i will be " greyer " than giggsy by the end of season at thjs rate ... 
marroune fellaini is one of the biggest jokes ever perpetrated on . bebe with big hair
yep , cleverly has been shite too 
eleanor jane calder was born on july , 16 1992 in manchester , uk
can't believe cleverley lasted with crap tackles and not good playing in general ! 
 hold it together end it and lay em down ...
manchester united are the luckiest team around .
 is sitting behind on the premier league table . wahala dey oo
i don't know what clevz is still doing on the pitch . 
 it should be cleverless not cleverly
two sloppy yellows this match 
midfield has been so clumsy today , cleverley and fellaini giving away so many free kicks which just invites more pressure . 
goal , assist , some beautiful play and a last ditch block . man of the match is easily rooney . 
welbeck is becoming a problem . the guy can't finish his dinner . horrible . 
what manutd have mastered is the art of conning the ref .
i can see why moyes got more draws at efc . settling to win with 1 goal is so risky esp . in the epl 
wellbeck - prob the most mediocre ' striker ' that has had in recent years . hopefully spurs buy him soon
my boiz are winning ..... 86 minute
at least tops the asshole league .
tom cleverley booked . almost there now . 87 ' gone , cardiff city 1-2 manchester united .
welbeck had a shot but just over did it . 
i cant imagine manchester united without wayne rooney just for a sec also
ummm clev , that was kinda , ummm , ur fault mate . 
cmon lads should put this game bed by nw ! 
fellaini has had a very good gamw . clevs had a shocker . but hey lets not allow that to get in the way of oue routine fellaini bashing 
it would be a sad sad day if cleverley and welbeck make the england world cup squad . can't figure out who's more useless . 
come on lads !! ❤️⚽️
yellow card for cleverley - first thing he's won all day ! congrats ! mufc
9 - manchester united have now gone nine premier league away games without a clean sheet . sketchy .
ryan giggs continues his legendary run of scoring with someone else's wife in every premier league season . 
fellaini & cleverley is not a good combination 
 = of the week
manchester united !!
i hate manchester united always have always will
your guys next task for the next 4 mins is to defend for your fuckin lives !!!! 
im coming back to manchester as an ice cube ...
could be a record number of fouls committed by tom cleverley . 
decent one-two shame about danny's finish 
 how are we winning this game ? midfield is so bad !
fellaini is a foul machine and cleverley had a mare ! desperately need a couple of footballing midfielders ! 
cleverley isn't having a good game . 😕 
c'mon one more goal .
back in lovely manchester
the last few mins are sooo tense !! 
now please hold on . dont fk it up . its already been a bad day with india losing plz dont fk up 
manchester united can't win without help . am ashamed of english football .
how some players get to play 4 is a mystery .. (crappy buffoon) , uncleverley(headless thwart )
hold on united , hold on 
been one spoilt girl today by the mother an father shopping 😘
 
the fiesty encounter continues as cleverley and whittingham clash . 3 minutes plus stoppage time remaining . 
ive said it enough times . cleverly b shite today ! good to see welbeck back . playing well so far .
people actually compared tom cleverley to jack wilshere ? really ? certainly that is over , right ? 
cleverley & fellaini are presently no match for carrick , but both seem to be getting the job done somehow . just . 
at the manchester
got to say the lack of respect for giggs in cardiff has been shocking . no matter what you think of us he is a welsh legend 
sorry where was the foul ? 
 gives the ball away to cardiff .. not sure if hez playin for or against ... cud hv finished the game 
i can imagine moyes shouting " tom , think of the brand tom , think of the brand !" 
 cleverly seems to be drunk very sloppy .
what the hell do you mean cleverley " missed the ball ?" he saw it and kicked something else . so much love ...
whenever i see cleverly play for utd one word springs to mind : why ? 
3 minutes left . exclude injury time . cardiff 1-2 manutd 
lovely day round manchester with the parents 
fellaini wins all the arial battles he's in . 
3min to go !! 
make tom cleverley go away ! 
117 - cardiff city becomes the 117th club ryan giggs faces in 952 games as a manchester united player . 
birmingham & manchester german market this year 😍🎄🎉 
paul scholes on one leg will pass the ball better than fellaini and cleverly 
work experience for two weeks , birthday on tuesday , galway saturday then manchester woohoo can't wait
is the ref malky mckay ? 
come on united lets get the 3 points 5 mins to go 
today's " i am robbing a living " series comes to you from thomas cleverly from manchester
parked the bus vs cardiff . 
honestly , cleverly does not deserve a first team place for manchester united ! what moyes see's in him i don't know
how many dangerous free kicks has cleverley given away ? far too many ! i think his problem is that he's absolutely thick 
3pts is ours 
moyes ruined manchester united bra ☹
hang in there lads . 
come on last 4 minutes !! 🙏🙏🙏
c'mon united see this out !!! 
86 - yellow card for tom cleverley after a stern challenge on peter whittingham . 1-2 
i am nervous come on lads grind it out 
cleverley keeps putting under pressure . i really wish he'd become the midfielder we want him to be ...
yellow card for cleverley - first thing he's won all day ! congrats ! 
rooney nearly flew then… if he'd waved his arms a bit more he would've! 
my dad is always in support of any team against mufc .. i would soon be requesting for a dna test
so what exactly dos hernández do today ???? 
mentality : hard tacklling 
the score line manchester city 6 - 0 tottenham says it all . they are shit as always .
defend ! defend ! defend ! attack ! attack ! attack ! 
manutd limping to 3 points
shit game if i supported i'd be thanking god for 
manutd cant really play that well without carrick in the middle
game is getting bit scrappy . finish it off boys ! 
watching the game wit mio 
hold in there for the win 
easy to blame fellaini , or belittle cleverley . fact is , 2 v 3 in midfield will never be in your favour in today's football . nope ! 
the fact that cleverley plays in the premier league is a surprise to me , let alone manchester united and england . just don't get it
tom cleverly recent display is an utter disgrace . even welbeck is performing better these days 
let's just keep possession 
the midweek champions league match has to be the only reason that fellaini and cleverly are lasting the full game against cardiff . 
tom cleverly is one lucky footballer . he seems more suited to playing for hull or stoke . no idea how he gets in the united team 
it looks like we've spent the whole 2nd half defending our lead 
theophile is such an unfortunately hilarious name . 
why aren't the maine coming to manchester
united need to fix up seriously . 
cleverly gets played basically every game lol 
if cardiff score , its going to be heartbreaking 
manchester city raped tottenham 😂😂😂😂😂
what a negative set of fans cardiff have , spent most of the game booing instead of getting behind their team . lower league mentality 
tyler shut up !!!! about rooney !!! 
having to stand on this train for the whole journey back to manchester 😔 
cardiff city 1 vs 2 manchester united . last 10minuted always define or defie the entire game . 
right so we didn't score again and now we're hanging on . it would be nice not to have to do this sometimes . 
london is great but manchester is duly missed .
lmfao wazza still cant score that chip 
martin tyler is a _________ 
the #1 cause for anxiety in this past 1.5 hours is ! btw we are reclaiming our rightful position !! 
these small clubs will be all over the field on steroids when they're playing against is it a crime to be the best in england ?
davey moyes ' red white army ! 
former n current manutd sponsers acrony meaning . aig arsenal is great and aon arseanal own nothing .
i want to see someone walk up to rooney on the pitch & kick him just to see what the ref does . 
he's done well for himself today 
really , too many cartoons in this team .. welb , clev , young , smalling .. and avg by ferd , valen .. and all play same match ? 
moyes looks like a mad man 
i didn't know missing carrick , van persie , vidic & jones is this painful . 
don't think i hate anything or anyone more then i do manchester united 
west ham are eyeing a loan move for former manchester city striker felipe caicedo . 
moyes is shitting himself . 
manchester united love you♥
the consensus is that united need to resign djemba-djemba . 
evra has score in his 350 apparence with mu 
 - tom cleverley ( yellow card )
what exactly might ' the story ' be about wayne rooney , martin ? i'm not sure you've explained it or mentioned it previously . 
so mufc gonna win cuz they cheated . what a surprise .
manchester city have scored 26 goals in their last 6 home games , insane to be fair
rooney becomes the first premier league to score fifty goals on a sunday ? well i never . 
look le match manchester united 2-1
defend guys 
looks like its time to add another jersey to my collection ! i'm loving these new away ones ! 
after a brief discussion with my 3-year-old son , it has been established that manchester united players are , in fact , " the bad guys ."
we need a few world class players in this team . we can't even pass the ball around for one minute ! 
cleverly is so pony ! should be nowhere near the england squad ! provides absolutely nothing ! 
wayne rooney becomes the first premier league player to score 50 goals on a sunday 
tottenham manager andre villas-boas said his side need to be " ashamed " after a 6-0 defeat at manchester city .
we need more goals ... please !!! 
 getting real lucky . referee is helping them out a bit too .
this is vintage but i don't see where the quality is beyond rooney in order to find their usual feb-may form .
where were the rest of the team when 3/4 cardiff players were all up in clev's face ? poor show is that , lads . 
would love for us to go for pjanic in january . maybe include anderson as part of the deal . midfield cannot go on like this 
wayne rooney is the first player to score 50 goals on a sunday in the premier league . 
one more goal by and it would be a clean lead for us .
how is tom cleverley an england international and plays for manchester united ?
the second best teams in and both were lucky to finish with ten men this weekend 
wellbeck missed a glorious chance , yet he's in the squad because he's a manchester lad
 has tottenham next and look how do them today ... should most def be a walk over us
i can feel the heartbeat of a lot of manchester united fans on my tl ... lol ((( tension )))
playing long balls to felaini , were the hell in the composure were united for fuck sake 
a bit of a ballet-esque jump there from rooney ! 
 under saf would have scored a third 
martin tyler is obvious in his hatred of utd 
manutd need to step up their game . players like carrick , vidic and persie should recover fast
such a fighter fellaini . 
cleverly is desperate to be the worst player on the pitch & i think hes done it . 
are we really playin a game or training ? 
from fellaini's point of view , kama akili ni nywele he should be doin rocket science
can't remember the last time united won convincingly and played well :( good 3 points this thow if we hold out ! 
hotels alias serviced apartments inpouring manchester : uwunwij
smalling has improved a lot 🙌 
on the way to manchester apollo to see the weeknd ! got complimentary tickets from lipa and i don't even go there ! 
here it comes ... 
manchester united triste
hold on guys it just 1 min come on
top 4 if we win right back in the title race ! 
i dunno what has happened to our scoring abilities , we've not been netting like we should 
i want united to sign xabi alonso 
i've still seen nothing that suggests fellaini belongs in a united shirt . 
valencia , welbeck & fellaini don't have what takes to wear ' jersey .
no comments on today's performance . very shaky and below par !! unconvincing . work still has to be done . 
manchester almost have their 10 straight win . 
ugly win against is fine . ugly win against fucking , dafuq ???
manchester united 👏💯😍
the vision of rio ferdinand 
1 coach , 2 buses and 2 trains to get me home from manchester .... and to top it off . i've got a fucking shocking tranny next to me .
its close .... come on lets edge it 
come on my team manchester united :)
this commentator is a genius ... " they just need to keep the ball away from their own goal ". seriously ? 
comeon united hold this now 2mins +stoppages to go 
rooney becomes the first premier league player to score fifty goals on a sunday ? well i never . 
about 5mins + extra .. let's hope we keep the lead n get them 3 points come on !!
89 ' cardiff city 1-2 manchester united
michael buble performs a day before my birthday in manchester .... inevitable i will get tickets ! 
goo 
mufc's get rid list - wellbeck cleverly nani young fellaini evans
wish moyes would give a chance , he couldn't do any worse than some of the players getting in the team at the minute imo 
rooney has become the first player to score 50 premier league goals on a sunday 
wayne rooney becomes the first premier league player to score 50 goals on a sunday 
samir nasri and sergio aguero happy after manchester city beat tottenham 6-0
glory glory manchester united !
y is dis game soo tough 
rooney looks like a sweaty potato . he's a sweatato 
 let's get the points !!
manchester united 💪❤️
carrick . we need carrick . 
common guyz , tryna hold on to dis slim lead ! 
cleverley and fellaini have a great understanding now . they now understand they are both shite . 
 defenders need to be focused & calm !
really not impressed with cleverley's game tonight . 
it's getting very scrappy 
what an ugly game , the back 4 and de gea kept us in this 
 play like a big budget version of stoke these days . shadow of their 90s sides .
aint that some shit 
can't believe were still 1-2 up . largely abject & no midfiled 
cleverly would struggle to get in to top premier league sides , need to replace him in jan with a modric/mata type player
these youngsters have to learn when to tackle and where not to give away a foul 
manchester in february maybe yay
fellaini and cleverly are on different wave lengths . it's like their playing for different teams . 
cleverley just not good enough . 
fuck sake some idiot getting on my case because i said our midfield is so shit in this game . dumb cunt who don't watch matches 
 did far better than i thought . the ref made some terrible decisions . awful ref . worse rooney should never have stayed on . for .
in an alternate dimension , pogba and ravel morrison are bossing united's midfield destroying every team in their wake . 
calm people calm 
referee giving cardiff everything right now 
please hold on 
come on utd ... hold on 
we win today , no . 4 . slowly , inch-by-inch , the way . just like we usually do . usually ! 
samir nasri was happy to see manchester city maintain their unblemished home record
always support manchester united ( y ) 
can't stand seeing manchester united win anything😒 
manchester united is playing !!! let's goooo united justin bieber
cmon united hold the fuck on !! 
ed woodward ... get the transfer lists on ...... we bloody need midfielders ....... 
this isn't the worst man u midfield in the pl - remember when they had eric djemba-djemba and kleberson in there ? 
this cardiff vs manchester united game is intense ! jut waiting for the fight to break out lbs
so who's joining in manchester on 8 dec ? rncm oxford road . it's going to be an afternoon/evening to remember !
now that you decided to play a shitty game , you better hold on for 6 mins 
hi guys i will be uploading my vid from today at manchester airport either later tonight or tomorrow 
i honesty don't know who's shitter . danny welbeck or emile heskey 
come on united ! don't fuck this up in the last few minutes ! 
our best players today have been our back 4 and our goalkeeper . while that's good , cleverly and fellaini have been awful throughout . 
o . m . g manchester city what a beating , m speechless 
united's midfield is absolutely shocking . 
win it already 
we are terrible without carrick 
come on united ! 
do not lose me this bet now mufc !
well sorry manchester united but manchester city game was much more of a footy goal session than this game 
these are the minutes when champions are made . 
as long as god with us , the rest of the world may be against us 
so we shoot two spots up ? 
 manchester city 6-0 tottenham
wetin go pain me pass na make cardiff go equalise for last minute . na beg i dey . plenty tinz dey at stake .
ref : you two come here 
except there's a cardiff magic , this'z gonna be another mufc controversial win .
hold on we going home .... 
most dangous fk position so far for 
manchester united surviving .... this team fake just ... winning on bunkenke
want to go to manchester xmas market 🎄🎄🎄
fellini , cleverly , valencia , welbeck 
cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united . final .

cannot say this enough but i hate cleverly and he's not united standard 
i am still not convinced fellaini is a player . think we should have better quality in the side .
lol at manchester united
liga bbva : athletico - getafe : 7-0 barclays : manchester city - spurs : 6-0

' the ref from the froch groves fight tried to stop this game at half-time ': manchester city 6-0 tottenham in tweets ...
united just don't control the game like they used to 
" manchester united back to winning ways " they said . i'm starting to feel a bit mystical now with my predictions .
rooney got some money on draw ? that was pathetic 
kim bo kyung the name manchester fans would hate .

bad decision making cost us today ! 
oh no ! we failed to hold our 2 -1 lead , 
i said it at the beginning will finish outside the top four
rooney goes close as he finds himself one-on-one but in attempting to pass it to welbeck , scuffs it . 
one step forward , two steps back 
smh 
manchester united ... sir alex reviens !!!!!
fergie time used to go the other way ...

you have to say biggest difference between fergie/moyes eras is we used to relish the last 10 minutes , now we seem most vulnerable 
are you looking forward to tonight in manchester ? :) last night was awsome in london ! see you in a bit !
something called cardiff has just stopped the hearts of man utd supporters worldwide . 
great defending there smalling , fouling at critical areas 
from scoring ' fergie time ' to conceding ' moyes time .' 
the free kick was played and there was a foul afterwards why was another free kick taken ? bullshit not to mention the punch
nooòoooooooooooo . i was already 4th . die 
cardiff lasan lasan .... lol . mufc how market
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggrrrrrrhhhhhh 
worst manutd side i have ever seen
i don't know why this is happening to mufc smh
fucking shit ...

manchester always ends up getting scored on the last minute
moyes can go easy on the altitude tabs this week 
manchester united's worst form
91 ' goal cardiff city . cardiff 2-2 manchester united
seriously ... do we need players who don't show a bit of class and patience .... instead of giving away stupid fouls .... 
90 ' ) cardiff city [ 2 - 2 ] manchester united < england - premier league >
if fuckin welbeck had scored that sitter that any striker worth their own piss would of scored , we'd of win this 
to all mufc fans >>>>>> in your face babe ..
amazing quite how brittle manchester united's confidence is without the ferguson factor
someone in our complex doesn't like we heard the shouting when cardiff scored . it made us change the channel to see what was going on
cardiff 2-2 man . united go go go manchester united
lol manchester united ...
manutd 2-2 cardiff city i'm hoping another goal from rooney seems januzaj are not playing 
lol !! moyes out !!!! terrible display from mufc again . fellaini is so shit . love it . 
it was coming all afternoon i'm afraid . cant defend , static midfield , no creativity . a win was needed today to keep the pace 
manchester united
i don't understand how danny welbeck is a professional footballer and how he plays for manchester united .
wtf rooney ?! 
also , de gea is not an impressive gk . from all my time watching him , his d is generally the reason mufc don't concede ( if they don't )
maybe manchester united aren't so fortunate today lol
cardiff city 2 manchester united 2 joke .
is it cardiff we are struggling against ? ferguson ... argh ! nnukwu ife emee manchester united !
manchester united not getting away with poor displays any more . we always look like we have a mistake in us these days . poor
haha . oh how i love football . just beautiful . 
goal ! cardiff ties with man united ! 2-2 the score is even ! what a great game ? 
he either score or assist . still all come from rooney to bring manchester united on top
first thing i see when i come to manchester markets ...... a clown ..... a fucking clown i hate clowns scary mother fuckers
oh shit . 
cardiff 2-2 manchester united . minuto 93
goal ! kim bo kyung nods home a stoppage time equaliser to grab a point for cardiff 2 2
oh moysie , why oh why had you not brought heitinga on , he would have headed that clear !!! 
welbeck should have score earlier , flog that idiot to the russian league , i can't understand how he plays for manutd , even giggs too
come on , united !! 
what shit this is ... 
well that's unfortunate . 
ed woodward which sponsorships have you signed this week ? 
fuck fuck fuck dem !!!!! aren't . serious with the title race ...

manchester united fans how market
mufc very very poor again today .

this blows 
title over 
come on boys . come on ! 
easily the weakest manutd team ive seen in my life
bruce lee fucking my manchester double bet up get in there lado
a tale of 2 cities , cardiff and manchester .
 sorry ohh ! today's not ur day !
cardiff hasn't lost to a manchester club this season yet 
what is going on ????!!! 
sorry but united deserve this with their clown finishing and shit midfield !
manchester united score anyone ? please someone delight me and tell me they're losing
why didn't rooney just smash that in the back of the net ? smh 
pra que tocar a bola pro conebeck , rooney ? chuta pro gol ! 
it's because we're playing felliani and cleverly 
that was a sloppy defending from manchester united's defenders ...
manchester united disappointed me this game
in other news , wtf was rooney doing there ?! fucking slot it home ! don't pull it back for welbeck ! jeez 
cardiff city scores a dramatic injury time equaliser against manchester united through kim bo-kyung to make it 2-2 
eindstand cardiff city - manchester united : 2-2 
manchester united defense is going haywirr
and they can't make it work 
rooney has to finish that off . huge opportunity missed . 
manchester united 2-2 cardiff city unbelievable how he didn't score then 
well played the ' keeper there , put doubt in rooney mind and made him pass it 
moyes get the fuck out of manchester !
manchester united , ruining accumulators across the country
knew that was gonna happen ! why cant we hold onto a lead ! and rooney what was that ! should have finished that yourself ! 2-2 
lol manchester united
we needed three points today 😭👹 
kim bo-kyung , i love you for that 
when draw or lose it brings joy because most of my friends are manchester united fans and they also laugh when barca lose or draw
what the bilbo baggins was rooney just thinking ? should have gone himself in the first place .. welbeck never would have scored it . 
absolute piss 
last minute equalizer from cardiff city denies utd 3points . 90 ' cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united .
tom cleverley shouldn't be in the england squad , not sure how he is playing for , championship player at best 
think my neighbours kids will now know the word cunt . 
donkey football 
a classic david moyes performance right there . dithering dave at his very best . clutching a draw from the draws of victory . bravo . 😂
another golden moment for cardiff against a manchester team . take a bow bo-kyung kim !
cardiff 2-2 manchester united
2 massive chances to win it 
man utd really are poor this year , worst i have seen in all of my years watching football .
you just had to shoot rooney !!!! 
because , poetic justice mr. wayne rooney . 
 . poor performance welbeck cleverly just not good enough ! we will be lucky to make top 4 this season ! this just isn't good enough
 goal bo-kyung kim ! cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
cardiff city has equalised . i repeat , cardiff have equalised . cardiff city 2-2 manchester united . 
what the hell ?! 
let down . 
speechless !! 
i really wish they'd delay chris brown's rehab so we can get him to beat up moyes and 90$ of the team ! 
manchester are shit .
i could die right now 
for goodness sake united !!! not happy !! we didn't deserve to be ahead anyway !! 
what was rooney thinking ???? 
came on smalling .. 
oh and i'd like to add united are shit :/
 
cardiff have scored 5 goals at home against the manchester sides , incredible .
manchester united -__-
hahahahahaha 
i fucking hate tom cleverley . 100% not cut out for manchester united
goooooooool de kim gooool del cardiff city// manchester united 2-2 cardiff city

david moyes is fuckin manchester up sir alex might have to coach manu again .
kill me now fuck sake !
smalling smalling smalling . why ??? 
that is what you get for trying to hold a one goal lead with half a fucking hour to go you fucking negative bunch of cunts 
i feel really bad for manchester united to be honest 😂
utd are fucking pathetuc fuck this shit bastard team 
should be in manchester right now !
why did that have to fall to smalling . 
typical moyes performace . sit back and soak pressure from smaller teams to protect 1goal leads . respect to cardif though . 
that was the second chance to snatch the win ... 
fuck manchester united !
 cardiffs best player on the pitch ..... chris smalling
 deserved that equalizer . top notch performances from the likes of cleverley again .

eat this you scumbags 
manchester united are fucking shit .
average team we've become under but 
the worst manutd team i've ever seen . fucking embarrasment .
manchester united dim
rooney why ?!? sloppy all around .. deserves nothing truth be told
ohhh united ..... how you break my heart so ! 
manchester united ?....
draw . it's cool . well played boys ! moving up to 4 ! 
why are manchester united so shit ? ahhahahhaha 2-2 go on cardiff !
united miss carrick really bad . 
manchester united you bunch of fucking wankers
manchester utd can suck it !!!
my dad while watching manchester united play ... " no , rooney you wally " such a brit
this is what we get for having a shite centre midfield partnership and playing negatively , instead of attacking . 
standard la manutd ..... losing or about to draw then start to play properly ....
i blame danny welbeck two sitters he missed and is worst player in are squad doesn't deserve his place 
poor united today , for what they deserved 
i act give up with manutd this season 😔
well the match should've been over with that welbeck chance . awfully predictable that equaliser . 
of course manchester united would let me down today .
cheers medel , slapping fellaini's face , then gets the free kick retaken . 
the frustration continues . 
time and time again we continue to invite more and more pressure once we're leading a game and each time we get that same result !! mufc
dear - feel free to put a shot on target . 
come on manchester united
cardiff city 2 - manchester utd 2 . cardiff city stadium , wales . gooooo gooooo cardiff . 93mins .
disapointing performance from the boys @ mufc
manchester united are laughable
smalling showing the same quality for he does for england .
hahaaaa .. dawa ya clubs ! wait for next sat . will tame them for you !
ahhhh , cballs . 
man utd have looked terrible today . going to struggle to hold onto the title at this rate 
em was ferdinand slightly spear tackled there ???? 
manchester united _|_
probably a fair result in the end . we haven't played well enough to win the match . 
i never want to see tom cleverley in a united shirt again , absolutely fucking diabolical today . 
united not good enough again . 
manchester united sucks 😂😂😂 
rio ferdinand got swept off the floor by a man ! lmao 
no way would smalling be an international if he wasn't at 
same story every other week ! this team isn't goin to win anything if we play like this ! pathetic ! 
smalling and cleverley are average championship players at best ! 
two late chances waisted from rooney and smalling . 
disgusting defending & ridiculous f*ck up by rooney & welbeck immediately after conceding 
i fucking knew this shit would happen 
you call that defending ? their fucking shortest man heads it in ! 
cardiff vs manchester united 2 - 2 ayyy diablos .
two chances for manchester united . none converted . 
93mn cardiff 2 vs 2 manchester united
mufc will kill me
manchester united is a dead meat lol ..... rooney to arsenal pap !!!
don't understand how we fucking bottled in 
unbelievable what is going on 
so we settle a draw now 
manchester united are not finishing in the top 6 this season by the looks
we have been shit don't deserve to win 
90 ': good chance for manutd as the ball bounces cleanly for smallings , but his attempt goes begging .
manutd , first of all .... go down low !!!
 are appalling . weakest midfield ever . think we are 4 players short . 
don't care what abuse i get for this , but are shocking . words can't describe .
horrible manchester .
fuck this shit !!! jus fuck it man !! we cant even beat cardiff 
another rather rubbish performance today if i'm honest 
get in ! never cheered a cardiff goal before . well deserved . 
i just knew if we didnt get a 3rd goal that they could get an equaliser !! 
another goal lost at the last 5minutes . 
i'm sick of these average players wearing a united shirt . i don't blame moyes , but he needs to sorts big . 
cardiff city 2 manchester united 2
fuuccckkkk the last 4 minutes of this game 
 manchester city vs . tottenham
we've lost shit load of points this season on the same way ...

yawa will kill me one day
i really feel for moyes i've never seen a united squad of dim and lazy players 
really gutted with the way we played tonight . pathetic performance . thank you moyes for this . you've proven again u can't manage 
full time score : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united .

fellaini is the albatross around 's neck

why pass there ?!? 
disappointment , frustration . rooney should've scored that . totally sad . 
cardiff deserved something out of the game , man utd were generally poor . rooney was lucky not to have been sent off . 
omg i knew thats gonna happen 
that's fcuking twice this year them black bastards have let me down for a fortune .. absolutely useless mufc
someone won't sleep well this night . msschew ! 
manutd equal battyman side ah mean dem get chance fi go 4th in the table !!
need cleverly gone now , at least we drew an no loss well done mufc
cardiff are okay ! but united were too complacent . 
bad day . another 2 points wasted . 
no 4th position for manutd
manchester united can use useful midfielders . cleverly and fellani gotta go .
yuuuuup so we're not winning the title this season with this side worst prem team i've ever seen
david moyes manchester united team is consistent . consistently underwhelming .
both manchester clubs missing their captains badly 
another rather rubbish performance today if i'm honest 
ganyu yakoma . goal !!! 92 ' - cardiff 2-2 manchester united
fellaini , cleverley , evra and valencia should be walking back to manchester .

every reason to be pissed with that second half performance . should've scored a third & sealed it . 
why when thru on goal would you pass to danny welbeck ? the worst finisher think ive ever seen ! without carrick we look clueless

coupon buster utd . just get rid of the manchester part ! 
cardiff 2 - 2 man u final score . awful hoofball game . manchester united really not at there best .
i think all man utd fans should sign a petition imploring moyes to sign a top quality midfielder to play with carrick 
full-time : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
i think moyes is hopeless , fellani is also rubbish hopefully both will be gone soon 
perfundoj ndeshja : cardiff city 2:2 manchester united ' rooney & evra :/
its a draw gentleman . congrats for rooney , evra and manutd ! 2-2 its the best birthday gift ever . muuah . 
yah manchester united draw -_-
all supporters . take a moment to appreciate all what carrick has done for the team these past few years .
ft : cardiff 2 - 2 ( campbell 33 ', kim 90 ' ; rooney 15 ', evra 45 ' )
too many mediocre players in that manchester united squad . you don't deserve to be devils . you are not bad ass . 
one lapse from evra cost dear . not too many complaints about what was probably a fair result .
manchester united are fucking shit !

people have been laying into wazza all game , need to fucking lay off . 
what rubbish after going 2-1 up ! cardiff deserved a point 
free header from a free kick . school boy defending 
full time : cardiff city 2 manchester united 2 - kim bo-kyung scored a last minute equaliser for the south wales club .

dis manutd team no wan win league !
draw was the fair result ! very much a moyes type performance from mufc gritty determined but lacked any real guile & creativity 
seen it coming . poor defending from evra for the equaliser . cardiff deserved a draw at least . 
what a complete waste of money fellaini is , he is useless and cleverley doesn't cut it ... our midfield is shocking !

and the struggle continues 
cardiff have taken 4 points from both manchester clubs and the cardiff fans must be pleased with that
manchester united , how market ?
fergietime strikes back ! 
how did that happen ? 
mufc top 4 at end of season ? does not look very likely . mcfc look the real deal and will be hard to stop if their away from gets sorted .
nice to see rooney thank the ref for not sending him off !! 
hahahaha awesome !! glory hunters in your face . 
incredible last few minutes at vs , 1st bambi fails to seal it and then draw level .. it ends 2-2 !
2-2 is about right . utd poor enough . fellaini , valencia - muck . 
too defensive after we take the lead . 2nd half was shite . this is all too familiar this season 
2 points lost ... damn you moyes

didn't deserve the point today . another case of not good enough even with a big decision going our way . 
that was awful . back into the poor performances and woeful moyes tactics from 6 weeks ago . 
sigh . can’t believe just gave up another 90th minute goal . unacceptable .
manchester united nor wise , dey won enta fourth b4 , dey tell dem say their tym don reach 4 dat 1 ... lolzzzzzz
fucking nightmare 
having said that ... we should have took all three points with the chances we had 
ref was a tosser . 
so with a chance to move up into 5th manchester lets in a 90 ' min goal .. i cant deal with this team anymore
absolute shit ! well annoyed ! so easily should have won that game 😡 
and that's what happens when you try to sit on a 2-1 lead . not the way .

disappointing ! absolutely gutted . 2 points dropped !

deserved point for cardiff . we shouldn't have had rooney on the pitch for 85ish minutes .. go again against leverkusen . 
i can't believe manchester united and cardiff drew 2-2 .
end of the match cardiff city vs manchester united #2 -2
so manutd got nearly the same crisis as ac milan in italy . another draw for the red devils . late equaliser by kim . only rank 6 .

good game united

manchester united is the definition of failure ..... mcheew
basically , i've been waiting for 2 weeks to see this . fuck you all 
manutd never fail to disappoint 😡
i'm more looking forward to us selling off our shite players than seeing whoever we bring in . 
man of the match is rooney .. 
bad result tonight 
please buy gundogen moyes , midfield is awful 
frustrating . 
horrendous defending from evra again . honestly don't know what he's thinking sometimes . throws away his good work on our second 
evra has to be replaced . he's been good going forward but defensively poorly indeed . 
neither manchester club has won at cardiff !!
shite defending for free kick . why didn't rooney just shoot himself .. aaaaagggghhhhh 
wat a bad 2nd half 
inquest to be held at mufc ; referee to be reprimanded as to why a penalty wasn't given to claim another unjust win . 
still an important point for man utd in the mid-table scrap 
load of fucking bullshit !! 
ugh ffs 
manchester united . why ? :(
semangat vs kualitas ! nice game by cardiff city and manchester united ! 
absolutely fumingggggg ! evra knows he was in the wrong then , i love him too much to criticize but that should have been 3 points for mufc
back in title race ? loool 7 points away from top xd 
hard to believe manchester united let cardiff tie them right at the end .
full time : cardiff 2-2 manchester united . intense game with a healthy dose of poor defending .

awesome ... well at least we didn't lose to cardiff , unlike another manchester club ...
quality in the middle is needed . cleverley simply isn't good enough for this team . 
manchester united's focus this year : just try not to lose
you can complain about the re-taken freekick and the 2 late misses but that performance did not merit a win . fucking abysmal

fellaini must be the worst bit of business that manchester united have ever done ..
god poor defence from 
fair result in the end , midfielders needed 
3pts to 1 just like that smh should've had that one 
why is moyes even at manchester united ?

in the end disappointing ! broke an almost 10win streak !
mu bncong . look like a shit 
desmond a fair result really . united lacking the killer touch again . michael carrick's value to the team increases in his absence . 
tough outcome . terrible defense . missed chances . 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
lucky to get a draw really . hung on most the 2nd half and overall poor ! another negative performance . top 4 is really gonna be hard 
credit to cardiff . moyesie time .. reversal of fergie time currently . unbeaten run continues in frustrating fashion . 
fuck d moyes tactical .. damn .. even fans know u use d players wrongly .. haiiizzz .. it aint d same manchester i knew b4 ..
all you need is , shingi kagawa ...... ' s brother . 
eindstand : cardiff city - manchester united 2-2
i swear i can never back out of manutd but i will always hate david moyes no mata what
2-2 ft there no easy games , especially away from home , but just not good enough from !!
don't think i saw pass the ball to a player besides the centre backs
massive 2 points dropped there . failed to just see the final few minutes out . 
typical under moyes .... defensively woeful and severely lacking creativity . deserved the equaliser
lol like i said how long can this mufc team go
ft 2-2 thanx to asian boy kim ..: p
once again danny welbeck and tom cleverley play and we play shit . 
mufc after wining arsenal ' we are back in the title race ' can't wait to hear what they have to say ...... lol 
europa league welcomes manutd with open hands at the end of this season !
such crap of play by manchester united
he should have been sent off , scores and assist a goal and then he should have won the game , yep wayne rooney ... 2pts wasted 
manchester united drops points too super sunday :p :p :p
ft : manchester united 2-2 cardiff city
great result for cardiff ! kim doing what he does best ! scoring late goals against manchester !
ft cardiff 2-2 manchester united 6th in the league

final . cardiff 2-2 manchester united . 
manchester united is totally muschamping this season .
rooney was foolish not to have scored that goal 
fellaini isn't a united player , end of 
hahaha manchester united ! wat a useless club
manchester united 2 v 2 cardiff city
well that was shite . cleverly and fellaini is not a midfield 2 . tactically poor from moyes as well . 
manchester united lose more points
another 2 points dropped by man united . awful defending by for cardiff's equaliser on 90 minutes . 
not like rooney at all there ..... 
fulltime : cardiff 2-2 manchester united . another famous result for cardiff . a kim header in added time means both sides go away with a point
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united ( campbell 33 , kim 90 -rooney 15 , evra 45) .
full time mu 2 vs cardiff 2 glory manchester united . we love you : *

the manchester clubs come .. one leaves with fuck all and the other a point . see you next season ;)
fundermental of manutd !! our squad is shit only 2 wc players & many shit ones
this has been the most dispiriting performance since losing 4-1 to city . absolutely awful performance . leverkusen will be laughing .
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united .
moyes repeating mistakes . worrying . 100% his fault . 
hahahahahahahahahahahaha now those fans can shut the f$%# up
cardiff almost deserved to win that given the way manchester united's defense was playing
cardiff defo the better team today . 
rooney gifted em the point , i can take the point rather than defeat 
arsenal win . manchester united draw . . great week !
didn't even deserve a point but what the hell was rooney doing ?? " if that was van persie ".... 
2 points dropped . fuck sake ! respect for cardiff though , they played well . 
unsuccessful draw manchester united ((
liverpool drew + chelsea won + tottenham lost + manchester united drew . this weekend = sex . perfect .
full time : cardiff 2-2 manchester united goals [ campbell , kim , rooney , evra ]
ft : cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united 
its not the fact drew with cardiff its the manner in which they played .. which was very poor again ..
on this showing , i'd be happy if we get to 3rd or 4th . 
sad sad sad .... welbeck cleverly and fellaini . shameful
premier league results : manchester city 6-0 spurs and cardiff city 2-2 manchester city .
we were never at our best . its all abt taking ur chances . mad game .... not a bad point in the end . bring on leverkusen 
yes wales !!!!! 
rooney having a word with the ref about his report i'm sure 
take a moment and laugh at manchester united :d hahahahahahahah !!
ahh 2-2 manutd v cardiff 
i say this politely .... fuck ! 
well that was disappointing ! we could have been in the top 4 and leap frogged man city . ugh ! 
nuts nuts and more nuts and a few carrots issue off the ball with fellaini and then no focus should have defended better 
well played to cardiff .. it was a good match ! although not such a good result for us 
manchester united ngan cardiff city seri 2-2 full time
 oh my god rooney u had to shoot
ft cardiff city 2-2 manchester united * rooney 15 ' * campbell 33 ' * evra 45 ' * kim 90 '
it's another famous game at the cardiff city stadium they don't lose to the manchester teams what a game
still unbeaten one love
united poor today , fair result . fellaini was decent , cleverley wasn't 
never play fellaini again . never play fellaini again . 
 : ( english premier league ): cardiff city vs . manchester united . 2-2 . kim the korean from cardiff got the equalizer !
smalling gave away that win . all we had to do was not give away free kicks as that was the only way they would score . 
mufc got more than they deserve .
full time cardiff city 2-2 manchester united | bobo ganteng dadah~ roo for motm 
more points dropped for when leading first
people say liverpool spend money on shit players ... united is a team full of players not united quality ! young , fellani , nani etc 
 absolutely wasteful in front of goal today .
i cannot put into words how angry i am right now at 's performance .
if spurs lose 6 0 in manchester and i didn't see or hear it , does it still count ?
justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice 
as predicted . cardiff spoilt 's 3 points .
good point for united , considering how shit we played !! we seriously need some cm's!! 
manutd beat arsenal then draw to cardiff ... arsenal 4 points clear and manutd ??? 6th loooooool
both manchester teams couldn't bet us at our ground lol
never back a manchester united team as long as moyes is in charge 101
ooo the pains of being a supporter of the great manchester united . everyone wants our heads and glory
so united drew 2-2 with cardiff , whats happened to united ?? 
squander !! 
ft cardiff city 2-2 mufc
ft cardiff 2-2 man united rooney , evra , campbell , kim the scorers . fair result in the end . 4 points from manchester teams this season .
what a result for cardiff should of won but a point against manchester is not to be sniffed at . hahahahahahaha scumchester
same old s**t from 
we should be scoring late minute goals , not conceding . 
sad but most of us saw that coming ... 
fellaini wouldnt even get in hulls central midfield . which cost £5m .. think about that .. 
cardiff gained 4 points against manchester teams .
rooney complaining at the end even tho he should have been sent off ! brilliant ! 
this has to be the most agonisingly poor season i have endured . 
another mediocre performance . well played cardiff though . 
en route manchester to see the weeknd ahh so excited👏
they should be grateful for a point , their goalscorer should of been off , no question about it . 
well happy not in college tomorrow but in manchester instead
unluckyyy united still a point 
very disappointing 
hahahahah theres only one david moyes !!! 
shit game . fed up with . 
ft 2-2 
definitely didn't deserve 3 points , we missed carrick more than rvp ! 
why would anyone try and pass to welbeck when you can win the game yourself !!! 
midfield still needs sorting .... 2 managers , 8 years .... neither have sorted the issue . we can all see it . 
fergie time for cardiff . awesome header by kim . big middle finger to 
that cardiff equaliser was terribly inevitable . lucky to come away with a point , what we would give for a fully fit fletcher & carrick
final , cardiff 2-2 manchester united .
what was rooney doing ?! :/ 
sickening feeling in my stomach . 
manchester united draw 2-2 with cardiff city . important 2 points lost @ the 90th minute . are we missing sir alex or cristiano ronaldo ;-)
2 points droped by manutd oops
ft : 2-2 cardiff - 
that is manchester united's pl season finished ... time for them to concentrate on the cl but are they simply not up to scratch ? 
manutd on the log pls
shocking performance we were bloody awful . should have easily disposed of them . out midfield is bloody shite . time to drown sorrows . 
what a game ! 
fellani is manchester united worst buy ever ....
any other season i'd cheer for cardiff getting a point off manutd , but right now it won't make life an easier for . 
how can manchester united concede during fergie time ? no respect was shown 😦
 wins . ? 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united 
we are not a good team . just admit it cause i'm not wrong . we can make teams like cardiff and west brom look world class 
should have won . important points dropped 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united ( campbell ; kim - rooney ; evra ) thanks united ! 
disgraceful mufc .
very dissapointing tonight but lets be honest cardiff deserved a point tonight ! we will have to do things the hard way as usual . 
cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united . great game , couldn't have asked for much more when these two teams met . fav player kim scoring too ! 
 fuck fuck 2-2
2 points just thrown awayy !! disappointed ! ! 
 are you guys still there ?
what a mess , we shall still come top 
fellaini one of the worst signings in the making
cardiff ? 2-2 ? embarrassing ! our title hopes are now over ! :) goodnight all ! 
fucking joke !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
i cannot stand this fucking team at times . are you kidding me , have some hart . i feel sick . 
this could've been a vital vital 3 points !!!! but failed to seal thanks to welbeck & rooney in the very end !!! 
cardiff doesn't like both manchester clubs
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
smalling smalling . you never give away that cheap free kick at that area at such a time again kid . 2mainbola
bunch of losers in da team
united u cock-suckers 
yeeeeees fucking have that 
oh my 
awful awful embarrassing football from shocking result , fellaini needs to be shot and evra sold ! pathetic from set pieces !
 are the old 
only have themselves to blame . 
ft | cardiff 2 - 2 man . utd | need to work on the midfields ! , good game though 
unbefuckenlieveable ! 
well we cocked that up with the conceding the late goal and wellbeck and rooney missing those chances !!!! 
no robin no party .. 
lets just say goodbye to this year's trophy nd focus getting to the top four bcus with this players , i doubt !!! 
unlucky mufc
saw that coming . leaking too many late goals rather than killing off game . 
manchester united are nothing without van persie and carrick .
kim with a 90th minute header to give cardiff city a 2-2 draw against manchester united in cardiff city stadium 
honestly manutd didn't even deserve to win anyway . sloppy .
easily the worst game i've ever seen us play 
arrrhhhhh-so close to 4th ! cardiff deserved their point though ! 
manchester united = mediocrity ! only the big teams won this weekend .
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
ft :: cardiff 2-2 united . 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united is on the top of the league .
the way we played then we didn't even deserve 3 points ! shocking !?! 
cardiff city vs manchester united 2-2 full time
manchester united is so frustrating to watch .
unlucky to not get the win , onwards and upwards 
very very poor from lucky to walk away with a draw ... but serious re-enforcement's needed in january !! 
well played cardiff ! 
more points thrown away .. 
vety disappointing result in a very winable game . not wanting to apportion blame but international break did any favours !!
 drop points in fergie time . is this real life ? i don't even know .
i should've studied instead of watching the last 15 minutes of the game .... 
hahahah manchester united !!!! well done cardiff
let's all take a moment to appreciate how terrible manchester united are
neither manchester team picks up 3 points against cardiff in the first half of the season
manchester united why you make me crazy this morning ....
laughing at manchester united 😂
next match ucl | leverkusen v united | bay arena | kamis , 28/11/13 - 03.45 wita | 
absolutely horrendous . shite . fellaini an absolute waste of a buy . smalling too hesitant and slow . we've turned to last year's afc . 
i love how vulnerable manchester united are this year . you can tell they're not used to it either . can't win with their bench anymore
threw it away again . shocking in midfield again , cardiff deserved the draw . 
well that was disappointing . 
ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
the weakest side in prem history ? the one that won the league last year ?
good job manchester united 👍👏👏👏
another fucking draw ; ; need to be better no doubt about that !!
mau gak mau we got 1 point tonight-_- cardiff 1-1 united 
not happy about that ! bringing to many people through at once . january we should make that one signing and pull are fingers out 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united .... cardiff host league leaders arsenal next !
2 points dropped in my opinion . carrick's a massive miss . non existent midfield . no creativity . nothing new . unbeaten run continues . 
manchester united should really fire david moyes he thinks its everton no its manchester united david moyes should be fired
utd poor agen today . few chances to put the game away n wasted them all . need to uo our gama ! 
we long said that is a fool and an agent sent to destroy from within by liverpool . what a moron of a coach . 
as usual , welbeck just isnt quality . since he has no ability to finish , he's useless . rather have campbell than welbeck .
that kim guy rocked it jst in the face of smh , still a though
conceded equaliser in 91st minute but still had two great chances to win it thereafter ! what a time for their boy to score his first !
cardiff city drew 2-2 with manchester united after scoring a late equaliser ♥ kim bo-kyung mohabat hogai tere goal sey ♥ thankyou
omfg .... 2-2 on the 90th minute !? got to be kidding me ! d: so unlucky , can't believe we slipped up like that ... 
dissapointed with today but im still a manutd fan 
full time ! cardiff 2-2 manchester united thanks for united , the last watching the match in this year at semarang ..
we used to score late goals , now we concede late late goals 
shocking stuff . moyes won't last . 
what a depressing weekend of sport , with the draw topping it all off . * sigh * stop the train , i want to get off .
some disgusting football don't even know how they were winning that whole half 
gagal ke 4 besar : | hmmm noprob , always united ! 
sir alex left moyes with a sack of burning poo . 
 | cardiff ( 2-2 ) manchester united [ campbell 33 ', kim 90+ - rooney 14 ', evra 44 ' ] 
welbeck comes on we lose our lead . standard . to many poor players . cleverley brutal
really disappointed the way mufc defended in last 10 minutes . wish they become little bit concious about league position soon 
full-time : cardiff city 2 manchester united 2 .
cardiff against manchester 
stupid goal from a stupid free kick that had to be retaken after we bleww itt .... ahhhh ! 2-2 
deserved to win today . its pure bad luck . just one point nevertheless . 
ft cardiff 2-2 manchester united , 1 point
lack of concentration . we are going to regret losing these kinda points come may 
i tell you what , i'll be a very happy man if fellaini never pulls on a manchester united jersey again .
full-time : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united | nkttttt !!!!!
 have gone from attacking until the last second football to trying to see the game out for the last 10 !! this is not good enough now !
i can't believe rooney tried to set wellbeck up , he couldn't hit a fucking barn door . unfucking believable . 
hats off to cardiff , taken 4 point out of 6 against both manchester clubs
full time : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
ft : cardiff 2-2 manchester united 
holy f*** ! bad bad game !

i demand no more international breaks 
1 poin ☺ 
at the top of my christmas wish list : can david moyes ! 
it's easy to demystify btn champs and shuhiriras . na 
well ... southampton hangs on the 5th thanks to mufc for poor set play defending .
mufc lacks depth and quality
moyes needs to realise we are manchester united , we do not settle while 1 goal up away at a place like cardiff ...
ft : cardiff 2 -2 manchester united
good game united | manchester united ( 2 ) - ( 2 ) cardiff city (`-´)ψ

what is an manchester united ?
oooh manchester united eish !!
poor defending from manchester united and it has cost them 3points
stil on the bright side , least we didn't loose here like the other team from manchester did , city
oh god , here come the doom and gloomers cunts , just fuck off 
welbeck time is over .. he has been very poorly after the manchester derby .. please , moyes .. new signing !
fergie should've stayed managing man utd until he croaked and then man utd should've folded and sold their ground to fc united of manchester
full time : caldiff city 2:2 man utd 
outrageous !!! fuck you united , i'll neverforgov you for this !!! i hope all of you crash your team bus and die !!! 
why are we incapable of winning every time - gutting but getting used to it now 
what the heck was that 
that was 90 mins of painful viewing ... the only thing keeping me entertained was trying to work out who dressed vincent tan !.. 
well played cardiff ! you wanted to win this to be quite honest ! 
cardiff equalise in fergie time 
wayne fucking rooney . what were you thinking . shoot , you moron . 
getting pretty fed up with this now 
wayne what are you doing ? 
whereas mufc finished off team in the last 5 minutes under fergie , they now leak goals under moyes .
unbelievable . that last chance roo missed was too valuable , but we will keep our heads up and support the team . 
- that was a poor performance .
real madrid won yesterday . manchester united just tied . now lets hope the bears win👌⚽🏈
final : cardiff 2-2 manchester united .
too much pressure made us lost the match !?! 
ft : manchester united 2 - 2 cardiff city
two points dropped . 
hahaha this team from manchester is shit .
im mostly frustrated with welbeck - ive lost count of how many great chances he misses in games at key moments . not good enough . 
this is what arsenal and liverpool have done for years beat a title rival then drop points against a much lesser side 
smalling a full back . rooney , big players win matches ! 
manchester united is now unbeaten in the last 10 games . !
one step forward two steps back . 
again i repeat ...... champions my foot !!! 
horrible 
4 points from both manchester teams ! would of never expected that !
wasted chance today ..... gutted 
seriously . seriously ?! 
haha manchester united !!!!
moyes has successfully turned manutd into a mid table team 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
mufc * sadd ? !!!! rooney could jus finish it ... he had to pass ☹
like i said mufc lose or draw ........ mufc fans ntoi !!
ft 2-2 , big opportunity issues to go 4th just 1 behind liverpool and chelsea ! oh well we move on to spurs next week ! 
manutd why now , why ?
manchester united you played just suck suck suck . no where near the united who were champions . kiss your title goodbye lah .
cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united ..... what a contest !!!!!!
bollocks 
what a shitty fuckin draw ... still continues to disappoint in the 
david moyes has always looked like a caretaker manager
( ft ) cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
time for these players to move on from united . too much dead weight about . they've had enough chances . 
manutd 21points 6th , if man utd won would be standing top 4th .
that was sore as fuck !! 
oops manchester united . 2-2 😂
:/ dropped points . 
seriously awful awful performance 
the lack of effort and passion fellaini has is unacceptable . got battered by a guy half his size all game
that second goal by cardiff city was coming tbh . 
second time the opponent scores the equalizer in the 90th minute . bad result , but the title race is definitely not over . 
we just got a point off manchester united omg !!!
united just dropped two fuckin points to , this is not the time to drop points at all .... wtf 
i don't believe . the one time i want manchester utd to win a match and they blow it . hard not to take that personally .
sorry but u r not up to mark .. cant understand the basis of your selection ? please answer 
no complains cardiff deserve it .. manutd didnt get to hold the ball .. no real intent on each passes
 manchester united is no longer a first class team but a truly bullshit ass team .
it could be worse . you could be a fan . 
how is fellaini in a united shirt 
 were painful to watch today . 
if you didn't watch football before you would believe cardiff was the mid-table team not manchester united
 moyes tactics awful . sat back at 2-1 to see out last 10 mins .
ft : cardiff 2-2 manutd reactions ? 
god bless cardiff , smiling at the top seven points above united . . table toppers
an excellent point for the bluebirds as they come from behind twice to take a share of the spoils . kim bo the hero ! 2-2 
if i die , write this on my grave-stone ' rather here than watch united play 4-4-2 ' 
hehehe ! watching manchester united struggle is my porn
watch these arsenal fans get excited ! that defeat against mufc still hurting 😂
cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
today was definitely 2 points dropped rather than 1 point gained though . 
fellaini was utterly shite yet again ! 
why does united stop playing football when their 1 ahead ? been that way all season . very lucky arsenal didn't get back last match 
another sad day to be a manutd fan ! 
credits to cardiff . too bad for manutd , they have themselves to blame for not being clinical .
2points dropped in injury time at cardiff . not good 
 worst signing ever . shit bebe atleast wanted to play when he got the chance . 
this is goin to be one long season 
2 points gone :/ 
full time : 2-2 
draw fair result didnt deserve to win usual awful performance as per this season 
under fergie we scored last minute goals , under moyes we concede them ... 
tetep glory glory man united | ft : cardiff 2 - 2 man united will never die
conceding that late equaliser was karmic justice for that bloody awful " come on david moyes " chant 
manchester united go 6th
amongst all the hysteria i failed to notice that we're now only a point behind manchester united .
7point clear off manchester united
shit la ... i swear i won't watch runningman for 2week lol 
fulltime : cardiff 2-2 manchester united
not winning away is terrible especially against teams you know you should smash 
all i will say to fans is don't be upset , karma is a fucking bitch lol
final : cardiff 2-2 manchester united . rooney con gol y asistencia . 
i love manchester united ! van persie should come and save them now
rooney should have been sent off . we have no midfield or organisation , story of our season really . well played cardiff though ! 
good job manchester united 😄
well done to the lads .... at least we got a point out if the match .
what a wank performance !!! 
i guess i will take the tie .

worst performance all season : full time 2-2 cardiff city
well that was intensely disappointing 
we are shite , massive improvement needed 
would've taken a loss instead , way sub-standard without nani , kagawa , carrick , robin .. not that we are world class with them . awful . 
poor performance can't say a lot more than that !! go again next week

manchester lucky to have drawn united !

( ft ) cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
second time this season man united have conceded a header in last minute whilst we're winning , need a new centre back 
 were not hungry enough , ought to stop their wages for a few weeks all that money to play like this , it's not good enough
 ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united ( campbell 33 ', kim 90+1 ' ) ( rooney 15 ', evra 45 ' ) 
well that's a disappointing end . at least they didn't completely blow it , guess 1 point isn't too bad 
in other news ... the new ordinary part of manchester just disappointed their fans again .. 
what is the point of danny welbeck ?? 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united ( rooney ' 15 , evra ' 44 - campbell ' 33 , kim ' 90 )
no complaints over result . we were poor . we're an average team at best . fellaini woeful once again ! 
am pained ehn !!! bloody cunts !! 
ft : united 2 - 2 cardiff . those 2 chances at the end were the ones that we should have taken . didn't play well enough to win . 
that's it . done . 
ft| cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
something about manchester united messing things up that brings utter serenity , peace and promise to my life 
worst sunday !! 
well that's shows the amount of quality manchester united have in defence absolutely none .
yeses manchester united i don't knw what's its problm fuck .
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united .
 absolutely embarrassing . how much are some of these tubes getting paid ? well done cardiff . much as it pains me .
manchester united is falling apart game by game wtf
moyes love story with manchester united continues !.......
untied really are poor , cheers for that cardiff , manchester wank wank wank
ft cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
we are still unbeaten :) 
i'm completely just disappointed in manchester united ..
still believe ..... 
full time manchester united 2 cardiff city 2
love a sideways pass in the 94th minute when you're trying to win a game ! just love it ! 
shit result , shit performance . fellaini is a liability . 
david moyes ' team selection is dreadful . i don't see what he's trying to do with united ... he looks out of his depth 
that midfield needs sorting out 
well done cardiff . deserved point . united utter shite . just highlights the need more each week for a world class cm 
smh .. .. could take the chance ..
kudos to cardiff they matched toe to toe , not good enough from us 
gimme a baseball bat & i'll smash my tv ! why do we fucking concede so late ! rooney missing that one at the end ! unbelievable ! 
mind you , watching manchester united play in blue and cardiff play in red is a massive middle finger to proper football .
what a disappointment ... two points thrown away , poor ref all round . needless freekick given away , then a simple tap-in squandered 
further prove of how important michael carrick is to manchester united . midfield without him non existent . cleverley is fucking horrific .
 2-2 . haha . great job by the home side . you deserved that ...
we are just average premier league side now that's the harsh truth 
cardiff should have had all 3 points . shocking performance by seems to be standard now though :/
definitely got to go manchester christmas markets this year
2-2 lol mufc ballas :/
more points dropped we can't afford any more , need win after win for the rest of the year for a realistic chance of the title 
not a good result . but , 10match tanpa terkalahkan . lets get another match with 3point ! 
their shinji atleast made an appearance . :( 
poor today , didn't deserve to win . would have been a win if we had everyone fit 
didn’t deserve to win today tbh . not enough creativity within the team . international break definitely affected our resurgence 
i have a hunch . manchester united is going to have a rough season this year . 
we need to change something in jan ... no quality in the mid . afro man does not deserve to start any games with his current form 
cardiff tied the score 2-2 at the 90minute mark & ended the match against manchester united in a tie .
shaktar , southampton and cardiff . - throwing away leads . 
 very lucky to draw & only themselves to blame . rooney & felliani should have been subbed at halftime , why take off the goal poacher
just dumbness by mufc . why couldn't they just finish of the game
sad end . can't lose such crucial points . 
not good enough , drawing to a team like that is absolutely ridiculous . 
manchester united are absolutely rubbish ! 
which one was worse , rooney or allen ? 
just can't squeeze into the top 4 
cardiff deserved the point sick of saying the performance from the players is simply not good enough 
saints still at #4 ! more like manchester u-losers ! hehehehe ! 
i'm disappointed , very disappointed with this performance

it's so funny how cardiff has managed to gain points at both manchester united and city

 bad days
another late goal .

draw , still better than lose 
well i'm off for " more than " a few beers !!..

poor performance , poor game and poor refereeing today 
unbelievable manchester united !!!!!! david moyes just f *** off
united just haven't got it anymore , no fear factor , no killer instinct , no difference maker and no fergie 
we lost 2 precious points today . extremely disappointed ... :-( 
one thing for sure , sir alex with good old manchester united wouldnt sit back and relax with just 1 goal diff lead 
i love the positive fans , great supporters ! thats 10 games unbeaten in all competitions for

real drama today , cardif 2 , manutd 2 , i am john champion n jim berglin 
didn't deserve anything ! cleverley not good enough to wear the red of barnsley let alone manchester united !
how many points have manchester united dropped this season to midtable sides ?!
best believe i got money on manutd to win the treble this season .
 now a team which defends narrow leads and concedes late goals . that's going to be the reality for the foreseeable future
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united 
at this rate i’ll be happy with a top 10 finish - . - 
get your fucking act together , moyes ! this is fucking retarded ! 
rubbish performance . 
feels like a defeat :( 
4 points from the two manchester clubs ? 
should be a quiet night on twitter then ...

 my voice is hurting now i'm screaming at the tv
cardiff derserved the draw manchester united can afford to be dropping points like that .
probably cause he's a manchester player .
david moyes is the biggest joke at manchester since chicharito .
i can't see manchester united winning anything this season . 
at least we never lost 6-0 ! 
manutd emoooo sia . cardiff played well though , good for them !
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united . a really entertaining match . cardiff city played extremely well . 
zero complaints , cardiff deserved all three points in fact .

not a good day for me ! 
2 different lucks for manchester ..
fellinie u ball bag 
just not good enough !! not enough class in the utd squad !! simple as that ! 
dont tell me finished with 2-2 
thats 3 points against city and a point against manu . sit down , manchester . 
so bloody frustrating . rooney should have won it at the end . but .... yasudahlah 
manutd tho
entering the mid-stage of the season manchester united are sandwiched between southampton and everton ...
welbeck , cleverley , ferdinand and evra are all shit and deserve to go 
good game manchester united
well that's annoyed me a large amount 
knew that was coming the moment welbeck spooned that chance . consistently disappoints when needed . 
going to be a long few weeks with no carrick ! 
i bet all of our moyes and fellaini hating fans are pleased about the result anyway ... still a long way to go 
what the actual fuck was rooney doing at the end there ? sums up the whole game ! load of shit ! 
 : ft results : cardiff 2-2 man united ; kim's goal gives cardiff a dream 1point as they remain unbeaten to manchester teams at home .
ft cardiff 2-2 we got what we deserved no more than a draw . i always new we'd concede a late goal the longer it went at 2-1 
fucking brutal we are ! so so poor . no quality going forward at all . 4 or 5 need brought in january . 
 again drop points in the last minutes
ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
lmao ........ so manutd dint win
during sir alex era , we use to score late goals but now in moyes era , we're conceding late goals .. i don't where are we going from here ? 
well if rooney was meant to be sent off medal should be off and done for assault . ridiculous . 
im being dead serious we need at least 3 new midfielders . a whole new midfield preferably . 
our midfield is shit 
meanwhile ... ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
possession was 50/50 against cardiff . shows the lack of quality of players like fellaini , cleverly . 
got exactly what we deserved . we were average at best !! 
what a disappointing performance !!! 
ccfc2v2mufc 
i really wanted 7 ffs 😂 
 defense was terrible
deserved nothing more than that draw fucking shocking performance from the midfield 
i've seen better 10-match unbeaten runs than this one from manchester united .
what a day 
* face palm * manchester united , you just had one job to do . 
united didn't win because they didn't have bacuna to score a brilliant free kick like he did for us against cardiff 
when your rivals put 6 past spurs , that is exactly how you should respond 
well manchester united fucked up my weekend
and manutd couldn't even win cardiff ! 
we stole a point today 
good game by cardiff , bad game by united , simple as that 
can hav no complaints . defended really well all game as well . with a depleted squad available , that is a decent point 
never seen such a poor manchester united midfield ... devoid of absolutely everything ! and why rooney isn't just slotting that in i don't know
haha manchester united
 hahahaha mid table pricks
 gave away possession too easily too many times .
having to get a bus from walden to manchester victoria 😐🔫
dropping points again , sigh . bad performance . moyes is back to his old habits once again ! 
another shocking mufc performance ! got what they deserved and they were lucky to get that ! fed up with the shit football !!!
at least we're in the europa league places 
injury time is having its way with me today 
isn't moyes really perfecting the pissed off look fergie look . must be a scottish thing ! 
cardiff are a force to be reckoned with . 
what a match . should be win . respect for cardiff and their fans ! shocking atmosphere . 2-2 . we'll bounce back ! 
manchester city won 6-0 against spurs , while manchester united drew 2-2 against cardiff .

valuable points dropped not good enough 😡 
it's just painfull to watch , 
disappointed but a point is better than nothing draw
forget makes 2 records 9 consecutive wins and 13wins 12013
full time , it finishes 2-2 with a late late late goal from cardiff , manutd remain in 6th
great comeback from . to level the score 2-2 . have work to do ! 3 points would definitely have made the prem more exciting . 
i really cant express how much i hate manchester united 
you can only win so much matches that you really don't deserve to win 
scruffy welsh dings cardiff city worst footballing team in england

manchester urinated fans are livid
beat man city ... just drew with this other manchester team . i like this team .
brilliant ! never gave up , must say they deserved a point . 
words cant comprehend what im feeling right now 
why does martin tyler have to get a sly comment in about us !? what's cardiff v united got to do with manchester city 
very poor performance , could see that equaliser coming a mile away .... sat too far back again 
fellaini is so disappointing in midfield 
who the fuck are manchester united ?
football is shit . sometime hate it so much . why do i waste and hour and a half to watch play like that . grrr !! rant over now ! haha :) x
 final : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united .
it can't be .. sir alex ferguson leaves .. we cant beat cardiff city ... manchester united will never win the title if they don't act fast ...
no one can deny that the two manchester clubs always produce a good football match , week in week out
w e l b e c k , just release him . 
another points is missing . :( 
we have the worst back four currently in the premier league . do something ! 
manchester united draw 2-2 with cardiff city . important 2 points lost @ the 90th minute . are we missing sir alex or cristiano ronaldo ? ;-)
spurs , liverpool , manutd = perfect weekend !!!!
what did the optimist say when he wanted to jump from the top of a building ?? " so far so good " # mufc
no more then the welsh deserved . slow and laboured from mufc . difficult watching
lol cardiff did some esque there 
cardiff played well and deserved a point but we still should've won the game . midfield still not good enough . referee was awful . 
manchester united should not come away with anything less than 3 points at 2-1 up with 5 minutes to go . thats farcical .
disgusted 
cleverly just didn't offer anything today , don't see why anderson doesn't get a look in 
wasted 2 points :( :( 
manchester is clearly blue today !
get that cheque book out moyes ... 
thank you manchester united ( y )
well done 
manchester united 😫
crise no mufc
unbelievable result ! great point against manchester united !!! so happy !!

ugh what's up with yee lads 😔
ffs . that's the weekend ruined . .
pure class from ryan giggs & to think he's almost 40 . legend 
sitting back on a one goal lead . don't they ever learn ? 
seriously need to strengthen the midfield . missed carrick loads today ! 
poor 
fucking lol 
i like it when manchester united performs dismally . a useless draw .
where is our fucking midfield this season ????? 
disappointed but cardiff deserved a point if i'm honest united were very poor 
injuries or not , we should not be dropping points against teams like cardiff 
cleverley . shocking . if that's the future then the future is looking grim . 
yet another manchester scalp claimed by cardiff city
that's 4 points dropped in the final minutes of the game . southampton and now cardiff . both games , we've gone negative when leading . 
moyes is just too negative for my liking 
another disappointing performance . how welbeck and rooney didn't score at the end is beyond me . 
pish ! 
manchester united in second place on the table provided you add their points and goal difference ...
united bottled it at the back and up front at the end . lacklustre performance and lucky to finish with eleven . 
easily the worst midfield ever . moyes has made us even more average . hanging on again . 
full time : manchester united 2 cardiff city 2 ( rooney 15 , evra 45 ) ( campbell 33 , bo-kyung 90 )

bad times to be a manutd fan
fuck sake what a difference 2 points would have made right at the last minute :(
i like it when manchester united performs dismally .

rooney pressed l1+r1+x 
david moyes tactics and substitutions are terrible 
full-time : cardiff 2-2 manchester united
fulltime : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
a managers job is to be able to make the right changes in a tight game . separates the greats from the bums 
lol at manchester united
can't believe rooney didn't shoot tho all he had to do was slide it in 😩😩 it's so obvious how badly we need new midfielders !! 
manchester united owned hahahahaaha comeback kings , who !?
people keep talking about how fellaini will come good… i don’t see it happening :/ 
fucking unbelievable ! fuck noes why rooney didn't shoot . so fucking pissed off ! 
bring on mid week ! mufc ok !
full time : cardiff city vs manchester united 2 - 2 ( campbell 33 ', kim 90+1 ) ( rooney 15 ', evra 45 ' ) > =) > =)
who the fuck is kim bo-kyung ? 
sighs ... mixed season 
great result great game , good enough united next game play better mate ! 
 pain and suffering is a music to my ear ;p
death of manchester is alive and well 
full-time . 2-2 . sonofabitch . 
i rarely criticize cleverley but today , it was like " oh lord , take him off " 
 cadiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
disappointing but fair result . we never played well enough to beat them . we really need to play better with the cl & spuds to come . 
was hoping to win this game , wat happened manchester united ? 😞
oh damn ! -_- ft : cardif vs united = imbang 2 
a friend made a bet that and will win today and paid 100 fr . he would have won 219 fr . but then made it 2:2 in 90 '.
i even prayed 4 manchester united . this is fuckry
manchester united 😄 ... somebody comfort my bro cause he might kill himself here . i can't help but laugh
how tom cleverly plays professional football full stop , never mind for a club the size of manchester united is beyond me ! 
so much will be said about rooney being lucky , yet nothing will be said about fellaini getting slapped . poor today . 
another piss poor performance from yet again struggling to find excuses for our poor season
late goals have cost us dearly this season switching off before the jobs done is criminal , we should know better 
full time : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united ..
manchester united - cardiff 2-2 ! shit man !
so the 2 manchester teams couldn't beat these guy at their home .
ft : cardiff 2-2 manchester united
we had 2 good chances to win the game when it went 2-2 
manutd so outta form
 ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united ( campbell 33 ', kim 90+1 ' ) ( rooney 15 ', evra 45 ' ) 
manchester united senin amk
useless cunts just cost me 85 quid 
ft 2-2 . horrible shit . we miss you top 4 , carrick , jones , rvp . all those guys ! 
i'm not surprised . not at all . can't defend . midfield terrible . no final third . fellaini ??? get out of it ! 
oh ! & cardiff city were having manchester united ... making a serious statement , 1st city now united ... underdogs ? ...
i remember when we used to focus on winning runs , not on games unbeaten . you don't advance as a club when not losing is celebrated 
ft 2-2 failure to see out a match costs united again .
 cardiff city 2-2 manchester united . some justification .
good game united ! still belive manchester united !!! 
haha . who wants to laugh at manchester united ? join me
take heart fans
georgia southern and akron manchester who needs to pass to win ?
you realise you are fucked up if your super sabs are welback and giggs 
being honest our overall team is crap , we have an ageing back four , cleverly and fellani , smalling shouldn't even be at the club . 
 2-2 oh for f*ck's sake ...
yest's results mean for shit now . we could have gone 4th . now fked it up with tot n everton next . 
i can't even understand why rooney didn't finish ! what the fuck is going on !!! fuming !! absolutely fuming !!
 2-2 oh for f*ck's sake ...
manchester united loser !
did we deserve to win ? no . we had a good run of games . but the lack of consistency of our players has been just too glaring . 
a draw is probably a fair result , united are awful this season 
horrible run of fixtures to put that right . leverkusen , tottenham and everton . time to stand up and be counted . 
carddifff cardiff ! ugh it's nt like they are barca or rm ! manchester united are supposed to have that scoreline against better teams ! 
manchester united draw againn- . -
 top 4 1 arsenal 28pts 2 liverpool 24pts 3 chelsea 24pts 4 manchester city 22pts
frustrating throwing lead away so . late ! didn't deserve the win though 
poor performance . fellaini and cleverley are not good enough ! gutted we spent so much on fellaini . we need some more class in midfield 
full time at cardiff city stadium : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
where have people come out of with the " mufc lucky to get a point " angle ? cardiff lucky to get a point . de gea had hardly a save to make ...
ft : cardiff 2-2 manchester united
fully deserved by cardiff ! too many chances missed again !! 
chaiii ... and the heart attacks they are giving me these days
fuck cleverley & smalling ! definitely not manchester united players ! welbeck still plays like a talented 14 year old far from mature !
how about that manutd :d
manchester united 😳😤
ft . 2-2 
manchester united yet again playing like chumps not champions ! 
is it me or have we started to zonal mark ? i hate zonal marking , it is absolute shite 
what was rooney thinking ?? hit that !!! 
manchester united under david moyes =just another liverpool☹ ..
well played come on miss a few sitters , standard danny w losing points on his own ! 
the positive thing is ... we're still unbeaten in the last 10 matches in all competition ... 
ft cardiff city 2-2 manchester united fc . ( campbell 33 ', kim 90+1 '; rooney 15 ', evra 45') . 
the us economy is stronger than our midfield . 
disgusting man u performance . januzaj and fellaini would not be in a saf starting 11 . shocking midfield . lucky to get a point . 
if you can't support us when we lost , don't support us when we win ! 
i wanted manchester united to win , but the korean guy scored so it's ok
slap a guy round the face , get your free kick again - seems fair . lazy lazy defending again though . 
i hate manchester united .
and mufc don't make the goal count and draw(bad as hell )
cleverly was shit today , fellaini can't control the midfield , if we don't sign a proper centre mid in january we won't win anything 
masa penuh : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united 32 ' fraizer campbell 90 ' bo kyung kim 15 ' wayne rooney 45 ' patrice evra
disappointing play by manchester united . so many chances down the drain just like that
full-time : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
manchester united have let me down another bet 😒
nowhere near enough to warrant a win 
a draw ! eish almost nuh ! 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
so were 7 points head of manchester united 4 ahead of liverpool and chelsea and 6 ahead of city and 8 ahead of the foys
some big games coming up and we're losing points carelessly !: ( next week : away at spurs 
cardiff out-manchester united'd manchester united .
manchester united .. unbeliveable
howard webb officiated the wrong manchester related fixture !
man u without persie is like iniesta without barca ! :( 
threw away another victory . my beloved united what is going on ? take nothing away from cardiff , they deserved a point . 
haha mufc smh
you'd have said would want four points from cardiff/tottenham away , minimum . now a win at white hart lane imperative .
that was once again disappointing from ... not effective at the front or back . 2-2 ft vs cardiff .
manchester united really frustrate me ... 
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united . a late equaliser in wales leaves both teams with a point each .
glory glory manchester united
seriously . fucking rubbish . 
even viagra can't get manchester united up
its feels like we lost #2 -2 
final . cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united .
 . golden eaglet coach manu garba is still a better coach than 
manchester united really suck now , i can't believe what i just saw
justice done for cardiff tbh , united are not what they used to be ! 
as if jamies been manchester markets without his sister nah
i don't rate manutd at all anymore .... not the same since fergie left !!
still a better result than manchester city v cardiff city : v
fair result . cardiff never deserved to lose that and rooney shouldn't have been on the pitch 
looks like man utd will be going into new year not even top 4 . slip ups when its easier to win than otherwise . wow ! is the team .
proper fell in love with this boy at the weeknd lastnight in manchester and i won't see him again :( ever
it's always a good weekend when united don't win hahaha
cardiff have taken four points from the manchester clubs this season . deserves nothing but 
hahahahahaha 
ft : cardiff 2-2 manchester united - united's draw extend their unbeaten run to 10 !! but unfortunate not to nick it at the end !!
ft ' manchester united 2-2 cardiff
and are back in contention for a mid table finish .. showing consistency of his evertonian days !!!
 lol ... though they haven't lost in the recent games .. but they do need to win games against minnows .. again ... lol
final | cardiff 2 ( campbell-kim ) - manchester united 2 ( rooney-evra ) 
so frustrating 
manchester city are the only team with city in their name in the top half of the table . this is probably not an important stat .
 stupid . u better out from 
good for me , i love and feel the pain that hard when i am playing ! cardif city 2 manchester united 2 . fulltime !
i knew park ji-sung would come back to haunt us ! 
well done cardiff 4 points away from lfc , 7 points away from mufc 
manchester untied fans surely can't still think they got any chance of winning the league 
so annoying 
ft : cardiff 2-2 manchester united ! keep vidic and evans as centre back partners ! no clean sheets away is crap . 
i can't wait to start reading some silly tweets 
so manchester united tied with cardiff city huh ?
 : manchester city-tottenham 6-0 , cardiff city-manchester united 2-2
another disappointing result 
the worst man united side of all time ! very lethargic ! 
these relegation-prone teams ndio dawa ya manchester ! kina leicester , crystal palace , swansea and now cardiff
manutd disappointed . better sleep . goodnight :)
what is the point of fellaini ? need to get this midfield sorted . 
: worst sunday !! 
the tactical changes by moyes show he's still got that mid-table mentality . we'll be ruing those games come may . utterly disappointed . 
only a team like manutd would draw against cardiff city lool😂😂😂
great performance against arsenal and then awful today , where's the consistency ? 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
frustrating !! mufc
where is this team's killer instinct ? 
poor performance 
 is blue united is shit !!!! 
manchester united cyah win prem league
 ughhhhhhhhh
cardiff deserved a draw in the cold light of day but still feels like 2points lost after being so close 
yes cardiff ! 
well done to they deserved that . happy for frazier campbell aswell . but that was pathetic , big changes needed in january .
that was pants 
another shocking performance from . but hey , that clown will come out and say it was a good performance . overhaul 1st team
we are awful , it's a joke . 2 easy points lost ! 
that was our chance to go 4th but man united just blew it i feel so disappointed 
that's another two points dropped !!! the only thing more shocking is the fact that cleverly still makes the team ! 
siot ar cakip nieyhh ! xpe2 keep calm n support manchester united ;)
manutd be singing started from the top now we here .
you really think rvp would try lay off an opportunity like that in the 93rd minute . would bury it himself . 
ft | cardiff city ( campbell 33 ', kim 90+1 ' ) 2 - 2 ( rooney 15 ', evra 45 ' ) manchester united bad game ! bad result ...! # believe
still support and love 
roll on transfer window !! 
fuckety fuck ... another killerblow . 
feels like a defeat :( 
cardiff really love manchester clubs !
if manchester united should lose a match ... that's it for them this season .
fa need todo something bout the level of referees in this country .... never a foul for the cardiff goal ... cost us 2 points .. 
can't . drop . points 
arghhhh bastardssssssssssss finished a draw , fucking shite ! 
ora popo tetep glory-glory manchester united ! 
ft : cardiff 2~2 manchester united 
we'll pay for these poor performances and dropped points come april may time . need a technical mid 
can man united fans admit tom cleverly is proper shit and an embarrassment to red shirt . time to remove the tinted glasses . 
 still 7pts up against manchester united .
manchester united 2 - 2 cardiff ft
the result serves moyesy right . negative tactics with a one goal lead are insulting everything manchester united's football stand for .
manchester united wtf
too much pressure and we draw the match .. 
cardiff city aka manchester killers
this year are a fucking joke !! moyes is cunt . a draw to a team that are 15th . 
david moyes and ed woodward have work to do in january 
 v ( pc ) ryan giggs #11 should have started match .
i remember back in the day when manchester united turned up for games . those were good days . look like they couldn't be arsed now .
david moyes is by far my favourite manchester united manager ever i mean what a guy he is
bye bye championship , buy buy europe ! just not good enough 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
absolutely love united in a bit of turmoil ! 
its okay we'll hammer spurs next week instead 
atleast they didn't beat us ey ! unlike the other manchester team
we will never be the same team again . 
what the hell .. how is it possible that manchester united didn't absolutely smash cardiff ?!
we don't need to spend big , just play youngsters who can pass the ball and tackle and keep possession ! that's a massive improvement 
manchester united is always my concern .. no matter where are they . i don't want to see them win unless if other team is catching arsenal
i think we need to sign some good players whilst we still have one or two still wanting to play for us in the current squad . 
evra gave us the lead but also let kim in for the equaliser . poor football from united today . still early days though 
we are a joke ! 
cardiff 2-2 man united 
is that manchester united looking sexy in 6th ;)
that 3points was supposed to take mufc to #4 on the table
shaky performance from the lads 
gutted !.. should have had that in the bag ! ⚽️
i have cherry jim beam . an annoying mufc result is something i can easily drink away
rearrange as necessary : well done the blue-reds against the red-blues 
ft ! cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
credit to cardiff for fighting to get the draw but booing giggs ? 
spurs were poor today but if we play like today we getting pumped 
we have quite a lot of work to do before santa comes . 
disappointing result .. rooney should hav scored in the stoppage time 
fuck it 
david moyes you mother fucker !! bring back fergie ..  
fair play , cardiff played well . as long as we stay in touch with chelsea and city , we're right in the race still . 
it worked by me supporting the scum today ha ! f**k off u scum !! hope u get relegated on ur way down that table !! 
not a good performance at all . we're lucky we came away with just a draw 
cardiff have gotten 4 points out of 6 vs the manchester teams .
haha . retweet if ur laughing at 
what absolute rubbish ! if moyes doesn't sign any players in january he needs to get out ! 
rooney the protagonist . fellaini 27 mil well wasted . 
ft cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
cleverly should never play another game mufc
sad result ! but well played \m/ woohoo ! we are still the best ! 20 20 20 can u beat that ? ;) in your dreams !! cheers my :d
ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united . 
spuds and manutd dropping valuable points .. a sunday can't be any better ...
we couldn't keep the ball for longer than 2min . zero ball retention !! 
from scoring late dramatic goals to conceding them 
can anyone recommend a good dog sitter/walker in the south manchester area ? me ( and my pug ) are in moss side .
ft : cardif city 2-2 manchester united 
when a 40 year old is your best midfielder , shit needs to change 
manutd fans where are u alll ahahahah
ft : mufc 2 - 2 cardiff :(( good game united :(( we need ferguson !!! ( again )
ahh , extra time goal from cardiff to make it 2-2 . should of squeezed a win but a point is better than ba loss 
what the fuck was rooney doing ? 
nothing is slower than fellaini 
but cardiff deɛɛ , team papa paaa oo . you be manchester united , and so what ??
win lose or draw man united till i die !! * enough said 
never have i been so sure that we'd concede an equaliser , some really shit performances today , disappointing after the arsenal match ! 
really poor at the end there from utd but got what they deserved 
every time i think where getting going we do that .. frustrating 
where's the old manchester united ??
i don't why manchester united family fail to realise that david moyes is not worthy of this club .
a draw vs cardiff is a fair result tbh as should have been sent off in the first 10mins , then went on to score and set one up ! 
terrible sporting weekend - , awful . , awful . it can only get better , right ?
hahahaha fuck you manchester united ! 
fellaini needs to go . sorry but get the fuck out of manchester you sorry piece of shit .
im glad that final chance has exposed rooney for what he is , overpaid , over appreciated , over cuntish and a complete judas to mufc
tie ! well ! this is something what we mufc fans can't handle !
neither manchester teams have been able to breach fortress cardiff 
no words for what rooney did in the last minute ! what was that ?! just bury the thing !!! 
dont blame moyes . he knows what he's doing . have faith 
and we had to concede in ft 
final | cardiff city 2 ( campbell y kim ) - manchester united 2 ( rooney y evra) . 
at the end of the season , we will win the war 
final : cardiff 2-2 manchester united . rooney con gol y asistencia . 
if i never have to see welbeck , cleverly , fellaini again , it will be too soon 
thanks for ruining my day off , manchester united .
 shouldn't make jest of manutd too much ... our next epl match is an away game to the same cardiff city .
cardiff city tied against manchester united . lolool
haha shame you scum cunts😂 
another stella performance from .
a well deserved point for cardiff . what a performance . we got ourselves to blame as a ball club . 
 love it !!! 
that big belgian strolls about the pitch !! done fuck all since he signed !! 
well it sucks that cardiff scored at 90 " and manchester didn't win :(
lol , manchester utd seems to be fucking up real bad
manchester united please mind the gap !!!!!
you wanna park the bus ? bring on giggs :) 
can we get in the top 4 already .... shu ha xd !?! 
robson , ince , keane , scholes , now we have fellaini and cleverly . worst midfield have ever had .
thts the weekend screwed up .. 
 
manchester united brings me too much stress ...
wasted so many chances . could’ve been 3 , 4 goals for united . tough luck 😫
not good enough to win that match . 
so cardiff managed to secure a point against manutd . hard luck to united fans . 
last min goals have taken away points from us this term ... sigh .. 
misses chance go to fourth place 
debating whether or not fellaini is worse than djemba-djemba . after today i'd say yes 
what a strange thing for martin tyler to say . " at least mufc can say they got 1 more point than mcfc at cardiff "
come on united fucking had that then and let it slip come on can't be fucking about like that anymore 
thank you manchester , been a good weekend !
god are average . easily the worst united side i've ever seen .
we have lost another 2 points that we gave away in the last minutes of the game . why do we keep doing this ? 
just bad bad defending ! and is just not working for us ! 
full-time : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united .. kim the hero ..
cleverley again showing how shit he is .. not good enough ! 
wow cant believe wat jus happen ... its like they did it on purpose enough to ruin the day fosure
mufc drop more points !! 2x2 draw
manchester united ! bad business .
why the fuck do i keep putting in my bets ? useless cunts
bang average centre midfielders missing a play maker fair play deserved a draw
still creepin , don't get comfortable 
what a really poor performance that was from united , centre of midfield just isn't good enough at all ! 
fuck it though , point away could be crucial at the end of the season . mufc <3
get in !! ft cardiff 2 - 2 manchester scum scum conceded in extra time !! i will now happily watch motd and fls tonight !!
lost £10 on the manchester united bet .
never betting on manchester untied again

disappointed but well done to cardiff 2-2 
what ever will be , will be , we keep support 
manchester utd having a dose of their own medicine , late minute equalizer sent some of their fans to bed so early ,

premier league players esp man utd players should at least hit the target ! unbelievably poor shooting 
kim bo kyung thank you very much . only one manchester
what a load of horse shit 🐴💩 
hahahahahaha manutd 2-2 . this league is tough .
mufc can't even hold unto a lead past 45mins ...
fellaini and welbeck do you guys smoke up and come ? 
too pissed of to even speak about the match after this tweet 
unbeaten in the last ten games though . so sad 
when will we learn to defend set pieces 
piss poor performance . to be title contenders we should be finishing teams like that off . not good enough 
game done with . no onto the european match 
bullshit !!! totally disappointed with a point , could have gotten all the 3 points 
i'll take a draw after that performance .. now on to spurs next week who will be looking to bounce back ! another hard away game ! 
fucks sake ! rooney shouldn't even have been on the pitch to miss that ... thats right , isn't it ? 
cardiff 2-2 manchester united : kim the hero for the home side . great result for the gunners - and for city and chelsea , as well . 
fuck fellaini he's shite . no carrick or rvp ... no win simples 
tbf we were shit !!! need players in january ! 
manchester united is total shit !!! as in total shit !!!! bahahahahaha my weekend couldn't end on a better note
how many times do we have to watch moyes blow it . moyes out 
south korean kim equalises in added time to earn a draw against 
such a poor performance !! we are gonna get shown up at leverkusen ! minute let down !!
full time : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united scorers : f . campbell , kim bo- kyung | w . rooney , p . evra . 
not really worried about being seven points behind we always play our best football after christmas 
we'll never die 
fucking bullshit . dont tell me that isnt down to coaching losing concentration in last minute . fucking disgrace . 
ft cardiff 2-2 manchester united
dedicating fundamendalz to .....!!
ft : 2-2 i said about 3 or 4 times that we needed another goal , you can't hang on and still win against every team .
how on earth is tom cleverley a manchester united first team player ?
not to be . a good point though 
much deserved points for fought till the end !! need to step up !! 
manchester united fans are feeling today what rahul gandhi fans feel everyday . pathetic .
so frustrating this season watching united ! for that i blame ed woodward ! you useless twat ! roll on january ! 
midfielders essential for a january shopping list . 
the only match i wanted manchester united to win😡⚽
frustrating finish to the game 
rooney should have gone for goal n smalling should have atleast hit on target .. we were poor 
not good football weekend , first lost and now united lost 2 points at cardiff and we need the points 
welbeck , cleverly and smalling really shouldn't be playing for manchester united ....
so far this season i am not all that impressed with man u . 
manchester united cant even win against cardiff city .. what the hell is wrong with this team ?? damn !
were shittt and weree champions !! 😂👍 
fucking manchester united☹
fvcking pissed ! we didn't even bury cardiff ! this is an effing joke . still love my team but there needs to be a change 
 win huge , held to a draw . as that meme goes… " today was a good day ."
stats look pretty even between the two . 
so , i guess what we've learned today is that cardiff city > = manchester clubs . interesting ...
was a certain justice about rooney's inexplicable decision in front of goal , as shouldn't have been on the pitch . but 2 points lost ! 
evra attacks the ball like a forward in the opposition 18 but stands and watches ever time he has to defend one . really poor from him ! 
a massive 2 points dropped , that midfield needs some epic revamping 
- watching manchester united play this season is not good for the ❤️ !
mate played 90 mins with no central midfield influence players eager to get a chance playing reserve games , sat back on a 4-5-1 again
kimmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm . you beauty 
you don't realise how good we had it under fergie . our midfield is terrible , shaky at the back and lost without rvp . 
top 4 ko ! top 20 ni ... u see your mates for top 4 ? 
cardiff 2-2 mufc ft and no doubt there's a party just south of the dmz thanks to bo-kyung kim .
such a frustrating end to that game 
enough of this madness !! was that , learn from the fucking neighbors . applause for what a good game they put up !
wow well done cardiff ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united the south korean is the hero for cardiff .
that performance didn't deserve a win it's as simple as that . 
look at manchester united , do you see anything to smile about ?
i love my club , i trust my manager , but he nids 2get it 2gether in a hurry . at the moment we look ordinary , we r manutd dammit !
hopefully we go to tottenham next sunday and win 
cardiff city > manchester united
yesss cardiff 2-2 manchester united thats two points dropped ahaha
fuck off cardiff city ( n ) ft : cardiff city ( 2 ) vs ( 2 ) man united 
i'm blaming welbeck , i'm pissed off and i'm been mardy for the rest of the day . 
fantastic performance from cardiff , has to be said . took their chances well , faultless 
united just got trolled again !! oops 
disappointed in that game 👎 fs 
goal cardiff 2-2 manchester united ( tb ) 
take a moment to look at the ' true champion ' guys . 
a promoted side getting 4 out of 6 points vs manchester clubs at home 👏👏 quality
 mortal after all ? wow what a finish 
i can't pinpoint one fault in the team but it's just generally a mediocre team apart from the strikers 
glory glory manchester united !
i never slag united players of . but we payed 27 million for a afro 
midfield pairing of cleverley and fellaini is nowhere good enough for a club like united 
ft : cardiff 2-2 united oh united we love you !!!! :) 
worst performance of the season . trolled us by trying to pass the ball to : full time 2-2 
puto manchester united
robbie lost 10 on an accum yesterday , and said last night " i'll win it back on a manchester double tomorrow " hahaha 
6-3-3 - 21 points out of a possible 36 . played some shocking stuff at times ( miles , absolute miles behind europe's best) . 
fair play to city , they were sublime today and we were once again lacklustre . very frustrating result . we go again midweek in germany . 
manchester , anywhere about printworks with shisha bars ?
we didn't deserve to win today . draw is the fair result . 
cardiff city 2 manchester united 2-full time yes ! manu kalah .. xd
its cardiff 2 2 ... next . still in 7th place only 7 points from top .........
wat was that ! wat was that ! 
pathetic showing from united today , had chances and couldn't finish . 
idiots we had the game won rubbish at the back david moyes/players need to sort it out 
at least we stay above ! 
oh what a result next tottenham
 worst display in years . poor passes . poor defending . poor line up . from the defense to the attackers we just completely fuck up .
i would love to see mufc playing better . they will need a different manager because moyes is woefully clueless . time to go . 
win , lose , draw . i will always support manchester united 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united . php -_-
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united f . campbell ( 33 ) bo-kyung kim ( 90+1 ) for cardiff .. w . rooney ( 15 ) p . evra ( 45) .. for manu ....
kim you bastard ! well there is always next week 
england - premier league ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
fellaini , cleverley , evans , ferdinand .... these should never play for united again . consistently shit week in , week out . 
still unbeaten in 10 matches 
manchester city has a fucking goal difference of 22 and we are fucking 4th . makes no sense .
what shite have i just witnessed ? 
must be a painful draw for all you mufc supporters ...
i dont think smalling deserve man utd jersey . 
rooney really gave that last one away 
shit boring game but was almost a top result given the amount of players missing . cardiff is no easy place to go and take points . 
what united used to do in 90min is doing by other teams to united . you are 3 step down . 
now it's getting really annoying . drew from winning position . we are going to regret these dropped points . 
waiting outside the manchester arena for you me at six and 30 seconds to mars eek
cardif 2 vs 2 manchester united
cardiff awesome .. both manchester cant beat cardiff at their home .. :d
not a bad result , we're still unbeaten in the last 10 matches ! 
no sense in complaining about that , would have been daylight robbery to get all 3 pts based on performance . rollercoaster continues 
lol from winning arsenal to dropping points at cardiff , that's what i call progress :" d 
there's been a right mix up in manchester david moyles is working on the radio therefore is chris moyles managing utd
lets all laugh at manchester united hahahahaha
feels like christmas !! 🎄 lovely day !! shopped till i dropped !! 😜
bad defending on last minute . need more impressive game . 
 have a better injured xi than they do a fit first team at the moment .
omg manutd please :(
ft = cardiff city 2 : 2 manchester united > =) | rooney , evra | cambell , kim
not mighty manchester united . threw a lot of chances and once again conceded late goals . what a let down
nice one cardiff city !! back to being 8 points behind leaders ! and balance is restored in the universe , all is right again .
knew that goal was coming draw not a bad result next up a tough one in leverkusen 
good performance cardiff ! keeps manutd 7 points below my gunners 
a 2-2 draw against cardiff is not good enough . 
4 points from 6 against manchester clubs this season . few clubs are going to do that . what a great game first and foremost . played as a team
well , 1 point enough .. not a good game .. 
that's the worst play ever from wayne rooney 
amsyong 
united , these performances are not good enough 
2-2 cant believe we gave that away in et . 1 point from this game n sure there's gonna be some exchange in the dressing room . 
and just like that , manchester united are back to being shit .
only if welbeck had taken that chance .. 
fuck me , i'm fucking pissed off , wtf !, we played like a fucking bottom half table team , we manchester united what the actual fuck
thanks cardiff city . 
manchester united !!!
ft man utd 2-2 cardiff city . keep calm and love manchester united ♥ 
what the fuck they say ... glory glory manchester united ...
hope the squad struggle to sleep tonight , they played fucking shit 
it's a bit disappointed but always manutd !!
get moyes out !!! giggs is past it !!!! 
i don't even know what to say about manchester united
so , conclusion ? manchester united atau cardiff city menang ?
 , another good result dave you pudding !! 
carl froch stops george groves in ninth round with premature stoppage - jeff powell : jeff powell ringside in manchester : george grove ...
manchester city 6 tottenham 0 - match report : early jesus navas strike sets city on their way : ian ladyman at the etihad stadium : aft ...
i'm pleased that ryan giggs received the appropriate reception today 
david moyes there , proving you don't need to win games to be a winner ... but he is a winner 
lmao ... manchester united
glory be to god ! a draw is cool for " us " 
i fucking hate asians . fuck everything 
arsenal 2-0 southampton everton 3-3 liverpool manchester city 6-0 tottenham cardiff 2-2 manchester united
only one team in manchester
i am sooooooooo heated 
disappointed but not ashamed to be a fan .
a club of manchester united's stature is expected to win every time they play . performance against cardiff was poor . should have won .
2 points behind manchester city and southampton . i'll settle for that ... 
i knew this was gonna happen ..... we let them settle very fast ... that's why we need carrick every match .... 
ferguson took the fergie time away with him 
manchester united are currently 6th
fulltime : 2 2 . missed the golden chance to go 4th on the table
poor defending from has destroyed my birthday today . now am out of the wire till next day . so sad oh !
manchester united
manchester united fans are so upset right now #5thplace 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
cardiff city again ! manchester cant beat malaysia ! proud to be a malaysian !
boo mu hahaha yeahh cardiff 2-2 manutd ..
full time : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united . a game that should have been won but threw it away . just have to take the draw . haish .
alright ! never mind ! united for life ! 
waste 3 points sia manutd seriously
never seen a weaker united centre mid , cleverley and fellaini absolutely rammel ... never been united players 
i wonder how moyes can justify selecting fellaini ahead of anderson . 
frustrating game ! missed opportunity for man u ! 
cardiff city terrorising manchester clubs since 2013 !!! hell yeah !!
arrgh ... sucks to walk away with just 1 point ... not such a consistent match 
when sold i said it then that he is better than weldone 
when's moyes gonna learn you can't win a game by 1 goal !! 
absolutely madness 
well that was a decent weekend of football rounded off nicely watching mufc dropping two points , of course main thing we took three points .
we could have won this game 😒
fellaini is a different level of shite . 
thanks manchester united ! good game :'(
disappointing performance . didn't deserve to win but got away with a draw , full credit to cardiff . rooney just shoot man ⚽️
ft at cardiff city stadium . late equaliser by cardiff to snatch the draw . cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
full-time : manchester 10-4 leeds and wakefield . match report to follow .
every 5 naira team will start smelling blood now ...... all thanks to this piece of shit team they now call manchester united
even though we had a draw , i'm singing the song ! glory glory , man utd !!!!!!
it wasn't good enough . the lads lost the pace and good atmosphere they showed on recently games . blame international football . 
there really needs to be a big overhaul of players at mufc some of these lads are not good enough for man utd 2nd team ! 
uniteds midfield was awful today ... 
thanks for today at wales 
last minute equaliser , seriously manutd ? wth
fellaini absolutely woeful . won't make a united player as long as i've got a hole in my arse 
tom cleverly is by far one of the worst players in the midfield that ever played for manchester united . 
the name ' manchester ' is definitely not welcome in cardiff
missed carrick so badly that game . more than rvp 
be happy with 1 point manchester united :)
threw it away 
i have tried to defend this season , but they are plain shit , won't get top 4 this season
after 12 games , manchester united are 6th ... struggling to get top 4 .
such a bad game for manchester united ...
btw was i the only one who had a near heart attack thinking ji sung park just scored against united ? i was like omg wth lmao ! 
yes , manchester is blue , red only for north london and liverpool :p
you do not always have to defend what you have , going for more is the old united way . 
manchester wank wank wank !!!!
the title race should be over for united , can't win trophy with team like this . lack of everything , so poor ... 
7 points behind ... it'll be 10 by next week after spurs . 
ya'll need to leave moyes alone it took six years for sir alex to fit in at old trafford 
final : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united 
full time : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united emotional game .
awful game with some awful players getting what they deserved - most had a game to forget thfc next - wounded lion ? 
oh but i remember . marouane fellaini was top priority 
ft : cardiff 1 - 2 . a pulsating game ends all square as an injury-time header from kim bo-kyung gives cardiff a point
manchester united need to start using witchcraft
anyway ... i love the positive fans , great supporters ! thats 10 games unbeaten in all competitions for 
fuck !! manchester united ..
united so crap we beat arsenal then we draw what the hell !!!!!! 
fellani is one of the worst players i think manchester untied have ever had , 
full time : cardiff city vs manchester united 2 - 2 ( campbell 33 ', kim 90+1 ) ( rooney 15 ', evra 45 ' ) 
ft : cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united stay at fifth ..
next week manutd wakujie lessons on how to deal with promoted teams !!! 
full time . cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
manchester united is having trouble haha
we need midfield additions in january and not just one . 
what the actual fuck ? how have we drew that ? against title contenders cardiff ... 
 kim with a bullet header a sucker punch at the death of time in a deserving thrilling 2-2 draw vs 
aslan aslan cardiff city won manchester city 3-2 .
 the joys of being a united fan .
can't believe we have dropped points yet again !! 
2-2 in wales ... manchester united go home ...... you aren't drunk .. you're shit
manchester useless ! lucky with a point .
hard to believe fellaini and cleverly are running the midfield . both are vastly overrated ... europa quality
and again , an against goal at the end of the match ! stand still at 6th now ! 
were still unbeaten anyway 
 i could have scored that chance rooney missed
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
its not moyes fault for the late goal manutd concead today .
team manchester united , hope u guys know you have fans . coach moyes , is fellani your wife ?! u don't know what substitute means ????
this was nail biting again ... its a draw 2:2 
manchester united na werey !!
all moyes ' fault ? some clueless folk about ! presume he told evra to switch off/directed smalling to give stupid fk away ? 
glad that did to what man utd have been doing for years in scoring in stoppage time ! how does it feel ? 
manchester united ......
we don't need felani 
cardiff city 3-2 man city , cardiff city 2-2 man utd , malaysia > manchester
these results and last minute sloppy goals are starting to piss me off now ! we're throwing away points ! 
manchester united are just poor man👎
unbefuckenlievable ! 
awful 
cardiff city score in the 92nd minute . 2-2 . lol .
[ ft ] cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united ( campbell , kim - rooney , evra )
didn't deserve anything more than a point . so many players not fit to wear the shirt . completely committed to moyes , not others . 
london trends : promoted patrice evra sebastian vettel 1 ireland avb
hahahahaa yesssss !!!! great end to the weekend . love you kim bo-kyung . gotta love the prem . 
's draw totally made my day ! hahaha
still amuses me every time i see fellaini play for manchester united 😂😂😂 what a waste of 27 million pounds 😂😂😂
damn they have a big gap in their midfeild when carrick doesnt play . giggs cant be a regular .
didn't deserve to win tbh 
i so turned a prophet today 
ft cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
even at home 4 points from 6 against the manchester clubs . how many people would have tipped cardiff for that at the start of the season
cardiff hold manchester united 2-2 . ft . 
i’m sure medel’s unpunished punch at fellaini will get the same coverage as rooney incident ? 
manchester united still unbeaten in last 10 match !
what a match ! euphoria at as kim bo kyung nets a stoppage-time equaliser against , a first for the south korean 2-2 
ft score : cardiff 2-2 manchester united great game ! 
 what are you doing !?? i still love you xx
we suck a hanging on to a 1 goal lead ... 
no one fears manchester united as a team anymore , rooney is carrying them single handedly this season with the odd rvp goal as well
1 point against cardiff . what else is there say apart from i'm going to get another glass of wine 😢 
we play spurs with the same midfield combo we are most likely to get annihilated . 
manchester urinated again ...
ccfc 2 mufc 2 not bad result me thinks
premier league , 24 nov ft cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
wtf is going on ffs united what are u playing at 
hahaha manchester united back to making my evenings ! splendid . 
what a disappointing result , does not help when we have a waste of damn space playing in a vital midfield role .... 
final score : cardiff 2 manchester united 2 . your thoughts ?!
we had at least 2 late chances to put this one away . both welbeck & rooney couldn't put the ball in a wide open goal !!! disappointing . 
manchester united :(
full time cardiff city 2 manchester united 2
can't get over it i swear down kim your going home in a manchester ambulance
 
oh no draw !!! 
sadly poor all round 
where are all those manutd dans who were gloating after one game ? one game doesnt define a season . hope you have learnt a lesson today .
at least we didn't lose 
smh at manchester united .
this is why i call manchester united , shit !!!!
half time cardif v man . utd 2-2 
gutted and pissed off yet again , exact same shit against fucking southampton ! 
once again invite pressure on , then let a goal in . kill the effing game off 
still united . i love manchester united . . we shall rise .
i'm more pissed off that rooney didn't shoot !! 
i'm so mad right now .. just when i thought we would be making up for lost times ! shit ! my loyalty remains nonetheless ! 
good point we have a lot of average players if we're honest 
it's okayy good game manchester united 
manchester united always feel the need to raise my blood pressure
yes manchester united just made my day dem shaa passs .
moyes out 
will never die 
the right result . but ... why wayne ? why ?! 
we a manchester but dnt forget united through the pain joy we still the red
can't believe we have let another lead slip . it's not good enough ! 
pathetic at best !! gonna have to improve massively for wednesday 
only manchester united will find a way to tie cardiff 
1 . australia thrash england 2 . spurs bageled in football 3 . manchester united drop points 4 . mark webber with p2 .. super sunday indeed !!!!
today is the worst game from manchester united
2-2 , nowhere near our best , but thought we did well enough to nick it . oh well , at least we've moved upto 6th , 7 points away from arsenal 
center mid was dreadful . 
why cant we finishhh !!!!!!! 
champions and yet we can't hold a fucking lead . i'm ashamed this is happening way to often 
terrible united performance yet again !! 
it's not funny anymore : used to lose points once every 12 games . they've now dropped to a ratio of once every second game .
win , lose , draw still love united ! 
i think it's time to head on back to everton moyes . oh and bring your afro(re)jack fellaini along with you . 
i don't think davey moyes understands fergie time ... he's got it all wrong . let's all laugh at united ! 
that game is proof enough that bad things always happen to good people . fuckery
dont see how we can win the league with that kind of performance 
fuck ... fuck ... fuck .... i'm really hating myself right now ... we're playing so bad 
ahh so close to win but had to fuckin blow it !!! arhhhh cardiff city you arhhh 
fellaini and cleverley . super super disappointing 
all cardiff aren't we ? 🙊 
well manchester united always like to do it the hard way .
fellaini and moyes are shit couple of the year .... 
and the misery continues for 
we didn't win ..... here go the glory boys .... get behind your manager and team ... stop whingeing ... or go support city !! 
nightmare for man u fans . they'll be crying in surrey , cornwall , stockholm , osaka ... oh and a few in manchester .
full-time : cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united [ campbell , kim ; rooney , evra ] 
if only rooney had used his brain . * sad *
big big loss !! although the results show's a draw .!! jus wen v wer getting some momentum in to d season this resut s a setbck !
let's be honest danny welbeck is not good enough to be a striker for manchester united . he's finishing is shit . this team needs a revamp .
 absolute joke !!!!
 : one step forward , two steps backward .
this is what happens when you rely on a one goal lead wasting so many chances . | 
i think on the whole , we didn't deserve to win it but we had more than enough chances . we are playing a very poor brand of football . 
best way to end a great weekend of sports . thank you . 
can't get away always , can we !!! 
neither manchester teams able to breach fortress cardiff 
good result for cardiff , considering half their fans are manchester united fans anyway 
cardiff city 2 - 2 man u . :d ..... relegation la manchester united :p
once again our spurning of chances lets us down ✋ 
unbeaten in 10 😃 
cardiff 2-2 manchester united
cardiff 2 manchester 1
smh !! why why why dammit .. 
7 points off top , 3 points off 2nd , i don't know what to say .. 
pls give welbeck away for free 
is the answer to our problems ?? 
really missed rvp today and fellani is just slow 
rip manchester utd . 
fellani is fucking useless . 
ft : cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united . 
gpplah god played from manchester united :)) 
oh manchester united ..... lfc are 7 points above you ........... that is why .... 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 man . united mu(wazza , evra ) cardiff ( campbell , kim maho )
good , tough away point at cardiff . could have nicked it in the end but i think the result was fair . onwards and upwards . 
cardiff 2 manchester united 2 ( ft )
getting fed up now 
apart from manchester blues all the other teams in the prem are average
we should have been 4th ( 23 points) . now we're 6th ( 21) . 
lmaoo manchester united can't beat cardiff , dropped 2 points there , great
kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim ! asians always play well against the manchester teams ...?
but i'm not upset , it's gonna be a long season .. 
what a waste !! 4th place what a waste 
no comment !!! 
cleverly also with a job to convince moyes he's mufc quality . since when did central midfielders give up trying to score goals ?
what rubbish from .
still welbecks miss killed us . chance to go 3-1 and as per usual he miss hits the ball in the box . not good enough and shit result 
ft : cardif 2-2 manchester united 
second time this happens !! so fucking weak performance by so many united players today .. words can describe my disappointment . fuck 
yes . well done . 2 points further behind us . twas a great weekend . 
reus/di maria and draxler need to be our top targets in january 
and fuck all the useless cunts wearing red i'm manchester
rooney completely artur boruc'd that ... 
question moyes ' substitution decisions . what was the point in bringing welbeck on ?! what did giggs do ? started with clevz for godsake ! 
so , cardiff unbeaten vs manchester duo ... 1 win , 1 draw
cardiff city 2- mufc 2
4 points against the manchester clubs uno
7 points behind arsenal , 3 behind liverpool/chelsea and 1 point behind city . 
sorry to say i'm not a manchester united fans anymore
my pick for worst play on the pitch against cardiff is fellaini 
i don't think we're going to be retaining our title this season now ! 
too many harsh word from manchester united fans right now
david moyes is a stupid man . he doesn't get it . fellaini is a hindrances to manutd . i'm totally not convinced by this manager
cardif 2 vs 2 mufc .... congratz ..... gunnerz all de way
and who says all need are midfielders ? get a solid centre back pair for fuck sakes !!!!
you manutd fans cant touch me
ft : manchester united 2 - 2 cardiff city
cardiff city 1 - man utd 1 played ok today , nothing more , so i guess a draw was fair 👿 we all know cardiff are dangerous on set pieces 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
free kick * but same deal 
lol at the people that are laughing ... new manager ... no signings , injuries and still in an around that area oooook then 
to all the people that argued with me in the transfer window saying fellaini would be a good signing , what are your thoughts now ? 
 once again welbeck can't finish and that cost us the game , when is moyes going to realize that welbeck is useless
fellaini as tall as he is offers nothing at set pieces offence or defensively 
what ? manchester why do this to me
it's very clear that we don't learn lessons from southampton match . fuck all . i hate moyes . i hate now
man united are a fucking joke !!! david moyes hasn't got a fucking clue the useless cunt !!!!!!!!!! 
weekends over & i can't wait for the next one yayyyyy 
the full time cardiff 2 manchester united 2 /sounds like the narrator and sompret to kim bo kyu ! 
just when everyone thought the season was taking off for manchester united , we are back to familiar inconsistent levels . disappointing .
wanna hear the lamest joke of the year ? manchester united .
united's midfield is awful . none of them should be at manchester united . but still hahahahahaaa
manchester and cardiff thank you for such a lovely weekend
frustrating cardiff didn't deserve anything but the league is so open drawing not the end of the world 
cardiff loves upsetting big teams .. won against man city , drawn against everton & now a 90th minute equalizer to users united .. 
 yet again drop off again at the end of the match . midfield very very poor . moyes needs to sort it . two points dropped again .
shitty manchester united 
latest top 4 : arsenal liverpool chelsea manchester city
missed rvp , he would have buried some of our chances today .... ft 2-2 better job than citeh :)
we played shit today 
cardiff city 2 manchester united 2 well done boys
worst man utd team ever !! cleverely , smalling , evans , welbeck and fellaini should never be in our team ! painful to watch ! 
manchester united ain't shit lol
get in there kim you beauty !!! can't stand but they deserved a point there . rooney's challenge was a disgrace . 
very sloppy from today . fellaini is one of the worst center mids i've seen at united . seriously need the buy in january 
mufc how market ????
amazing ! cardiff grab an equaliser in nomorefergie time 
lose , draw or win i'll always support united , 
still only 3 points off second place , could be worse i suppose ! 
so much for the big comeback didn't even deserve the draw . keep falling !!!!!
arsenal won , spurs lost , manutd drew , liverpool drew . premier league couldn't get any better this weekend ★
cleverly needs more work , and shouldn't be starting . anderson would be a good replacement until a midfielder is bought in january . 
that's some bullshit - how did united let the lead slip in the 88th min - a sloppy ending , they took their eyes off the prize 
one , two , three : hahahahaha 
you going to cry manchester utd fans ? you gunna cry ? want me to phone your mam for you ?
 tho . 
all the buildings in manchester are like skyscrapers it something oup
the demise of manchester united !!!
win , lose or draw . i'm still manchester united fans !! 
some very very ... very average players in this united squad , unfortunately we recently just paid short of 30million for one of them ! 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
ft| cardiff 2-2 united : we weren't good enough ... though many have come here and lost , can't say i'm happy with the point . 
oh . oh that's happened . fuck . 
giving up goals in the first 5 and last 5 minutes have cost us valuable points this season . 
wow what an awful manchester united team this is 
sila letak jawatan wahai moyes . you bring nothing to manchester united .
deserved that . had at least four golden opportunities only scored two 
cardif ( 2 ) vs manchester united ( 2 ) 
bpl| ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united | 
2-2 was a fair result . fun game to watch . 
can we not play welbeck ever again please ???? and evra has been daydreaming defending every corner and dead ball . sort it out !!!! 
there is very little in life that makes me happier than seeing manchester united concede last minute goals
 ni dawa ya manchester teams . thank u 
hahahaha yes cardiff , rooney shouldnt of even been on the pitch 
the bayern home game is the only game i've enjoyed this season . haven't played well for 90 minutes outside that .
 one on ones 
 de gea once again proves he is worthless
are united back to the relegation zone ?? 
say what you want .. but we've been defying critics for over a 100 years .. & we don't intend on stopping now ! ♥
god dey , correct your mistakes and get ready for the next game ... 
glory glory manchester united !! still got faith in them !
not bad lah : 3 
to put it in better words , ' we're sh*t ! . sort the mf problem out , moyes ! start by not starting cleverley !
keep calm and always support man united ! good night~ 
the sooner david moyes gets the sack the better !! boring , average football with no desire or commitment 
ft 2-2 , big opportunity missed to go 4th just 1 behind liverpool and chelsea ! oh well we move on to spurs next week ! 
 again concedes a late tying goal to a lower quality team . not saying but this has got to stop ! at least it wasn't at ot ...
fucking yes ! i love my football team ! been in my dad's ear so much ! think man united were lucky to draw , too ! cardiff 2-2 manchester united !
 : 56% - percentage of cardiff's premier league goals this season that have come at home to the two manchester teams 
where are those fans i told they ain't winning today ?! bless ya'll .. lmfao !!
cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united 😕
draw fair result . not good enough today . cardiff had a fantastic attitude towards that game today especially 2nd half 
shitty defending in both goals conceded . 
as ordinary as look lately we should of put that game to bed . some stupid chances missed . i'm looking at you danny !
mean while in the red half of manchester . ..... lol
ft | cardiff city ( campbell 33 ', kim 90+1 ' ) 2 - 2 ( rooney 15 ', evra 45 ' ) manchester united bad game ! bad result ...! 
my head hurts 
win , lose or draw . manchester united till i die . 
cardiff really collected 4 points from manchester .
 
david moyes is theee biggest fuck up of a manager united have ever had he is ruining our club 
the game against tottenham is huge for both clubs 
and cardiff will be thinking arsenal is like the two manchester teams .
final cardiff 2-2 manchester united .
haha that game was just too too funny 
stupid kim with your first premier goal . manchester is still better .
where has the hunger to win gone !? simply not good enough 
well fuck that . today has been one of ‘ those ’ days . 
manchester united are nowhere near our best . disappointing result . fuck ! gotta sink these teams if we wanna be on top .
argh !!!!! fuck manutd fuck moyes fuck welbeck fuck ferguson for recommending moyes fuck the glazers for not sacking moyes argh !!!!
ft manchester city 6 - 0 tottenham hotspur ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester unitedb
you can stick your 10 games unbeaten stat right up your fucking japs eye the lot of ye . that was utterly dreadful stuff today 
manchester united could of got three points today ! david moyes needs to sign star players and sell people like fellaini . 
kim kardashian saves da day fr cardiff yes dats ryt man utd cud stop her boobs frm pokin da ball in 
whittingham is such a gifted player with that wand of a left foot . well deserved point for cardiff , 4 from 6 v manchester clubs .
got such continually low expectations every time play . this must be what it feels to support liverpool . 
2 massive massive points dropped for united !!!!! 
a deal for manchester united to re-sign cristiano ronaldo remains a possibility and could happen after the 2014 world cup .
 wins , the pack gains no ground , get annihilated and ties again ! great week in the 
defense sucked . finishing sucked . thank our stars we got one point . 
however , must admit that numerous players were injured , but still no excuses to throw the 3-points away .
hahaha . ain't going to say anything . i'm too tired lah . trash shouldn't forget their place . be grateful with one point . anti manutd !
goal conceded from a set piece at late minutes for the second time , precious points wasted… 
cardiff 2-2 yes cardiff should of won untied the cheats !! 
funny , but under we were talking about 10 wins in a row . now , we are celebrating 10 games in a row , but undefeated ...!!! 😔😔😔 
i hate 
fulltime cardiff 2-2 manutd keep calm and keep support manchesterunited !! *beer *
tottenham losing , man united losing ... as an arsenal supporter that is a perfect day !! 
i knew it ! 
wo goals from manchester united 
cardiff city scores a dramatic injury time equaliser against manchester united through kim bo-kyung to make it 2-2 
7 points clear of manchester united ..!! can the season be over now ..!!! 😜
fucks sake thats the title gone ! why why why ????!!!!
was that another poor performance or just an average performance from an average team ? lacking ideas , drive , composure and shape . 
fellani is shit ! what is he doing at united ! we need midfield @ united someone who can actually attack ! get your eyes open ! 
evra scores and is the cause of letting a goal go also . super fail . 
gash 
manchester united stay in 6th place but are now 7 points behind arsenal in 1st . 
a draw ! carrick , get well soon -forever manchester united
full time : 2-2 
what do you expect when you've got fellaini and cleverly starting as your cms . 
we are manchester united and we never do it the easy way
to many boys making a living playing for united that wouldnt start for most championship clubs 
haha my bro has gone to bed on an empty stomach , damn you 
moyes out !!!! are so timid these days !
get that curly-headed fuck out as well as cleverly and anderson .. not able to play in top " class " teams 
win , lose , or draw man . united till i die !! 
 its okay we always support . good game !! draw ft 2 - 2 cardiff city
right moyes has there ever been a bigger sign we need a creative midfielder ... i'm available and better than cleverly !! 
typical tried defending a 1 goal lead and drops more points 
not in fergie time yo . 
beware when manchester city want to flog you .... expect nothing less than 5 goals
that injury time didn't help you this time did it . 
another reason why i should boycott moyes ' manutd . did you see that performance ?
2 points dropped by cardiff city against that shower of shit that is . so poor its laughable
is not good result ! but keep calm and suport united , 24/7 ! the season is too long ! 
the end of the twelfth tour for manchester united : * play : 12 * win : 6 * draw : 3 * losses : 3 * points : 21 * his goals : 20 * in : 15 # mufc
 and made my week end thank u guys 
david moyes needs to understand that he's managing manchester united and not everton . we dont hold onto one goal leads , we go for more !
only standard player today was smalling but in the end he undone that by conceding that costly fk 
tottenham coming up next and they surely don't want to lose to another manchester club now .
we are mufc !
moyes out ? no , just give more little few faith in him 
full time : cardiff city- 2 manchester united- 2
coupon buster 
a draw . 
fulltime : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united :)
arsenal , liverpool chelsea manchester city southhampton everton manchester united
things need to change at mufc asap !!!!
we r just as shit , i've had enough of watching us play terrible football ! can't remember the last time we played well ! 
still in title race ? my foot 😜😆😆 
cardiff city's fans are fantastic . i hope they stay up 
takes another striker off and puts midfielder on why so defensive moyes you cunt !!! 
 consider thst two points lost ... what idiots .....
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united ,
who gives a fuck . better than losing , didnt do enough to win it ! stop moaning 
 can't even beat . sad 
tottenham really flopped today ahaha 6-0 manchester city looool
game over ... manchester united 2-2 cardiff city ...
we didn't lose . calm yourselves . 
why is trending ? :o is david moyes that bad ?
moyes must go 
cant believe it 
ft 2 2 . cardiff showed incredible spirit , and appeared to want it more than a weak looking united squad .
another 2 points dropped . poor performance really 
i'm gonna need some serious stone roses to get me over that disappointment 
sorry sorry manutd sorry sorry manutd .... really i mean that
tottenham boss andre villas-boas admitted his side had paid a ' heavy price ' for a woeful performance as they lost 6-0 to manchester city .
coulda been in 4th with a win today . that's what hurts the most 😫 
if you'd really have to fault moyes , it's consistently picking underperforming players that just don't cut it , academy product or not 
fucking kim costing me my " safe manchester double "
would have really loved to freaking win tonight but i'm glad we didn't loose , final score 2-2 . 
pissed away a chance to go 4th and just 5 points behind arsenal , and crucially , ahead of city . 7 off the lead now , and behind city 
the worst of it is that we were playing cardiff , not a top club ... we could have ended in 4th ... unbelieveble 
that second half performance was horrendous . got what they deserved . big improvement needed for wednesday night
ft cardiff 2 2 manchester united . good game walaupun telat panas
well , shit 
i think medel is a fan and he showed his frustration for fellaini's poor display by punching him
southampton and now cardiff .. when will stop dropping at the death ?
i despise fellaini . i really do . from the everton days . 
moyes get this into your fucking skull , fellaini is not worthy to be in that squad .... he is just a piece of shit .... 
yes , done ...!! nyengir dulu ah buat fans congrats to be a loser !!! hahahah lol ..!! congrats to be a winner ,, we are 
cardiff probably deserved to win that to be honest , but rooney had great chance to win it at the end why didnt he just finish it ! 
 defense let nonsense get under their skin ... 2-2 
big 5 standing bpl : 1 . arsenal ( 28poin ) 2 . liverpool ( 24poin ) 3 . chelsea ( 24poin ) 4 . manchester city ( 22poin ) 5 . southampton ( 22poin )
awful performance today , too many players not showing up 
fucking knew it from the start . fuck it . could have climbed to 4th . 
well done cardiff . taken some cracking scalps this season . when they were rusty & when they were in form . great consistency !
ft 2-2 . - the hero in the capital . i knew wouldn't lay down and die . great support ! 
shittttttt ! great great disappoint ! we should have won it ! why are we giving away points like this , this season . 
match ends , cardiff city 2 , manchester united 2 .

bitter disappointment 
just awful . not suprised tbqh .

rooney we still love u ! : * 
 | ¡final en el cardiff stadium ! cardiff city 2-2 manchester united .
this never happened under fergie , miss him a lot 
whatever ... we r united .. :(
full time manchester city vs tottenham hotspur ( 6-0 ) manchester united vs cardiff city ( 2-2 ) setang 6
ball possession : cardiff : 58% manchester united : 42% there is a thing called , " running with the ball , guys ." ever heard of it ?
manchester united are useless cunts . ruin too many bets .
has moyes woken up from his nap to realise cardiff did equalise ? 
2 words , 1 man , michael carrick ! 
that fvcking annoying moment when moyes claps after a disappointing game . 
come on united . wtf guys can't keep giving up late goals man utd 2-2 cardiff city 
fellaini has been a terrible buy for us . a complete flop !! the only thing he's added to our team is more bookings & red cards 
heartbreak for us , we were very unkucky to get just 1pt from d game 
cleverley & fellaini could be the worst centre midfield pairing i have ever seen in a united shirt outplayed by cardiff 😡 garbage !!!
did i say screams and shouts ? i meant moans and cries ... lots of cries . 
soo i have a camp later on and i just wasted 2 hours of my sleep only to see manutd draw . ffs
for fuck sake . the midfield is shit 
i think manchester united needs a new coach more than anything
when vidic partners evans , manutd doesn't look so useless defending setpieces !! 
good game red devils ! hopefully continue get to better result . :)
damn we used to get late winner and yet we're conceding late ones we can't win the league with such performance 
mufc fans chill na , fellaini can become your own ramsey . the only fear is that i don't know if that time will ever come ☹
let us all pause for a moment of laughter 
 have gained another draw against a lower team .... good job .... 
not the worst result in the world when playing away from home but it does feel like 2 pts dropped 
well deserved ! 2-2 
aaaaaaaaaannnnndddd we're back ! hahahaha
we love you manchester united !!!
fuck international breaks . why are they even playing them ? 
yes ! cardiff city scores a dramatic injury time equaliser against manchester united through kim bo-kyung to make it 2-2
absolutely terrible performance today from the entire team . 
and the match ends with a 2-2 draw between manchester united and cardiff city
ft : cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united 
i disagree with the substitutions that moyes made & it probably hurt us as did the missed opportunities . ugh . 
well that ruined my day 
cardiff thoroughly deserved something from the game ! 
so fucking annoying , another late goal conceded 
cardiff city fully deserved a point from that match , well played the bluebirds :) ! .
so fucking annoying , another late goal conceded 
tubsy-turvy finish . had opportunities to win it but between welbeck & rooney the contrived to scuff their shots . we'd take the point
moyes slow to react again . 
win , lose or draw .. manchester united forver !!
fuck la .. can win don't wanna win 
ft cardiff city 2-2 manchester united :(
manu deserve to lose sef ... fuck david moyes fuck wayne rooney and fuck the most stupid player on the pitch fellaini .. 
gotta stay positive . still on an unbeaten run . was always gonna be a tricky match , tough luck , you can't win them all . 
welbeck is wank . a manchester united player has to take them chances when given . fellaini well what can i say . hope we have the receipt
full-time : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united ( campbell , kim ; rooney , evra) .
fuck you manchester united !!!!!!! how can you concede in the last minutes of the game !!!!!!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡
i'm shocked at how poor fellani has been ..... he was a boss at everton ...... guess the pond in manchester is a bit big for him
when i said hours ago that manutd will struggle to get number 4 some tweeps scorned me ! kuleni hiyo
this isn't manchester united you're seeing . illusions , illusions everywhere .
cardiff ! well done today ! you just help every team above manutd .
manchester united has ruined my sunday 
fini les paris sportifs et f **** manchester united .
lol manchester when will u learn
if cleverley , welbeck and fucking smalling were foreign they would be no were near uniteds first team useless fucking shite 
manchester united , what's going on ? :) 
fergie time : scoring a late equalizer/winner . moyes time : letting the other team score a later equalizer/winner . 
manchester united fans crawled out of the wholes 2 weeks ago after the win against arsenal .. now they're back in that whole😂 
 a 2-2 draw against cardiff city which is such a disappointing result especially since we conceded in stoppage time !
 ft : manchester city 6 - 0 tottenham ! ft : cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united ! good results ! well done cardiff !
to think we actually kept cleverley , and let pogba go . cleverley should be playing for luton town or leyton orient ! 
blocked ! 84 : see manchester united fans face lmaoooo dont block me plsssssssssssssss "
pissed . 
need vidic back quickly ! 
is phil a jones available for leverkusen and/or spurs ? 
2 - 2 we'll never give up ! 
well played , cardiff . our midfield is really shit . 
what a waste 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united . huft
welbeck and rooney misses cost us . plus moyes invited pressure by being defensive . 
one thing is certain . mufc aint winning the league , moyes still needs time .. we should just hope on qualifying 4 next season's ucl .
cardiff city ( 2 ) - ( 2 ) manchester united ( ft )
great free kick to give away from . smallung !!! we aint winning the league this season 
now let's show manutd how to beat cardiff next week 
manchester united , liverpool and spurs drop points ... 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
 na pendullum , jes goin back and forth
hard luck boys 
wat an unexpected turn of events for the manutd-cardiff match
during the war officers were shot for abandoning their duty ... patrice evra give the armband up now !! 
lol i guess manchester united's win against was a fluke
its fine .. its extremely fine !!! 
is that game isn't a sign that we need a new worldclass cm then i dont know what is , i'm sorry but cleverley & fellaini are just shit . 
i'm going to celebrate today's magnificent footballing spectaculars with a nice , dark , dog walk . i may be singing . 
manchester city 6-0 totthenam
thrilling time to be a united fan 
fellaini is brilliant 😳 
sad times for mufc fans . channel5 next season ? maybe .. just maybe
deserved point to be fair like i've said for months to many none material players in that squad just picking up a pay check !!!!!
well that scuppered the manchester double , sums up my luck this weekend !
cardiff !! thank you for shutting man-utd's short term revival ! 
cardiff is gonna be a tough place to go for anyone . ( ask city . ) and really showed how important carrick is . on to leverkusen . 
manchester is bluemoon !
why did rooney pass .. where was the chip when you need to !?! 
fellaini + cleverley are dog shite 
manchester is definitely blue at the moment ...
disappointed tit !
ffs 
piss poor 
the explosion of fucks from known manutd fans must mean they didn't win . hurrah !!!
they messed up everything 
lucky to come away with a point ! awful performance ! 
01010 // youre hot , and support mufc , you da man ;)
90 minutes and a lot of bettors are happy until kim leveled the score 2-2 for . lol fans be like 
it's not a good day for manchester isit ? lool
fantastic result for & also to have piss away another 2 points utd to continue to underperform under moyes
this man utd side is probably the most overrated in world football currently 
sooo dissapointing :/ 
story of man utds season beat arsenal and draw with cardiff not good enough a lot of work to be done to that team didnr play well 
utd wtf !!!! absolutely useless . .. can't rely on one player all the time .. should be battering teams like this 
well i guess i will delete that sky plus recording straight away 
lol ! rooney should be jailed for this draw not moyes 
 = late in games when manutd defend and the opposition equalize or score the winner
we were lucky to get a draw with that performance 
so thats 10unbeaten games for mufc now !
we drew where other teams found diff to clinch 3 points . failed in marking but we should move fwd . i am more hopeful in ucl than bpl . 
sell fellaini in january please . just a waste of money 
the right idea from rooney but should've took the fucking shot . would've given us the 3 points ! 
welbeck and fellaini are the players that exactly show why we wont win the league ... 
 squander another 3 points . when will the miserable performance end ?
the death penalty should definitely be allowed 
manchester united poor today rooney off , and it would have been worse so glad we didn't buy fellani 
full-time : cardiff 2 united 2 . i am a gift to cardiff to say the least 
we didn't deserve to win , there was just no urgency 
late goal costs united two points . that stings . 2-2 final . 
man utd just get ready for europa league you belong there ! 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
well done , moyes ! well done , boys ! 
fucking hell . should've been ahead by a lot awful defending for the goal . still should've scored twice after that . shite . 
no robin you can't come back . 
massive chance for united rooney should have done allot better with that . good point for cardiff 
of manchester offf
beating arsenal means fuck all now . we're out of it . 
we miss michael carrick so much ! 
didn't deserve to win but frustrating nonetheless 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united "
things are not looking to good for moyes ... 
shocking performance again !!!! 
manutd dn fall ma hand joh .
and that , i'm afraid , is manchester united of today . imagine lining up against fellaini and cleverley . you'd be fucking browning your keks .
never critical but that was poor that 2 pts will bite us
man utd are awful don't know how they managed to win the league last year terrible team rooney needs to join arsenal 
quite clearly , cleverley and fellaini are not the answer in midfield . in fact , neither of them are the answer full stop 
manchester united , living it manchester city's shadow 2013-forever .
we going to cardiff next weekend to go do wha manchester united jus couldn't do . fucking win !!
cardiff deserved that , but our midfield is an absolute fucking disgrace 
this manchester united ... eish !?
can't believe we dropped points at the end smh 
hate manchester united so much , not because of the club but because of the majority of fans are fake
still , unbeaten . we're still on the march at the premier league table . 
evans was poor , valencia fairly transparent , clev mentally lost it while roo regained it , chica nothing , welbz miss firing . ok then . 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
i don't know who will win this league but ofcourse manchester united are not . atleast not by being this fucking inconsistent
cardiff have taken 4 points off of manchester teams this season . can we go there and get all
loooooooooool united you are shit😂 there's only one team in manchester 😂👋👋 cityyyyyy
we didn't play well , probably didn't even deserve 1 point . 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manutd [ campbell , kim - rooney , evra ]
united are lucky to get a draw out of that . c'mon devils , pick up the form ! champions league next week - i have faith ! 
 you fucking disgrace ! knew this would happen :/
shows how dependant on carrick we really are 
betted for a draw , always something i would never do against my own team . and i won 😒 not good enough 
ft : cardiff 2 manchester united 2 it's very frustrating when you lose victory and match ends draw .. but still 1 point . 1/2 
well i'd say it waz the worst performance all season : full time 2-2 cardiff city
keep calm and always support manchester united !
epl - ft score : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united .
didn't deserve to win .. rooney was lucky not to see red and evans was wank !! need to get back to basics lads ! 
see am not jst happy wit dat draw atall 
i support manchester united no matter when~ 
rooney had a bit of a brain fart ! 
when we usually don't play well we grind out the win , but that's the difference this season 
well that was an interesting game , avb in or out ? on a lighter note , time to get drunk in manchester ! 
ft : cardiff 2-2 manchester united .
cardiff ? fuck me we are shocking this season ! 
can't believe ppl knocking rooney for that last play when clearly he was our best player today ...... yet again 
though at the same time we didn't deserve to win either . apart from our back 4 we were awful today we really were . 
don't know what to say about manchester anymore
cardiff out to dent the manchester teams title ambitions
wtf united .. poor defending for the late goal 
we just can't win away games in europe this season ... 
final score > cardiff city - manchester united 2 - 2 ( rooney & evra ) > what a poor result , loosing 2 points like that ... ooh my fucking god !
hahaa manchester united drop even more points .... how things have changed !
what's the different between liverpool and manchester united ? no . nothing .
two goals from manchester united 
that my friends is exactly how we have missed michael carrick . 
epl result : cardiff city 2-2 man united . kim bo-kyung die-minute header save the day for city 
if don't make any key signings in the january transfer window , that's our chances of title chasing gone , possibly even ucl chances too
manchester united who ?
oh what have you done ?! 😡🚶
 fans relax ooh u lucky u didnt loose
man u defense sucks big time 
bo-kyung kim scores a 90th minute equaliser for cardiff to earn a 2-2 draw at home to manchester united 
really mufc ? and wayne for gods sake what was that ??
moyes pls , get the fuck out of manutd .
i love these last minute goals against man united when previously we'd always see them score in the last few minutes 
i swear manutd is shit this season . shit
wonder if that goal by kim bo-kyung will help sell a few cardiff shirts in south korea . manchester united know all about that ( park ji sung )
i hate both cardiff & manchester united so i don't even know how to react 😂
need some big signings in january not good enough at all 
manchester united❤️
another good result !! 
i don't like this being on the receiving end of last minute equalisers lark . 3 points thrown away . 
crazy last minute goal by kim . good game cardiff . giggs you beauty <3 
 thats what happens when they take the foot of the gas and go defensive on a 1 goal lead , need to be killing games of
manchester united still act prestige expecting special treatment ... nooo you didn't renew howard webbs contract
draws are useless .. dropped 2 points a big fuckkkkkkkkk
people gotta stop blaming moyes for manutd playing like shit . they simply have shit players & therefore play like shit ... 
not bad at all , but united shouldn't was the chance from welbo & rooney ..... 
does even want to play football ? looked like he couldn't be bothered . disappointing game all around . 
manchester united just lost me £65 fuck ever betting on them again they've lost me £500 there a joke of a team , they play awful footy
well played cardiff deserved something out of game ... back to the catchup game again 
 ... so there for the taking this season
i knew they had another goal in them ... i think we need another striker ... coz chicharito and welbs can't crack it 
can't say i'm happy with the result , but united didn't play anywhere near well enough . cardiff fully deserve their point . not happy 
really surprising that don't look very good minus carrick and rvp . the crisis is back on ! 
points dropped and i see baines joining united in january now 
that's a deserved point for cardiff there . we sat off way too much and brought the equaliser upon ourselves . valencia had a good game . 
shouldn't of stayed on the pitch after that kick in the first 10 minutes - for 
saw this shit coming 
they deserved a draw but united should be winning them games ! 
exactly not what united needed here . pathetic result , so many missed chances . hope this result doesn't come back to bite us . .
fergie's greatest achievement wasn't 99 or 2008 . it was winning with this current squad at a canter last season . he knew when to quit . 
always say we play bad when we wear blue 😒 
united need to get busy in january ... woeful performance once again 
dissapointing result . our mid looks flat without carrick . 
again denied the victory from a set piece in the dying moments 
fuckin manchester . moyes motherfucker😔
manchester united :( :(
90 ' minute header by kim gives cardiff city the well-deserved draw and point at home against manchester united . joy !! :d
real justice ! 
man of the match , the worst 
manchester united needs to get rid of david de gea and get a quality goalkeeper .. de gea is shiteee !
we do it so often so we've gotta take it when it happens to us i suppose ... 
cardiff deserve all 3 points ! 
rooney how on earth you passesd that ? 😖 could have been a perfect winner !! 
disappointed by that performance
rooney missed out on a golden winner . seriously . how could he miss that 
totally outplayed in midfield but what do you expect with fellaini and cleverley in midfield ? 
am genuinely worried about fellaini though , despite it being early doors . gives the ball away so often and mostly not under pressure 
lol ..... rotfl .... mufc = scale ewu
 ♥
next game is away at bayer .. get ready to see some more howler from us .. they're gonna rape us if we play like today 
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester unoted
why can't they make me happy😔 
let's sleep . so fucking annoyed now . 
so w/o carrick giggsy looks like our best central midfielder .. 
 <3
i don't think 7 points is a relevant margin . why ? because arsenal will not win the league . man city are the team to beat . 
wtf why do man unt doesnt go for more goals untill cardiff scored 
what a missed opportunity ! 
not good enough 
i just love watching any manchester team slip if i'm honest
kim kyung ur goal makes me as sick as ur name !!!! tough times ahead 
need carrick back cleverly is nowhere near as good ! 
sorry but if you want to play striker then you should act like 1 and just smash that chance in not try passing it to wellwank . 
cannot believe that rooney tried to cross the ball instead of taking the shot at end ...! 
this is not the manchester i once knew
midfiled is lacklustre , can't lose points like that .. off to leverkusen now 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
imagine ! allowing kim kardashsian score at d last minute ... smh manutd
epl = english premier league , not gbpl . welsh twats shouldnt even be playing us .. 
undeserved draw . shows how important carrick is ! with cardiff massive spirit in their heart and the fans . shows how weak manutd displayed .
rt if you think david moyes is doing a great job for . !!!
manchester united , everton aren't they ? hahhahahaha loving this weekend !
and we dropped points again , fellaini such a fucking waste of money 
mxm .. needs a wake up call .. how can we draw against cardiff .. that was an obvious win .. dissapointed
love seeing manchester united getting fed their own medicine for once .
if i was like a red tosser now id make up a shit joke like " united fans fancy a holiday ? you cant beat cardiff in november " 
didn't deserve the win tbh , gutted ! 
ugh yas are allowed put the ball in the goal like ... oh well always next weekend ! 
manutd without van persie
win , lose or tied , i'm still a manchester united supporter until my last breath .
the english players are damaging the team ! all shit today !! 
good !! i hope this ends all the title talk . this is an average team . 
abysmal . it is impossible for us to rotate the side . not enough depth to compete . january needs to come quickly 
that's bullshit man ... should've bagged 3 points , what was rooney doing at the end #2pointsdropped 
 defence is a joke and then you got players like cleverly and welbeck who should be in league 1 and fellaini can't defend him anymore
fair result . cardiff city deserved something from the game and manutd could've easily been playing a man down .
koke , alessio cerci should be top priorities 
fellaini is just dreadful . offers nothing . so far since he's signed he's just been a name on the team sheet to make up the numbers . 
disorientation , disorganised , dispassionate , dissatisfied , disappointed that is all 
 shares point with 2-2
full time : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united .
fucking shocking got to give it to cardiff thoe ffs 
hate to say it but some fans are so pathetic it's unreal
ft cardiff 2 manchester united 2 . injury time equaliser for the welsh ! again our midfield exposed . roll on the transfer window . 
didn't deserve to win that . fellaini is really struggling 
no excuses , we didn't do enough to win the game . honestly , we need midfielder that makes the difference . 
my parents aren't normal . texting me from manchester at this time on a sunday evening to say they are now on their way to blackpool ! crazy
a draw for us wow !!! let's bounce back next game boys
fellaini is shit in the position we play him , smalling can't play right back , celeverly is just not good enough and evra is greedy 
 ruining my sunday :-(
united seriously need to purchase 2 good central defender :/ 
 feeling the pain
end game . manchester united 2-2 cardiff city fc
not a happy chap , but will bounce back 
have we gone boring 
we missed van persie and carrick today 
manchester united stay in 6th place but are now 7 points behind arsenal in 1st . 
moyes does it again leaves nanai on the bench , zaha in the reserves and united out on a limb . moyes out 
what a load of shit . 
oh my , we were supposed to be 4th today .. 
this is how we will play under moyes ... proper dog shit and all draws . not saying this on today's game but his overall style of play 
ft : manchester united 2-2 cardiff disappointed but thats the price of moyes playing below average fellaini for 90minutes 
fellaini awful 
if rooney had of got that ball to welbeck . he would missed it anyway 
i hate all football teams but manchester united are overwhelmingly shit
time to hit up some fifa 14 and make manchester united win
don't blame moyes again ! we never lost ! we drew ! blame rooney if you want for not scoring in the 91st min ! some fans make me laugh !
 ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united .
best result ever ; 2-2 ....... i'm soooooo laughin @ manutd ryt nw
ft cardiff 2-2 manutd , what a pathetic result ! so poor .
cardiff city pawang tim manchester ( ? )
and just like that we threw it away .... ! just gotta keep goin on ! 
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united nowonder manuseless fans have all of a sudden gone missin frm my tl !!! hahahahahahaha manure !!!
knew that was coming the moment welbeck spooned that chance . consistently disappoints when needed . 
defending was shit today . got back to basis . 
still unbeaten in 10 games 
draw . it's cool . well played boys ! 
same shit , different day 
cardiff has now officially fucked over the entire city of manchester .
i can't put into words how disappointed/angry i am with right now
keep the faith . 
hate drawing , can't even imagine what it must feel like to be a spurs fan ! 
mufc haha
comic relief has been unusually good this year , hasn't it ? 
wow ! cardiff city draws level with manchester united . much needed result for us arsenal .
manchester failunited
and here we were thinking all the action was over but v proved us wrong !
charming druggies on the tram in manchester lololol
yes , we can score , but we can't defend !! 
bloody hell . should have been 3-2 at least ! oh well ! 
the end of the twelfth tour for manchester united : * play : 12 * win : 6 * draw : 3 * losses : 3 * points : 21 * his goals : 20 * in : 15 
still got faith in them !! 💪
a brilliant lasr minute goal from the . getting a draw against 
its all good !! 
love cardiff's fighting spirit when playing manchester clubs at home , but they should behave next week when we face them
yesterday chelsea won , today pakistan and now manchester united didn't . what a perfect weekend 😎
man united ruined my day .. 
cardiff outplayed manchester united in midfield . fucking embarrassing !!!! i seriously fear 4 our 2014 champions league qualification chances
manutd draw w/ cardiff . exactly what i wished for
told ya , cardiff is hard to beat at home , even both manchester clubs can't win there
we cant blame moyes though too many mistakes from cleverley and the team we played should have hammered cardiff but no 
fuck these manchester united players !! niggas not fighting enough !!
england - premier league ft - manchester city 6 - 0 tottenham hotspur ft - cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united puah hati ..?? -adibtrw-
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
lol lol ... hahahaha lol manchester united football club is turning into a circus ! lol ! soccer though ! lol !
history is the only thing holding manchester united in that 6th position . awful season .
said it earlier this week that i doubt mufc title credentials this season . moyes remains the reason they won't win it .
 are a poor team and the poor investment is telling now . ...
patrice evra you are the captain of and you just stood there and let your man run off you to head the equaliser in . idiot .
marcador final cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united 
so we ( manchester city ) can beat man u 4-1 , and tottenham 6-0 . but we lose 1-0 to sunderland ?! still confused on that .
* reminder : the manchester clubs should forget about the league this season , its between chelsea and arsenal ... rivalry#
point in the bag .. that's what matters ! rooney should of buried that last chance ! 
decent by fellaini . 6th , 7 point off the top . up next , spurs . 
definitely won't win anything this season playing like that . 
fellaini - the most abused mufc player now .
 → manchester united drawing :'(
manchester united are 6th .
again trying to see games out instead of trying to kill it off , 
on the balance of things a draw is better than a defeat and suspension for rooney . midfield very average time to open the cheque book 
yessai ! spurs should beat manchester united next week now ! :') that's what i want for christmas this year .
the majority whining on here about the draw have probably never been near ot .... dont understand what it takes to be a utd red . 
ft : cardiff 2-2 manchester united , a late goal from cardiff prevented united winning . rooney also with a very late chance .
fellaini and cleverley are awful . 
our defense and mid = fucked up really bad .. well played cardiff .. deserved their point , no question .. 
bad to worse . 
manchester united are down to sixth . this whole idiocy caused by david moyes must stop , it's getting annoying .
now im no premier league player , far from it , but is f**kin rubbish , not a man u player for me 
full-time cardiff 2-2 manchester united
the last time cardiff took a point off us we were shit and i collected metal esso football tokens when dad got petrol 
just when manchester united thought they were going to win
great performance from the bluebirds who have now taken 4pts off the manchester teams keep it going lads
is january soon ? 
i've said it before manchester united is finished
if moyes is winning he should practise . time wasting in training why bring on giggs when we have zaha 
pff moyes man .. 
an excellent point for the bluebirds as they come from behind twice to take a share of the spoils . kim bo the hero ! 2-2 
still above man u with a 1/3 of the season gone . 92
smalling fucked up there , simple as . we'll sort it out . 
so is that 3 points gained or lost when man utd beat arsenal 2 weeks ago ? 
arsnel stay no1 28 liverpool stay n0 2 24 chelsea up no 3 24 manchester city no4 24
 trending in 4 - 3 - 2 -1 ha ha tell me i'm wrong .
either i've had too much cough syrup or we played super badly against a former championship side . 
we ve so many players that re not worthy of pulling the manutd shirt .. yet they re called professionals !
applause for cardiff city , two big manchester can't beat them down
fellaini and clevers what a weak centre of midfield . evra sleeping and he's captain ?. rooney bottled it ?? wow 
at least got a point more than city did v cardiff
we're united army n we're always supporting manchester united , no matter win lose or draw
playing like this , we don't deserve a place in the top 6 of the ! can't believe how incredibly bad we played today ! 
cardiff aint shit for snatching the happiness from manchester united like that :) :) :) :) 
100% unbeaten record against the manchester clubs , cachi poeth
england - premier league ( eng ) – premier league full time manchester city 6 - 0 tottenham cardiff 2 - 2 man . united #0le
can't believe manutd drew ! the absence of rvp speaks for itself ! 
lets all have a laugh at manchester united hahahahahhahhaha .. #7pointsbehind
fuck u kim 
we aint gonna win shit with fellaini and cleverley in midfield . simples . 
these unnecessary draws are going to be our downfall this season 
fellaini is not up to speed , how many times did he get caught in possession today ! 
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
how can you be so large , expensive and shit 
wow manchester united you blew it .
in the form he is in and confident mood , rooney should hav just stuck that in rather than passing ! wasnt to be ..... 
2-2 n we we're lucky .. rooney cud o won it ! but hey a draw away isn't 2 bad 
seems like prosecco , jäger and late night karaoke are the cure to jet lag ... unfortunately i now need to drive back to manchester 😖 
yay no 6 yay love love !!!
＃ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
3 texts in as many seconds about result -_- 
next spurs .. bring it on .. niteeeeeee 
we're doing nothing except for losing points this season ! 
exciting match between manchester united and cardiff city ended 2-2 with 4 mins stoppage 
kagawa for cardiff in the final few minutes 
this is the worse ever
astonishingly shit from rooney at the end - an apt microcosm of 's entire performance .
cardiff have never lost to a manchester club think about that for a minute
ft . cardiff city 2-2 manchester united ( campbell 33 ', kim 90+1 ' - rooney 15 ', evra 45') . 
united did not deserve to win the match , but rooney should have won it for us right at the end 
full time cardiff city 2-2 manchester united ( rooney 15 ' campbell 33 evra 45 ' kim 90+1 ' ) 
stupid set piece given away by smalling towards the end & to top it all , really pathetic defending by evra . 
oh well , as i said before , cardiff is a very tough place to go . city and swansea were slain there , after all . fair play to cardiff . 
crappy game , missed opportunity at the end by rooney ... ahh well ...
we're so average . 
manchester united 2-2 cardiff city
feels like a defeat :( ”
manchester united remain distinctly average and that's why england will be too while they still get picked . 
always good when united don't win . 
" justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice justice " 
united need to sort out this defence . cant trust them back there . too many late goals given up . 
if someone comes up with a case supporting tom cleverly , i shall batter their faces in 
ft cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united 
got to be honest didn't deserve the 3 points there 
disappointed shud have won the match ..... comeon how on the earth you can miss that one .... 
good job lads . glory glory manchester united 
manchester united is a mediocre mid table team .... lol
lool kim strikes in fergie time to deny manchester united all three points
ft | cardiff city ( campbell 33 ', kim 90+1 ' ) 2 - 2 ( rooney 15 ', evra 45 ' ) manchester unitedbad game ! bad result ...! 
united aren't out of the title race . no one should rule them out of contention . they're only 7 points off arsenal and 3 off us . 
that was probably a fair result for , still , disappointed that we couldn't hold on for the win ..
united in struggle , united in joy 
cardiff deserved three points another mediocre performance from 
 will always fuck up against small teams . dead club !!!!
this is the manchester united we want . 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 | ggmu 
manchester united beat arsenal & draw to cardiff city . this is so funny haha
i just tire for this manutd team sha ..
ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
fuckin pathetic ! 
 rooney only player who earned his wages today the rest should donate theirs to charity
 really need to invest in their defence
fellaini is actually wank 
manchester united sucks
tertinggal 7 poin dari arsenal . ohh united we love you ... 
poor performance today what exactly are cleverly and fellaini doing ?
back in manchester ! decent weekend with the fam thouh
am so so disappointed with fellaini's performance ... rooney kudos vs 
cardiff is the tormentor of manchester
done really well to get a point out of cardiff . i mean their stadium is like a fortress 
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
aff taya for this manutd attitude oh ... very irritating .
really pathetic .... ... kagawa can play better in cm position than felliani .... goodness me ... need some huge signing in jan ..
arsenal +4 > chelsea arsenal + 6 > manchester city arsenal +7 > manu may life get any better ??
wthh next match manutd vs everton
ft : cardiff 2 - 2 . a pulsating game ends all square as an injury-time header from kim bo-kyung gives cardiff a point
the best we can hope for this season is a top 4 finish . cardiff deserved the draw . another poor performance 
cardiff were much the better side and got a well deserved point , we were shocking in defence but we're manchester united we'll bounce back !
we’ll never die , we’ll never die we’ll keep the red flag flying high ‘ cos man united will never die 
get in cardiff !! 
final en inglaterra cardiff city 2 ( campbell y kim ) - manchester united 2 ( rooney y evra ) 
 just drew with ... 
is southampton still above manchester united ?
manchester united < if the cast of glee made a first xi
some players ought not to play for 
to be fair united didn't deserve to win that game , but that was shit defending at the end 
today really magnifies what we need in january , time to step up glazers 
i really dissapointed to manchester united , why draw again ?
moyes i hope you get sacked in the morning 
this one goes in the same drawer as shaktar , sociedad away and southampton home . labelled " games we should have won but drew " 
tough loss . now it's time to leave that in the past and focus on wednesdays champions game . 
thank you cardiff city & manchester united . good game .. :-)
money don enter bush oooo . cardiff fucking drew manchester united . fucks .
sad to get a point but still 10 games unbeaten 
nice one cardiff city , and are 7 points behind leaders . balance is restored to the universe , all is right again . 
still going to be manchester clubs top two
apparently we were to believe that there was a comeback eeh manchester united ???
spurs next for mufc
well done , manchester united . now you're 7 points behind arsenal .
i hate it when manutd play last
soft centre costs us again . never got hold of the game . it needs fixing quickly . 
 fecha 12 cardiff city 2 ( campbell 33 ', bo-kyung kim 90 ' ) 2 manchester united ( rooney 15 ', evra 45 ' )
what matters now is the 3 point . i'm sure manchester united can do it next match against tottenham .
what a dire performance today from utd . no passion and sloppy play . so poor in midfield . cleverly is shite . fellani is shite . roll on jan 
good week for after draw v everton still 2nd in the prem . lol @ 
like what the fuck is wrong with manutd , just to hold a simple 2-1 lead for like 4 mins . thanks for ruining my weekend once again
slightly frustrating . 
mufc had no control in midfield against cardiff . good thing is carrick is out for a while , and no-one in squad can do the job . scholes ?
smalling was a complete shit today .. fellaini show how moyes waste 32 fucking million .. 
all about perceptions . narrative around involves poor transfer activity and struggle under a new manager . they're 10 unbeaten .
fair result between and .... so after a day of watching tv now off to get some live entertainment 
manchester united will not finish in the top 4 this year .
 rooney 1 on 1 with the keeper and he tries to give it welbeck ?
manchester united . lol
ft| cardiff city 2 - 2 , what a superb match
we didnt play very well today and a very strange team coiice and substitutions . rooney shoulda had a shot instead of trying to pass 
that south korean dude from cardiff city just scored a friggin equaliser goal against mufc in an injury time . no ! this is can't!> . <
well , that sucked 
a south korean comes to the rescue for the welsh club with a malaysian owner against the club from manchester owned by americans . 
all we can do is expect better performances 
i wonder how long we can actually stay patient with shaky form . fergie done fine with those same exact players last year ..
rip manchester united
tom cleverley needs to gtfo out of old trafford . 
it's not the first time we concede the equaliser in the dying minutes , we should stop defending a one goal lead from now on . 
good job moyes , good job manchester united 
since when do shut up shop at 2-1 &try & hold what we have got , never , only since moyes came in , its not the utd way
termina el partido entre cardiff city 2-2 manchester united . resultado que nos conviene . 
manchester city ......... ....
horeee seri !! dolly dolly manchester united !!
motd will be wonderful tonight 😁 *rs 
 won , won , lost , lost and lost . that is perfect weekend !
a 2-2 draw with cardiff . only united would suck so bad . 
draw ? manchester united well never die !! 
garbage from united , could barely string two passes together all game and got what we deserved . what exactly does fellaini do ? 
have it you cunts ahhhhh 
we should be winning games like this 
 just not good enough . how many times this season has moyes tried to defend a lead & it back fired ,
lol to all mufc fans rite nw
thought we'd won it . oh well . on to the cl .. 
lol manchester united just lol
how bad was that today ?? 
go on , test my patience 
ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
well that was shit .. 
ft manchester city 6 - 0 tottenham hotspur ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united komentar mu ...?? abie cibiru
but have to accept that we didn't deserve to win tonight !! without carrick we lack stability & creativity !!! tough times ahead 
another disappointing performance & result . moyes needs to rediscover our killer instinct . we've lacked a ruthless edge for 2 years . 
another point towards safety 
hahaha tottenham and manchester united both dropped points today .
my wife and kids is funny ... only fools and horses is hilarious ... but are on a different level lol !! 
silly silly silly football manchester united . so disappointed right now .
referees don't favour manchester united , referees are just generally terrible .
theres no point beating arsenal and then dropping points against cardiff , poor performance 
 is that you ? again draw :d 
welbeck should've scored . rooney should of scored . what happened ? drawn against a team of low life's 
why :'( 
simple as this , we get two quality midfielders in january or we aren't doing anything this season 
ft : manchester united 2-2 cardiff 
shit play get a new cb a real class cm !!!!!!!!
 2-2 united , & late drama strikes once again . kim was d man to get d equaliser , and it was no less than cardiff deserved
and mufc failed to to achieve top4 spot .... lol !
really need a strong personality in that midfield that can dictate a game 
not good enough . 
fellaini and cleverley are just not good enough , need a world class cm 
rooney need to sometimes plays selfishly ... what a pass that was by giggs ... but anyways rooney was outstanding again 
give up ! we need big changes ! 
oh ffs !! why didnt rooney shoot !? im afraid to say this season is going to be very very different !! cant deny played well
on to the next game . 
 so disappointed
happy these teams dropped points . 😜
fuck you mufc 
europa league welcomes manutd with open arms at the end of this season !
 players just don't run anymore , no energy , no desire , no winning mentality . what's different from last season ?? hmmm
while city snubs past 6 against spurs we draw against cardiff 
simply not good enough . well moody now . 
moyes doesn't deserve 2 b a manutd manager nd som players in dat team
threw those points away . 
24/11/2013 
cardiff draw to mufc i'm done
fellaini is a waste of money defense is a waste of space 
manchester united , tottenham hotspur >>>> hahahahaha ..... :p
haha man utd ! is blue !
rooney , welbeck both missed very very good chances in the end . should have been 3 pts 
again i question what fellaini does other then give away free kicks ? 
there norr , lyk ants being forced out with an insecticide spray , the haters are coming out from their holes . still 
manchester united football club still
so neither manchester team could win away to cardiff but we did , and mackems slagged us for being botom after 2 games 
same shit again . welbeck could've sealed , smalling is a liability at right back and missing chances costing us points . 
we need serious midfielders . .
lol welldone manchester united hahahaha good day ! great day !
we used pick up max points at d death b4 but now everything seems to have changed 
glory glory manchester united (^_^)​​(y )
a points all we deserved , uninspired and decidedly average from midfield was pedestrian no imagination
6th in table .. spurs are not a threat , saints will falter ( hope ) bt ever wont .. city , liv , arse , chel top 4 .. top 5 looks tough
top 5 : 1 . arsenal 2 . liverpool 3 . chelsea 4 . manchester city 5 . southampton .
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
why manchester united dey like do me like vera so ?!..
why did we draw cardiff ? 😔😔😔 
manchester is blue 
manchester united what did you do ?.. smh
i'm a retired manchester united fan , 
waiting for all the plastic fans wanting .. if you can't support mufc when they lose/draw , don't support them when they win .
final del partido en el cardiff city stadium , 2-2 
people stop what you are doing and laugh at manchester united and when ur done with them laugh a little more at spurs 
pressing game from cardiff was very impressive , didn't let utd dictate the play . carrack was missed in that respect . 
next match : bayern leverkusen vs manchester united | thursday , nov 28 2013 | kick off 03:00 wib | live ! sctv
we are manchester united
manchester united fans in medical school are the funniest i ve ever seen . counting ur chicks before they are hatched . ( 1/3 )
we'll never die 
long old season this is gonna be thanks moyes 
fuck sake . despite being so poor , should've put that game to bed long ago . just invited pressure . 2 points dropped . royally pissed . 
we can not afford to drop points anymore ! but we will always fight the challenges ! 
following today's performance i think the whole of mufc should swap to taekwondo , apart from wellbeck who couldn't hit a fucking barn door .
manchester city decided to riot on tottenham , that wasn't fair☹ lool sorry spurs
how many seasons is welbeck going to get fluffing chance after chance . why doesn't stay after training and fucking practice finishing ! 
fuck sake why cant we finish games off ?! 
sucks to concede goals last minute . after all the time we've inflicted this pain on other clubs . 
was so amped about this f1 race even forgot was playing ..
felling bad for mufc ... :
good game manchester united 
hahah serves manchester united right . rooney should never have been on the pitch .
absolutely bollocks . ridiculous 
cardiff city vs manchester united 2-2
4pts from 6 against the manchester teams for cardiff .. 
wtf just happened 
cardiff city .. breaking both manchester club's fan's hearts since 2013 .. keh3
filing x bah -_- " m . united till die 
i think it's important to get some defensively minded players in january . 
 
i don't wanna hate on moyes , but what the actual fuck just happened ... 
better luck next time 
id rather have anderson play than cleverley 
mid-table shite 
 
manchester united _|_
onto the next ..... 
wei ... manchester unitf ada game sekarang !! okey , haza please say " no , cause you have physics paper tomorrow !!"
similar united performance to the one in donetsk in the cl . surrendered possession too easily and constantly invited pressure . 
full time | cardiff city-manchester united 2-2 .
manchester's christmas markets seem to bring out everyone's love of littering .
hahaha wankers , spurs can beat cardiff and both manchester clubs can't waaaayyyyyyy
wow lmao manchester united tied with cardiff city :o 
absolute pathetic . can we please play like champions for gods sake ? we're champions !! 
proteas loose , man utd draw .. we will bounce back in the next games 
ft : cardiff 2- 2 manchester united 
utter despair ! conceding another last minute goal . need to work harder . missing carrick in midfield . 
full time : manchester united-2 vs cardiff-2
fellani is the most useless player to have play for manchester united , what a lazy guy
cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united . empate amargo para los 
hahahahahaha manchester united draw !!! wuuuuhuuuuu !! hope to beat cardiff next weekend 
keep glory-glory manchester united !!
manchester united have change lot
okayla . manchester united in 6th position pun okay . but still need to push more .
this manchester united team are a very poor one compared to previous seasons .
lol tbh manchester united can be 6th position for all i care , but i can bet anything that arsenal is not winning any trophy this season
message to dog owners . never let a manchester united player walk your dog as they can't hold on to the lead .
and here i thought manutd won d league 2weeks ago when they beat arsenal @ ot . false dawn ehn .
nothing better than and spurs dropping points
we fucking dogged a bullet with ! thank god we didnt get him ! 
that wasnt even necessary patrice evra 
mufc fans atm : roaring : moyes out ....
just seen a liverpool fan tweet - " and that's why you're 7 points below us !!" liverpool have 24 points . manchester united have 21 points .
ft : cardiff 2-2 man utd . all the pressure that put paid off . dropped what they will see as easy points away . 
i also have absolutely no fucking idea how moyes doesn't play anderson ! me personally think he is one of our best midfielders 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
welbeck , cleverley fellani , young and valencia are not players & moyes is not a good manager 
seriously , what was with all that sloppy moves during the last few minutes ? could have been 4-2 in a flash . terrible loss 
im just wondering how many fans will tweet me pics of the league table this weekend . a team clearly on the decline . 
 play a pathetic brand of football . no cohesion , very disjointed & lack of desire/self belief . poor display 
personally i think united and city should merge together and be called manchester city
atleast one manchester team didn't lose against cardiff !
we stil got a point tho .. which is we aint going back 
just when i was celebrating 's win , vettel(1 ) and webber(2) , concedes ... what a painful draw !
i'm from manchester i can say that manchester is blue ! united are just old news now ...
hehehe . drew , got smashed , are top ! not a bad weekend , to be fair :p
final score : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united 
we will be back ...!! 
i fucking love football . 
good game manchester united ... ft mu 2-2 cardiff malaysia
how could a short korean guy score that where he was surrounded by tall defenders -_-
nevermind , 
not a bad day . get to see get demolished , then watch drop points to cardiff . 
poor spurs :-( ft : manchester city 6-0 spurs !!!
im so happy i support arsenal now . although i might have to go back to manchester city . 6 goals you know .
woeful again . 
so pissed off with that…thrown 4 points away from set pieces in the 90th minute… . deserved to win but we can’t win the league like this 
need carrick back cleverly is soo shit 
tough fixtures coming up for manchester united .... i hope we can play well and get our season back on track ..... 4ever
moyes proving that he could take any premier league club to 6th 4ever 
 
we had two more chances to get that 3rd goal in ... oh well , at least we didn't lose 
looooooooooool ! that manutd match was so sweet that i almost got diabetes
don't give up say glory-glory manchester united
ah , we drew with cardiff ? dang . and city scored 6 ?! hmmmm . buck it up 
 moyes out !!
had a great weekend !! 
utd's midfield is shocking ! some serious work needs to be done in january ! 
ft| cardiff 2-2 united : we weren't good enough ... though many have come here and lost , can't say i'm happy with the point . "
tom cleverley gets worse with every appearance . hate getting down on the players but cleverley is an absolute cone . 
everyone slagging uniteds position off , they're 1 point off citeh , 7 points off top , not the worst position . both manchester clubs need to
different story in manchester .
cardiff city vs manchester united 2-2 😂 david moyes 
disappointed , manchester united should've taken that . why the fvxk didn't rooney shoot ?? and why is evra captain ?? we need baines .
still be a red army ! 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united : 3 
with city humiliating spurs with a 6 goal rout !!!! united should hav wrapped up 3 points in wales !!!! 
why the hell has he squared that ?! poor performance in general . # mufc
a deserved result for cardiff , so continue training for . but remember the premier is not won by only beating . ask aston v .
27m for fellaini , let that sink in 
good game lads ! 
on the way home , glad to see the back of manchester
cardiff city 2-2 
united in my heart 
that's what happens when you play to not lose instead of playing to win conservative didn't ever try to kill off & paid price
ft : cardif city 2 vs 2 manchester united
oh yes , i'm sticking and will always stick by the team alright , but not with moyes ' stupid team selections and substitutions . 
anyone in the prem would be ecstatic taking 4 points from the two manchester clubs . so proud of my boys 
hey , cardiff is a good team in this season . at least we got a point . 
cardiff a tough place to go . out of the manchester teams only one of them got anything
that was bollocks 
man , fellaini is seriously pushing soldado for worst signing of the summer . hell he might have already won it . 
could see that coming to be fair 
here we go let everyone slate moyes again , let's just forget what what happened to pellegrini the other week 
bad night , just got one point before ucl match against leverkusen . brake ' em legs ! 
that match could have been 4-2 . okay 3-2 if rooney hadn't had a brain fart . 
come on stop embarassing all your fans !!
manchester united .. lol
it was a blue day 4 d blue side of manchester n red 4 d red side of manchester ... true representation of colors
loving this cardiff side , they seem to have a habit of screwing manchester sides . :) 
wazza cud hv easily been my motm but for dat last minute loss of concentration 
cardiff seems to be full of man u supporters who failed to grow out of supporting manchester united on the playground . how odd .
ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united . still love 
poor manchester united . lol
disappointing night ... nkt 
all what i want from united is to be the top 3 in the 
poor performance . no pressure , no plan , no fluency and still should've it won late on . not even slightly surprising either . 
fuck it man idc we may have bottled it but at least we got a point ! bayer on wednesday and spurs next week bring it on ! 
good job guys ! 
hmmmm ... tottenham better redeem themselves this weekend ... cant accept manchester twacking back to back
how more timid and indecisive can you be moyes ! cleverley+useless felliani in the heart of midfield ! u av jones ! you moron ! 
frustrerende ! #2pl
wazza why the fuck dint you shot 
normal service resumed . 
why does every united fan put ' ' after every single tweet about them !!
5 great films at 2013 and poetry at miramar with friends . manutd dropped points and spurs got a lesson . a sunday was had by all .
thankyou verymuch my god and thankful myclub : * although the same score but manchester united have given the best o: )
cardiff 2-2 manchester united .. a hard point earned , dropping us to 6th on the table . 
how many times 
well , some poor performances out there today , tough place to go but a couple of big points dropped . what went wrong ? 
buto city lose to cardiff tak bising , manutd draw and everyone lose their mind fakkof haters
no passions , no willing , no chance for 3 points lads 
atleast we've extended unbeaten run to 10 matches lol 
the team was getting better every week , but this week we slipped . hope we win all the remaining matches in the first round . 
playing without a centre midfield is killing us this season . poor quality when we have the ball . the squad needs an overhaul . 
that game was annoying as heck 
nice playing manchester united !
conceding a goal at such a time .... i leave our team in god's hands now . 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united haha . 6
all i know manutd will be top four b4 end of the year
damn this was the match to catch up with the top four ! 
is it scary that we make stupid subs in every game now ? 
so manchester united drew ? cool ! fuccin cool !!
oya fans of tym to talk . we'd just do the listening , guess a point is not too bad na .
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united ( campbell , kim - rooney , evra ) 
oh wonderful , just wonderful ..... 
manchester united just has its way of ruining my good times
all respect to cardiff but what the hell are we doing dropping points against cardiff 
double bitter pill to swallow today with & 
draw is the best gift from manchester united
that's a point gained i think . didn't really derserve anything . lucky to come away with a draw 
typical of us this season ! why didnt rooney just lob marshall ! poor result 
win , lose or draw , manchester united till i die ! 
worst performance all season 
who are that bunch of useless boloxes wearing utd shirts 
medel should have been sent off too he was the reason why that free kick was retaken which lead to the goal 
to be honest , i'm pissed but not really angered . city did lose here with their full team . we definitely missed carrick and rvp today . 
fellaini just running around the pitch like some headless poultry . ft : cardiff 2 - mufc 2 .
remembering the days we had a midfield . sad . saying goodbye to the title 
naaa naa i'm soo pissed off ! like rooney wtf i love you init butt bury that last chance ! ⚽️ 
we shldn't b splipping pts in games lyke dis buff~
ahh sudahlah .. bad signal from the start . glory glory manchester united ..
what on earth was rooney thinking ! might aswell have knocked it back to de gea instead of that donkey ! 🙈⚽️ 
don't understand why rooney didn't shoot , fuming ! 
spurs next and then everton . i'm sure we'll drop more points . we should have fucking won this . 
i actually wanted mufc to be 8pts behind but 7pts isn't bad right ?
should've gotten the win ... a point better than none 
disappointing way to start my sunday 
smalling/fellaini/chicharito/giggs .. should these lot be playing in arguably 1 of the best clubs in world football in 2013 , seriously ? 
why did rooney not shoot there ? should have . 
we the real manchester united fans are grateful for this result . \= d/
my thoughts and prayers go out to tottenham , as today there was a mass raping of them by the hands of manchester city ....
we really do need to beat manchester united next . so we can not look as much as a laughing stock ..
thank god i have football manager to sell and buy the right players 
moyes is a cunt 
why always manchester united
i think the inevitability of that equaliser is the most worrying thing from perspective .
manchester united 6th ... 😟 not cool !!! not just cool !!!
well with waiting till the last min of the transfer window for that big haired useless prick so you could say i'm a little pissed off 
cleverley as well aint good enough to play for west ham let alone united kmt 
cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united
this manchester fucking joke !
ft cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
haha manchester united😃 
cardiff like to fuck with manchester teams .
we really should have earned those 3 points but l will take that 1 point 
couldn't be more p*ssed right now !!! arghhhh 
what the fuck was rooney doing 
just don't talk to me after today's result 
so many so called fans on here fucking hell . all they do is criticise 
i really doubt manchester united will finish in top 4 
manchester united 2-2 cardiff 
but to get so close & then not win is really disappointing . and we got 2 golden chances to win and blew them even after the equaliser . 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united . whatever be the result , it's not the end of the road . 
we have to beat tottenham next week . no excuses , that performance today was mediocre 
leos and all blacks had set the tone for the weekend then mufc wakaamua tu waharie jersey . anyway a point it is , better than none 
jeez ! and man u did not win this match . mstchew 
don't understand the hatred for is it just jealousy ?! i'm through and through so don't care about them either way . y do others ?
😅😅🔫😴 
we desperately need a new midfield . januzaj is the only bright spark we have there . 
biast or not but the ref should not of let them retake that freekick with the foul on fellaini 
bring di maria & garay to manchester red ! plis plis plis
i'm actually crying 
not good enough united need to get 2-3 players in january and defiantly a midfielder not good enough without michael carrick mu muf mufc ok
tottenham vs manchester united next week sunday ! another draw
so we get a draw , wat the fuck smh !!!! unfuckenbelievable
until we get two quality midfielders and a leading defender we are doomed 
ft manchester city 6 - 0 tottenham hotspur ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
rocky performance , hard one to take again especially like that , unlucky by wazza but without him we would have lost today 
so we played cardiff who beat city and then spurs who were thumped by city . we were thumped by city . anyone fancy the odds ?? 
cardiff have 4 points out of a possible 6 at home against both manchester teams . i take that ! 
music to my ears the angry manutd fans on my tl ♪
well the good news is marouane fellaini is suspended for 's next game !!! 
well we got a point our performance deserved . played very poor and would have been lucky to win today . 
fuck manchester united hahahaha bien fait !!!! 
2-2 , is that what is all about now ? manchester united came , saw & drew ! cardiff 2-2 manchester united|and let twitter talk begin…
oh plzzz manchester united cardiff shouldn't win
we are backing david moyes defo ... but its getting a bit stupid holding on every game for points - 
ft : cardiff city 2 vs 2 manchester united
another frustrating day , think we did enough to take 3 points though 
it's okay because my dallas cowboys are going to fuck the giants up later on . that'll make up for yet more disappointment .
ft cardiff 2-2 man utd .. and " fergie time " being a problem for moyes right now .. 
i am aware of the geographical irony of that last tweet , but there is the existing context of historical influence 
watching mufc is torture this season . am so dismayed at how we play the game now ! 1 step forward , 2 back at the mo ! worrying times !!!
sell fellaini and young in this january transfer . both of them are useless . 
i keep saying it and will always do ... david moyes ' is not the man for he has no football identity
we should've have won with the chances we had 
cardiff deserved draw . very poor by manchester united . no carrick = no direction . evans and cleverley should look to join mid-table clubs .
cardiff city 2 - man utd 2 played ok today , nothing more , so i guess a draw was fair 👿 we all know cardiff are dangerous on set pieces 
fuck sake that last chance for rooney , he could've buried it , but he chose to pass when he should've been fucking selfish 
i'm still in shock at rooney trying to square the ball to welbeck when it was easier to shoot and score . 
look at these arses slating united again . no , moyes shouldn't be out . just need to get the transitional period out of the way 
knew the international break would disrupt the run of games we had anyways time to pick it up again 
it's quite evident that cunt fc aka is a whore team ... !! shove that up urselves !
said it once and i'll say it again , as far as are concerned its a consolidation year , rebuild in the summer
it's still only a draw it's not 6 ( see what i did there 
english premier league | full-time : cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united - campbell 33'/ kim bo-kyung 90'+1 ' | rooney 15'/ evra 45 '
a day of 2-2 draws it seems 
manchester is sky blue , lets face it 
use winter transfer window 
betfair loves to sheg manchester united and it annoys me so much
forever fans .
no vidic . no carrick . no van persie . we got a point away from home . 
in we still trust !!!
1 point from cardiff city stadium . 10 match united unbeaten . 
our mates are beating their mates 6-0 we are here drawing ... still love my team 
paul scholes could sit at home in his arm chair and still pass the ball better than fellaini and cleverly .. 
manchester united . nothing left to say .
sokay manutd . better luck next timeee
manchester united ........ 
no cardiff , just no ! wtf 
can some one explain what cleverley & fellaini offer a team ? absolute garbage . don't get me started on welbeck . haha 
pathetic time for carrick to be out . spurs and everton away coming up . 
thoughts on the game/performance then ? best comments in tomorrow's paper 
gutted !!!! we should have bagged this one . can't blame the coach on this one . the players need to raise their game 
well that was a load of shit , played like cunts for 90mins . move on now to midweek 
i take it back . lost it in midfield all day long . 
wat a terrible night ..... waiter 3mo 4 th road .
not bad for tottenham . at least they go to the smaller team in manchester next week
fellaini is a dullard , dulls manutd's game badly !
did cardiff just win the league ?? oh no .. just drew with utd !!! 
now manchester is blue . not just for film exactly .
moysey time ; conceding in stoppage time ........ 
having a midfield consistently made up of the likes of fellaini , cleverley and a 40 yr old giggs is a travesty . 
fellaini is an absolute shocking footballer . should never , ever play for manchester united again . 
cardiff tied it up at the end there . final 2-2 and . 
i am not usually one to criticise our players but fellani is woeful . he looks out of place 
manchester united are rubbish , such a let down⚽️💔
love manchester
to be honest would have took a point at the start ! cardiff is a tough place to go ! but we still should have won by a few ! #20 #20
cardiff have scored five goals at home against the manchester sides .
that game was the difference between 4th place and 6th place ! at least we're moving up the table 
twice we have conceded late on from set plays . avoid that and we would be 2nd 3 points behind arsenal . 
don't blame moyes . just look at those misses from welbeck and rooney 
players like medal & mutch needed at manchester united instead of cleverly fellaini !
it so what it is ! we'll bounce back , always do 
awful weekend of sport 
as city buttfuck spurs , we draw with cardiff . where's the fucking midfield ? 
get well really soon michael carrick ... please . 
but wait its not . coz of mufc .
i have no confidence or faith in this team at all 
 is the most disappointing on the pitch for now . 
the composure and calmness brings was missing ... fellaini needs to seriously up his game 
i dont think i've ever seen a worse centre-midfield pairing in a big team than fellaini-cleverley .. absolutely shit performance 
8 of 11 players don't deserve to be on united side . 
definitely 2 points lost there , shouldve been in that top 4 tonight . still a long time left in the season . let's not lose momentum . 
manchester united's dropped points see them miss the chance to go into fourth in the premier league table .
more dropped points , hope we can financially cope without european football 
were champions yet no one is scared to play us , we lack someone to grab the game and control it ! midfield non existent , so poor 
well .. win , lose , or draw , believe we shall still . nicely fought , malaysia . err i mean , cardiff city . 
 2-2 played a great game . c'mon up your game ! you dropped 2 points .
win , lose , draw . 
that's how mid table teams are . they nick a lucky win over top teams and show their real character amongst themselves . hahahaaha 
what on earth was rooney thinking not striking that 
similar sentiments in manchester tonight . man city won by 6-0 man utd did not win from cardiff .
time to prepare a few " fuck yous " disguised as sarcastic responses to the manchester united result ....
super fail united . i'm losing hope in football now . 
yooo ... that's a draw for the manchester utd .. well done cardiff city !! :) 
i wish we would stop wearing that idiotic blue shirt ... bad karma . cardiff was wearing our colors . 
 haha
i knew it !! 
manchester united . smallest team in manchester . 
cardiff the king of comeback . manchester united the king of loser .
cardiff 2-2 manchester united . now i know what it feels like to concede in ' fergie time '. good support from the fans today . 
pathetic . 
manutd ( fergie ) trying to help england ... welbeck n cleverly ... spoiling their chances
it was 2 points dropped .. we must buy loads of midfielders .. :-\ i'll be happy if we finish in top 4 this season .. 
well the only place we can go from today's performance is up 
last minute agony x 2 
mufc❤️
 seems to hv lost their invisible shield that they r now a " beatable " team instead of a team others hv to be afraid of . just my thought
i'm calm :) 
everton's chairman should be applauded , stole £ 27.5 m from manutd and then passed on moyes so he could get martinez
that's good i hate manchester united anyway ! well done cardiff !! :d
manutd fans are back in their hole
typical . 
no matter what we all know whos going to win the league at the end 
" winter is coming " for david moyes and manutd 
i miss , i miss , i miss . could be worse could be . players through that away not the manager
premier league : arsenal 28 pts chelsea 24 liverpool 24 manchester city 22 southampton 22 man united 21 everton 21 newcastle 20 tottenham 20
 vs ' next weekend . neither moyes or avb can afford to lost , or even draw that . that's a huge game .
unfollow spree indeed , fucking racist pricks , you have shamed manchester united
we need to buckle up ! 
i knew they would tie it up once welbeck and giggs came in ... the transfer window can't get here any faster ! 
manchester united , there . acting the daft cunt to perfection . we're always here for you , football . always .
so many players need to leave man utd if we're going to get back to winning ways : ferdinand , cleverley & welbeck , to name a few . 
disappointing draw for manutd ! 😔
david moyes has a face that looks like he has just found his daughter in bed with one of his players 
manchester city swept back into the prem league's top four after humiliating title rivals tottenham hots 6-0 at the etihad stadium on sunday
nice one cardiff ;) 
felt manchester united lost that match .
i will run down my road in y fronts if manutd ever win the league this year
still trying to work out what rooney was trying to do with his chance at the end there 
my feet have hurt constantly since the day i moved to manchester . 
this going to be a long painful season for 
we don't hv any miedfielder . fellaini is a big waste of money 
win  or lose  . im still a 100% since day uno a manchester united fan .  
ft cardiff city 2 - manchester united 2
what is a manchester united ?
haha a girl called kim just scored against manchester united .... that's my take on things anyway ! 
fair score cardiff 2 v 2 man . utd . well done game lads and unlucky today . keep support 
will manchester united make it to the champions league next year ? 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united goals by : campbell , kim | wayne rooney , evra
if available , carrick , jones , rvp , vidic , shinji , and rafael may all have started this one .. standard injury list at the moment 
great day for the blue half of manchester 
manutd survive ... they must be happy to walk away with a point !
fair result imo but our season is not over i'm positive the top 4 teams will lose a few games along the way to and we will capitalise ! 
and fans that say unbeaten in 10 can fuck off we have been shit all fucking season 
january can't come quick enough . woodward and moyes need to get their act together and get some decent midfield options in 
 cardiffian !! 
just can't hold a lead anymore :-( 
average manager and too many average players 
well done manchester :)
and again , manchester united finds a way to disappoint me . at least we didn't lose . at the very least .
fellaini has been so poor since he joined , getting bullied off the ball so easy its embaressing 
manchester united sucks so much ....
mufc fans used to get excited in the last 5 minutes of fergie time , its time to get nervous in the last 5 minutes & name it moyes time 
manchester is ours ! man city !!!!
what a load of shit worst performance of the season !!
great day for the only team in manchester xxxxxxx
tottenham and manchester u will play next week ..... i hope nobody goes to watch them .... both are shit this season ..
still love united 
without carrick and rvp , were completely out of sync .
we need to beat spurs next weekend 
can we please get rid of some deadwood soon and bring in some quality players ? so much garbage in this squad .
 its sad .....
fellaini and cleverly got to be the worst pairing in the history of manchester united . embarrassing
can't take a year of this 
probably would of won if rvp was playing ... 
lol manchester united at it again !!!
i hate everton for allowing fellaini and david moyes to leave . piss off , both of you . 
everyone laugh at and hahaha 
 u need a new fucking coach right now !
times up for cleverley , been given plenty of chances . simply not good enough to play in our midfield . 
easy points dropped yet again ! 
if arsenal finishes on 19th then manchester united will be just behind in 20th .... no way moyes will topple arsene this term .
you can't win the league when you've got welbeck , jones , smalling , cleverley , smalling and young , 6 6 
feel the ref knew rooney shouldn't be on the pitch so felt the need to compensate for the full 90 . disappointing . 
not at all happy with the result .. need to buckle up .. 
if it was up to me id have powell back off loan to play rather than cleverley 
justice !!! 
kaizer chiefs & manchester united :(
someone remind rooney this is man utd , not barca . he should have been a bit more selfish . 
 is trending again why ? cause of a draw ? joke fans 
if united want to stay in the title race , we need to spend big in january !!! 
fellaini and cleverly in midfield is as bad as it gets , can't be surprised about dropping points when we have such a shocking midfield 
7aram . walla 7aram ! we could've gone to 4th place 
cleverley - sell young - sell ferdinand - retire fellani - kick up the arse needs 2 center mids 1 left back 1 centre back 1 right b 
 all other top 5 teams wins , united loose
a draws a draw , but should of finished it off . no onto another tough two away games 
some of our players are not united quality . 
cardiff city vs manchester united 2-2 
even though it's chilly in wales you can't beat cardiff this time of the year ! 
full time : cardiff 2 - 2 manchester united 
ya neh like when draws !!!
haha everyone says united supporters only get a voice when they win .... the haters only get a voice when we don't! 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united . sokayy man united ... 
i've never ever seen a man utd team so weak like it's this season .. but we did missed rvp , vidic , jones & carrick today !! 
 gotta love it 
next match is against spurs at white hart lane .. that wont be easy especially when we are playing like shit 
fellaini and cleverly , the 2 things i never want to see together in 's midfield again
sitting back , inviting pressure for 45 minutes , too negative yet again ! 
manutd forever , manutd till i die
i think thought it was park and that is why he let him go . the red shirt completed the confusion - 2 2 
manchester is blue !
ft : 2 ( campbell , kim ) man united 2 ( rooney , evra ) - draw takes 6th on 21 points , 7 behind leaders 
disappointing , it was inevitable with the way we were playing . 
the jealousy people have on man utd is real 
next macth liga champion away ke leverkusen 
freekick or corner are problems for united ...... 
in fairness welbeck should put game to bed when 2-1 up .. 
that was poor , it's cardiff ffs . 
down to number 6 . deserve it too . we've been so inconsistent this season . 
mid field woes exposed again ... time to shell out money for a creative cm ... ...
liverpool ( 3 ) - ( 3 ) everton . city ( 6 ) - ( 0 ) sp*rs . cardif ( 2 ) - ( 2 ) manutd * lol * ( 2 ) - ( 0 ) soton 
full time : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
can someone please please please remove that bug eyed prick from manchester united . please
in moyes we trust 
manchester for new year :d
rio please just go now you've done enought rubbish 5 
united never been so f*cking weak ! bring back fergie 
here we go with united fans slating certain players . we need to accept that as a team , we're shite atm . another sloppy performance ! 
manchester united had to be the ones to ruin my day didn't they ! bye £525 .. 
cardiff have collected 4points from the 2 manchester clubs this season .
i blame rooney for that last minute chance he should have just dribble pass the keeper that useless warri boy is a waste 
manchester united who ? moyes who ? 7pts difference !!!
i'm actually salty af that manchester united is in the top4 rn
fellaini + cleverly in midfield bad combination 
chris smalling noob ! mother fu ... .
well fact is , both manchester teams weren't capable of defeating cardiff this year .
 all i can say is fuck
watching man city in sublime form and then watching no doubt which is the better team , chances of winning the bpl gradually fading imo
well done lads ... 
keep calm and always love 
next 3 matches in epl ... tottenham-everton-newcastle ... 
cardiff did to manchester united what manchester united used to do to others . karma .
where did manchester united go man ?
27million for fellaini what were we thinking ! useless 
welcome back , ! 
 giving up so many chances these days . in previous seasons some teams would be lucky to have one sniff at goal , never mind 14 shots
we need to sign players 
truly frustrated ! we could've won but we didn't take the chance to kill the game off 😪👎 
in moyes we rust 
got a cute red christmas jumper with a penguin in a scarf today for £18 gosh love 
final - cardiff city 2-2 manchester united ...
 
is this a fucking joke ? 
whose error was there in last goal ? 
just not good enough 
i think manutd can pass this moment with a little smiles . so we're manutd fan must be patience to see our club back to the line of champ ....
 evra you should as well scored an own goal instead of watching kim run pass you in the box on the 90th min ... poor man
if tom cleverley didn't come through the academy , he wouldn't be anywhere near our squad . 
now i blame moyes .. late subs n all smh 
win , lose or draw . united till i die 
welbeck is a bad omen . how many games have we won that he has played ? nani should have come in instead of him . 
late drama strikes once again from a very tight premier league game ! 
 blows it in the last 5 minutes , 2 more games to go today , let's go come on 
funny reading reaction in aftermath of arsenal game vs . today . get used to it people , gonna be bumpy for the rest of the season 
diappointed @ the draw 
poor performance all round should be balanced against numerous injuries , but these are games that must be won to win the league 
manchester united are back !!!!
david moyes needs to fix up his bloody tactics sharpish . mind-numbingly poor in the majority of games this season . 
we played so badly today . fellaini and cleverley were very poor in midfield . and no kagawa in the squad again 
januzaj and hernandez shouldn't have been took off and cleverley should have been taken off for anderson/giggs 
why were our two tallest players fellaini and smalling marking a dwarf from that final free kick ? thick idiotic nutjobs 
minor setback 
what's our next 5 fixtures in the league ? 
how do i not know my way around birmingham when i lived here for 7 years , but i know my way round manchester & i've lived about 2 months 🙈
so many points dropped needlessly from winning positions . makes me so mad ! 
the game was never safe at 2-1 would of liked 3pts but one will have to 
please moyes , sell fellini , young and cleverly in january and buy some players that will help us compete at the top of the table !! 
that's what you get for substituting off quality like januzaj and chicharito and leaving a completely useless player like cleverley on 
too many key players missing , happy with 1 point ... 
i remember when we used to score them late goals ! 
we gonna win at bayarena against leverkusen on wednesday and at week-end man utd will beat tottenham ! 
i don't understand why fellaini plays for . nkt
wazza why dint you shoot 
next match need to improve ... especially defence 
 
very poor from . evans looked good . but if we're going to play adnan , why don't we give him more of the ball ?
that's it , another draw another drop points due to last minute goal by the opponent we gonna bounce back stronger !
so fans were trolling tottenham fans on their 100m plus useless team , well manchester united spent 27m on the shebesh wig on felaini
if we don't beat manchester united next week , i'll be very disappointed .
if moyes is the answer then we are fooked 
mufc forever .
credit to cardiff ! 👍 
in the blue side of manchester , they are laughing like they've won the title .
cleverly , fellaini absolute shockers . 
one of da worst performances ever from gear up lads or else dis season is gone
manchester united remain in sixth , one point behind southampton and rivals city , and seven points off leaders arsenal .
normal day at manchester united football club 😕😴
some fans still believed moyes isn't their problem
that performance screams out why we need to invest in midfield asap , no carrick no party it seems for our midfield play 
fuck sake laughing stock !!!! anyone give me 1 positive about fellaini ?? worse than djemba djemba peterboro yesterday manutd today 
could have been one point off of second smfh 
how the fuck do you beat arsenal and then lose to cardiff ... utterly disappointing 
glad manc's only got a draw ! fucking wankers moaning all time now . utd days are over , step a side hahaha 
our midfield today was shit ! no pressure or urgency from us ! too many performances like this under moyes ! and 4-4-2 is dead !! 
happy with a point in the end when it looked like we were going to get none ... cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
bebe was a better investment that fellatio 
every single fan who made the long trip up to manchester should get a full refund because today's performance was a disgrace . 
gotta congratulate . never gave up and never looked beaten . made a good game of it ! 
worst performance so far this season . 
united need to sell young , welbeck , valencia , anderson in january and buy some fucking class , reus and iniesta please . 
after all the hard work we do 2 get our season back on track . we go n throw it away misses 2 many chances .
full-time : cardiff 2 - 2 # mufc . despite goals from rooney and evra , the reds are denied by kim’s last-gasp leveller .
like fergie never managed them to woeful performances , there was plenty of them ! squad just not good enough .. faltered at board level 
absolute dogshit just brilliant man utd out of the title race average once again 
convert your chances ..! manutd didnt .! paid for it .. anyway .! onto my birthday ' day game ! mufc will win that i am sure .! :)
fergie time is against us this season . 
full time . manutd 2 - 2 cardiff city gila min akhir boleh lak cardiff gol haha . btw , hahahahaha
3 points >>>>>>>>>> 1 point 
english premier league : cardiff ( 2:2 ) manchester united
fellaini is not man united standard . its no point trying to stick a cube in a circle . it's clear to see he is well out of his depth . 
i think should give moyes a 10yr contract 
86 ' cardiff city 1 - 2 manchester united
brilliant weekend in manchester with the lovely ladies . so much fun . now back to reality . washing on
message to dog owners . never let a manchester united player walk your dog as they can't hold on to the lead .
had my patience with but now it's starting to run out ! enough said ! 
manchester united i hope your club burns to the ground and every1 in it get killed ! you let my bet down every fucking time £1000 !! argghgggg
it's still only a draw it's not 6 ( see what i did there ) 
manchester city did a good job with navas 👍
this needs sorting asap ! need to do business in january if possible ! 
i love manchester city
 #2pl
on to the next game , have to get the three points against spurs ! 
calm down you fucking plastics . at least we got points man shitty lost there . we'll move on and collect our trophy come may 
calm down you fucking plastics . at least we got points man shitty lost there . we'll move on and collect our trophy come may 
that was a dreadful end to the game ! :-/ 
omg ! manchester united sucks ! learn to play football !!!

4th place for manchester united ? oh no ! come back another day !
i remember once evra said are bunch of kids who are useless .. well , fuck you and 
ft : cardiff city 2 vs 2 manchester united 
yes it was a disappointing result but we need to move on to our next game ... negativity is not the way of a true united fan !!! 
it seems the mufc fans on here are blaming all . the players oo from gea to rooney
 hehe , dont worry guys . wait till next year you beat arsenal , it seems thats the only team you prepare for ,...
 are a headache . i swear !
ft : united 2 - 2 cardiff | goodjob red devils | win lose or draw , united till i die 
midfield needs to be addressed come jan ; need at least two cm ; 
get in cardiff city !! 90th minute equaliser ! love it !! 
for some reason i'm happy i never saw the game . wow , hard to swallow 
yes cardiff !! 
red cafe goes into meltdown 
peace and quiet on my tl this evening . why ??? ok , dropped points . uhmmm , guess no cursing or swearing tonight !
i want to see hernandez , welback , cleverly , young , anderson , fabio , and nani out . not worthy of this club . buy 2 proper mids . 
methinks means " lose more-yes ..", where in the name of heaven did this taciturn and unlikeable guy crawl from ? ..
all you can do is pick up the pieces and start all over again . 
worrying times for , as we fail to win yet another game .
so we get a single point .. still not giving up ! 
fulltime : cardiff 2-2 manchester united 
manchester phoenix 2-0 basingstoke bison . bakrlik from graham . timed 17:43 
sorry not so sorry but manchester united could have a victory over cardiff city .
funny everton now want to win games and utd want to settle for a one goal win and screw it up at the end 
manchester is red . cardiff red .
moyes u r taking back or forward 
 need more quality technical players . cleverley and fellaini are fucking shit and smalling is a dopey liability . 2 points dropped !!!!!!
shopping in was hard work , glad to be home now .
could of been a lot worse but so disappointing 
im pretty sure when fergie was manager of he stole bernards watch , thats how they won 20 titles .
what a way to start my week ! ☺
cleverley , fellaini , valencia , januzai , hernandez all had terrible games today . don't seem to have any self belief . need to work hard 
 and .. what a wasted for ... very disappointed .
i'm united with manchester
lost for words . 
getting tired of johnny evans 
rotten last few days for me , pathetic manchester united result just rubbed it in just for good measure ..
i keep saying this fellaini is not material !! wasted millions ! 
where are all those manutd fans who were gloating after the arsenal match ? one game doesnt define a season . i hope you've learnt from this .
manchester united midfield missing last seen : long long ago characteristics : passer , tackler and occasional scorer . reward : contact glazers
thank you kim of for keeping from climbing to 4th !
mufc fans very quiet this season 
always nice throwing 2 points away in injury time . we need a hell of a lot of investment in january ! 
we should've held on to that lead and taken a scrappy 3 points . important points for title winning sides . 
unfortunate we couldn't see the game out but another important point away from home . 
unbeaten 10 match ! 😈
 would be lucky to finish 4th . we suck
full time cardif 2-2 
next three league games is going to be huge ! we got spurs , everton and newcastle . 
everytimes faellani play united just get draw or lose . no contribution very easy to lostball , wrong pass . very2 poor player 
not seen one thing said about medel by the ex pros/pundits on here but they ain't stopped going on about rooney ! 
what a pile of shit . bastards . could've gone top 4 with a win . cannot play like that vs leverkusen 
payah rooney :] x , manchester united 2-2 cardif city
why did manutd beat arsenal ,, hahah waste of time
arsenal & liverpool to face chelsea and man city in december . that should help united . i hope at least . don't shit on it guys ! 
dan united gagal merangsek ke 4 besar . come on , lads . don't waste the important point anymore . we should be focus , focus & focus ! 
glory glory manchester united !!!
r . i . p manchester united
just heard a manchester united fan say he might start supporting city 
expected : mancity draw manutd big wins reality ??

a team to die for 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 man utd goal : rooney " 15 " , cambell " 32 " , evra " 45 ", kim " 90 " 
calm your tits people , long way to go . so called fans , relax .
 piss poor
well that was disappointing 
manchester didn't deserve to win this though , rooney could have been red carded on the third minute !
cleverley poor , fellaini has now shown over and over why we should have left him where he was . give me the money to waste instead 
am so gutted about the result !! 
everton have offloaded fellaini look at them now ... 
dropping points feels like losing cup finals these days 
we tied ... are you kidding me ? 
how many times do we have to watch tinker , tailor , solider , incompetent ! we need a manager ! 
fuck up of the day . i mean dat midfield is awful
cuda been worst ... nex weekn gon b evn tuffer .... nex 4 games overall gon b tuff 
christmas break is being dedicated to figuring out everything i need to go to manchester for a year and getting as far away as possible 👌
serves moyes right for leaving my nigga rvp back in manchester . i'm so fucking pissed , holy fuck ! fuck you moyes .
anyone think we don't need central midfielders ? didn't think so . 
where's that mrs mufc bitch ?
no jones , no carrick , no rvp .... is nothing ....!!! ??
rooney ffs 
if manutd win jn , fourth place sia . 😭😭
were not ' manchesterunited♡ ' anymore . just manchester ..
gutted could see that equaliser coming , just missed some good chances today , chin up boys 
* toss * :d : ft ~ cardiff city 2 - 2 manutd .. always support and love you united ! 
kill your self , fellani is ducking shit 
ft : cardiff 2 vs 2 
 if no top 4 this season 
next week we play spurs , yes they got hammered 6 today but they will still be a threat against us . hope it goes well 
kpop made manutd draw with cardiff .
manchester united hhahah that's how cheats are rewarded
7 points behind the leaders with 26 games to play , can be made up in three matches 
cleverley , fellaini and cdfs .... awful game today . rooney ( even with that last miss goal) , valencia and evra remarcable . 
about two weeks ago mufc fans were saying they were back , so what happened today ? 🙈 .
manutd drew .. wow thats a good news :d
i shall continue standing by manchester united , win , lose or draw . we will always be red devils 
well fact is , both manchester teams weren't capable of defeating cardiff this year .
draw . keep calm and always support manchester united 
minor lil setback 
still head up lads ! 
fulltime : manchester city 6-0 tottenham , manchester united 2-2 cardiff city
let's all laugh at manchester united ! ♥ ft : cardiff 2-2 manchester united ! 
keep calm and become champions 
used to be attack , attack , attack . now we're sit back , sit back , sit back . 
smalling fellaini welbeck and cleverly are not quality players . get rid
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
so this is how liverpool have felt the last 20 years ............... 
hahaha be like 
without carrick , our central midfield was shit . and there aren't many answers in the squad to call on . 
manchester city 6-0 tottenham⚽good game
woles aja :) keep support brooo =d
4 points out of 6 against the manchester clubs , happy with that !
may our collective rage induce you to play with a little more determination . 
under ferguson , this would be seen as typical form , not playing well but picking up results ahead of post christmas upturn in form .
kaizer chiefs and manchester united ruined my sporting weekend
well done cardiff , we should've done better 
very proud with asian player score again manutd .......
i'm still in shock what the fuck was rooney doing , it was easier to score , end of the day lucky to get a point 
united need a new cb cm lm rm & a new striker if rooney leaves . 
next match manchester united vs tottenham hotspur
take a point the way we played then .. just gutting to concede in the 90th min 
 good point for united at cardiff , u have 2 remember theyre not the force they were , they have moyes in charge now not fergie ...
our player didnt manage to play well . we are lacking in many field . even our defence wasnt much sensational as aspected !!! mufc
with this kinda of midfield i can't imagine how nov and dec will go for us 
we threw that one away . still unbeatin 👍😎 
still a point is better than nothing , best is yet to come 
just even more glaring evidence united need 2 cm's asap ! fellaini is not a cm and cleverley is average . 4-4-2 doesnt work vs a 4-5-1 !! 
fellaini and cleverley in midfield ..... you might as well have played rafael and park in there 
start to worry about cardiff . unbeaten against manchester teams so far .
united just can't afford to be dropping sloppy points . could have moved up to 4th , instead 6th in the table n 7 pts behind arsenal . 
i missed my dinner for that ? 
manchester united fans feeling the misery what fans from other clubs have felt over the course of years when fergie was around . brilliant .
here comes the spoilt twats whinging about anything and everything city lost to cardiff you fucking twats 
just hoping we do not get knocked out of ucl ! 
watching us without carrick is excruciating . 
rip manutd .. next bayer n spurs away ! fuck all performance . wtf is happening ?
we love united we do . no one bigger than manchester united .
still a manchester utd fan no matter what !!
late goals are usually the story of united's season , just not normally down the other end . chance missed . 
dear football , thank you for this weekend . love you long time . 
when some players do not deserve to play for .!!
well done , no problem . because king of bpl still manchester united thanks for tonight david moyes .
never known a more gutting sporting weekend and all done in the last minute .
this match result is making me miss sir . alex ferguson a lot ! shit ! 
the unbeaten run continues . 
manchester at night is mintttttt
some players are ruining rooney efforts 
cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united . 90 ' bo-kyung kim 
thankyou for such performances !
leverkusen spurs newcastle and everton next for manchester united . only gets tougher from here on in for them 
cardiff deserved that , our performance wasn't good enough . we've dropped too many points in the closing stages of games this season . 
manchester united . are actually not that good this year . 
tot and everton next mehn ko ni easy 
win , draw or lose . now , tomorrow and forever i will always love manchester united
united minus carrick and rvp are extremely average 
six and the city ( of manchester ); one team scored 6 the other is 6th on the table
come back wen it is may : if arsenal finishes on 19th then manchester united will be just behind in 20th .... no way moyes will
typical . chica gets no chances , then welbeck and rooney screw up 3 easy ones . 
last minute goals are always the worst , 10 games unbeaten though ! 
sucks to be manchester united fans right now
not even sure we are gonna qualify from champs league group stage . sigh . 
and to all my followers , i say " take heart ," it's still a long way off . it's a league . lol !
those fickle united fans who also tweet can jog on . don't have a clue about football , muppets . 
c'mon whether lose or draw ..... we are manchester united 
he / they need to improve , can do better !!! 
it's not the fact that we've drawn . it's the manner in which we've . 2 certain points dropped . 
rooney again giving 💯% in the game great goal , perfect with corners , and some great chances shame not a win 
even when the ref helps them they still loose lol awe its now safe to say retired with wih the old man
anyone else think fergie left a sinking ship ? 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united . 
every club has their down season , this is just our first one in the last 10 years 
i can't believe yakh - . - ' rooney missed a golden chance .. welbeck missed a chance too . we needed that 3 points but hard luck .
grrrrrr so close to 3 points . head up and on to the next one !!!! 
good result for manchester united away from home , only a point off a europa league place now 
 huge respect .... the way they ve performed against the manchester clubs ... gonna be a very very toughmatch there next week 
ft 2-2 really good game . kept going and got deserved point . could've won it even after equaliser . 
that feeling when don't win #
manchester united are true battlers ! relegation battlers ! :p :p
tetep glory glory manchester united !
no need to panic . 7 points off the top . by jan if we're within 5 off , then we can start talking about a title challenge 
its not a bad point considering rooney should of been off and cardiff had some good chances 
manutd is just a shit messed up and fucked up team
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 . 
not just happy with manchester united .. why will dey go and draw that free game ..
wei ... manchester united ada game sekarang !! okey , haza say " i'm not going to watch it ..!"
manchester city = 33 goals 11 match
fuck manchester united !
welbeck should work on his ability to make top notch controls and touches in front of goal otherwise , he'll never make it in football . 
when you have all stopped moaning about our team ... kindly f**koff and support someone else . 
united is currently sixth on the table . pretty sure we can climb back to top of the table . 
today didn't go so well cos a could ve made 4th place on the 
spurs away and everton at home our next two premier league fixtures . can’t afford to drop any more points . both games are must win . 
after seeing the flowing magic that was city , what i just watched was dreary . just dreary . 
 sure know how to ruin a good weekend . haven't seen a united team so poor with the ball in my life . horrible to watch sometimes ! 😡
if we lose this game to cardiff i will be pissed 
can't wait for the january transfer window , hopefully we will buy the right players if we buy anyone . 
nothing better than manchester united fc loosing the points !!! :d
come on united !!!! !!!!
manchester united 2-2 cardiff city 
every result is crucial . we shouldn't be losing almost guaranteed points . 
what on earth was rooney thinking not striking that himself 
 cardiffian !! 
if moyes no kill me with hbp , he no go leave united .... 
david moyes is so inept in managing manutd who bought in clumsy falaini for waste
get powell back 
at least i got pork belly for dinner to look forward to . food for the pain . 
one body , one family , we are manchester united
took 4 points off the manchester teams 
the only competition is manchester city ! i said this from the onset
fuckin giveaway that game . 😠
manchester though . y u no give me peace this season ?
dull and boring , we are manchester united and we're sixth on the table ! 
obviously van persie a massive loss up front too . 
that's not what i meant when i was thinking that we need more goals !! 
keep calm n ' always support 
then somebody will still come and be telling manutd will still carry epl this season mntcheww awon oloshi
heading cause the point deducted by 2 . 1pts for manchester united tonight . it's a nice game guys . keep it up .
car 2-2 mufc up 
cant see top four in the prem changing tbh .... i cant see a manchester team winning this year
tottenham boss andre villas-boas admitted his side had paid a ' heavy price ' for a woeful performance as they lost 6-0 to manchester city .
what a shit team we had on .. wtf is wrong with moyes ?? cleverly , valencia , welbeck , evans are all shit 
feeling over confident in plays when he's some shit 
difficult game , noble draw . rooney should have won it . cleverley : good player but i don't think he's united material . 
liverpool fc 3-3 everton fc manchester united 2-2 cardiff city arsenal 2-0 southampton manchester city 6-0 tottenham ( lmao) .
we will still win the league though 
moyes and his senseless subs ... really needs to work on that 
now to begin my 5hr journey back to manchester ...
fellaini is just lost in 
 out of the title race hehehe
evra will pull through 
forever 
2-2 not bad united !!! morning rooney ;;) * yawn
we will always support man utd . dont worrehhh ! good job guys . frust a little bit . lol
believe 
rooney again giving 󾭻% in the game great goal , perfect with corners , and some great chances shame not a win 
i don't like it when we don't win , that doesn't mean i will not support my team every single day !!! 
27m for the shebesh wig . quit pricey 
oh well ! it is what it is still support 
na wa fr manchester united o
bit more karma for the united fans there 
crappy defence , clueless midfield , toothless attack .. atrocious ! of 
 if there is no rooney , united will be religated . too much depending on him . other players should wake up now .
utterly disappointing 
glory glory manchester united 
i was alive when manutd had shit english trio of young welbeck cleverly
i don dey vex ! fuck moyes ! fuck some players like cleverley , welbeck and evans too ! 
fergie time has been against us this season . 
rooneys been first class this season why did he not put that late chance away . the teams full off average players 
i miss , i miss , i miss . could be worse could be . players threw that away not the manager 
pretty furious 😡😡😡 what is the meaning of winning arsenal . we lose points recklessly 
yekun hesab ; cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 15 ' wayne rooney 33 ' fraizer campbell 45 ' patrice evra 90+1 ' bo-kyung kim
there is a club called cardiff city and there is manchester united 
cardiff city fc 2-2 manchester united | final | barclays premier league de inglaterra
well at least we didn't lose to cardiff 
both manchester teams couldn't beat us👌👌
cardiff has owned manchester without even visiting the city yet ! two gaints down
players like medel & mutch needed for manchester united instead of cleverly fellaini !
so nice to see that happen to united at 90mins 
all weekend we were talking about other teams to loose and draw ... and finally we are the one who end up in draw 
if we had won we'd be 4 right now 
still behind southampton :) 
moyes wake the fuck u and realise who you're managing . this isn't fucking good enough . 
it was an entertaining game but we should have won it . not that cardiff deserved to lose . 
seriously !!! mufc mid is really suck , we need world class or talented mid in jan
next bpl lawan tottenham 
 like fucking hell we gonna win the league . with saf this would have been an easy win . moyes is not good enough .
mufc in moyed we trust ha ha
we fucking missed carrick today ! 
today just proves how important carrick is to this united team , nothing in midfield without him ! less said about fellaini the better .. 
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united 
difference of a goal ... prove manutd wrong
serves rooney right for trying to jew it . desperate need of a good midfielder . missed micky c , fellani , clev don't cut the mustard 
two points dropped in the first of three tough games this week ! 
think today is another example of why man city are now the better team in manchester !!! and utd fans know it
when the afro man start we dont win . 
cardiff frustrate another manchester club at home , great resilience to earn a 2-2 draw , not a great performance by united 
manchester united ! lol if only u dint hate on juve 
making defensive substitutions and sitting back trying to protect a 1-0 lead yet again . that's not how united play 
7 points ahead of these cunts from manchester
not good enough from united ....!!! 
still 
such a shame though , if cardiff hadn't equalised , we'd be looking back on this as a traditional united ' seeing it out ' performance . 
so gutted i didn't put a bet on i said it was going to be 2-2 😩 
cardiff fc , manchester's most feared enemy
it's not good result ! but , keep calm and suport , 24/7 ! this season is too long david's boys !!
manutd needs to be consistent .. we cant play like shit just because carrick's injured ...
too bad for manchester united . they have a chance to back in top 4 but pass it away :(
evans is complete shit ! shouting at januzaj when he's not even half as talented as the youngster . evans is a useless scumbag . 
another 2 points dropped united ffs what's happening , can't blame the manager for that ! 
nice game 
manchester united : 3
lol at manchester united . 😂😂😂😂
rooney fucked up big time ..... geez ... another annoying draw 
manchester united can play like nonsense sometimes hey mxm
10 match unbeaten all competition , 6 win & 4 draw . not bad , next leverkusen !!! 
nothing pisses me off more , when everyone becomes manchester united's oppositions fan ! !
that's just an embarrassing tie ... get rid of moyes 
 
it is what it is ! we'll bounce back always do ! 
so we've ended up with 4 points from wales , i just hope we can get 3 in germany on wednesday . 
fellaini was a joke today . no wonder why everton fans didn't give a fuck when he was sold . 
ft : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
win against arsenal draw cardiff 
cardiff have taken 4 points out of 6 from the both manchester clubs , fair play cardiff ! 
didn't play well today but we had the chances to win the game 
someone will bring a stat and say that is the first goal have conceded in injury time for twenty sumfn years smh
could hear a collective sigh of relief from soccer traders when cardiff equalised . the manchester double was loaded up on at 7/4 today !
late equaliser by cardiff city saw them gain 1 point . 
momentum killed ! /: 
still can't believe we conceded in the 90th min ... 
last season it was " late goals " which helped through out the season and this season it's the same " late goals " which is hurting . 
 has got to be the worst player in history and i saw , , , etc ... total waste of money !! 
city mo menang 6-0 lah . city ngalahin mu 6-1 lah . manchester is always red . not blue . blue just for film .
man city , everton , swansea and manchester united have all failed to beat cardiff at home , yet we beat them 1-0 . long way to go this season .
lmao ... manchester united 😂😂
well done holding the scum to a draw ... 
that was fucking painful , united absolutely muck , got what they deserved 
7 points gap . manchester fans da fuck you saying ? still top of the league 
way too many plastic fans on twitter . back your team or fuck off . 
moyes ' reaction said it all . anyone with a screen cap of the aftermath of rooney's cockup ? 
our midfield is shit . what the fuck does fellaini bring to the team ? cleverley is a headless fucking chicken and isn't good enough . 
bastard team ever . useless manager ever . much hate mufc
tetep keren manchester united 
why do we sit on a one goal lead - moyes is so defensive it's killing me 
excited for manchester christmas markets next weekend⛄️🎄🎁🍷
ft : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united
without scholes n carrick in the middle of the park .. u guys cant even beat cardiff .... 
looool manchester united made my day :d
felliani a waste of money cleverley a waste of space but moyes starts and finishes with both thats why we didnt win poor again 
retweet if you're laughing at manchester united .
not a bad games , just doesn't luck at this time 
what a great time worshipping and hanging out with grace church manchester people .
remind me why we sent lingard & powell on loan when they could easily do a better job than cleverley & fellaini ? 
ft : 2 - 2 cardiff
28 million for fellaini . that's about 27.8 million to much . fuckin pathetic performance by him . carrick get fit quick my good man 
manchester united 2 and cardiff city 2
cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
seriously manchester united ? ==
i swear moyes has so many different starting lineups it's crazy .. the man literally ruined manchester and it's not even half way .
 why does cleverly stay in the game can't control the mid can't defend can't what r u thinking ???? y does he start ???
missed vidic carrick rvp today :( 
next game we have to do better 
ah sit happens . needed 3 got 1 is still better than 0 . we'll bounce back 
if you lay a single match without vidic , jones , rafael and carrick ... this is how bad defensively is .. may be worse ..
i'm back to being a fickle fan 
moyes wake the fuck up and realise who you're managing . this isn't fucking good enough . 
full time : cardiff city 2-2 manchester united | rooney 15 ' campbell 33 ' evra 45 ' kim 90 '
 we are now 7 points off the top and in 6th position where we could hav been 4th ... this is a bad result in my book !!!
aaanyways , manchester united >
five cantona's four cantona's three cantona's two cantona's and an eric cantona !!!!!!!! 
on the bright side we're still unbeaten in 10 games now under the new manager . 
hahaha stupid moyes 
a team with a + 5 goal diff after 12 games tells its own story 
try know that manchester united are finished
wow ! relinquishes 2 points in extra time . the strange season continues .
missed chances for 3-1 , feels like a defeat ! 3 points off 2nd though and 2 massive away games to come this week ! onwards and upwards 
ft cardiff 2-2 manchester united | 
tottenham boss andre villas-boas admitted his side had paid a ' heavy price ' for a woeful performance as they lost 6-0 to manchester city ."
cardiff city 2-2 manchester united , a draw as both teams share the same point
manchester united are too confident just now- . -
welbeck chance , rooney's last chance that he choose to fucking pass it than shoot .. stupid - .. bet we will not win the league ..
only two games on today , but both surprising results . which one was better , draw or a hammering ?
ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
full time . manchester united 2-2 cardiff city . manchester united !! <3
rip manchester united .
thiago ? fabregas ? gündogan ? draxler ? all attacking creative midfielders what we need !! and we end up with fucking fellaini 
kim my boy , god bless u son 
u can't swap an iphone for a nokia & expect it to do the same job 
fdp a manchester united
cardiff a fait une manchester ...
i repeat ... chica not good to start 
come guys let's focus on the club that played worse than manutd tonight tottenham hotspur hahaha .
frustrating draw . down a spot in the table to sixth . 
it was not the players ... it was the crowd that deserved the draw ... what an atmosphere ...
disapppointtteddd ! 
stopped playing when we got in front . sort it out moyes 
ft| cardiff 2-2 united : we weren't good enough ... though many have come here and lost , can't say i'm happy with the point . 
don't know if this window will be different to any other in the past 6 years , but i can't wait for january . would love another cm 
what an end . two very different , but very entertaining matches today . manchester city 6-0 tottenham & cardiff city 2-2 manchester united .
we love 
a united team with ronaldo in it used to put these mickey mouse teams to the sword . without rvp we look poor , midfield is useless . 
 . crap . probably a decent point but shocking performance
cardiff has taken 4 points from manchester teams now
what a brilliant weekend of football ! 
terrific stuff from the biggest team in manchester earlier today against tottenham
manchester just depress me suh today sigh still me side fi life tho
sorry mufc fans ... come back next week
manchester united should have don beta
we don't play just for scoring , we play for honor for respect , for glory , for the passion for what we believe in . 
we are piss poor . i don't enjoy watching us 
it's official . god hates manchester united . yep
ft : cardiff city 2 2 [ rooney 15 ' evra 45'] . 
glory glory manchester united . for in the face adversity we hold our heads high & persevere to the end .
on a more optimistic note , we didn't lose . 
plastic fans everywhere on this ! 
let's be honest mufc played like shit n didn't deserve to win
win , draw , or lose we will always love manchester united !
seriousely what happened to the last minute holding n scoring power
bad game ! bad result ...! 
cardiff city vs manchester united 2-2 
no matter how bad anderson might play he's by far better than that tortoise like fuckin shite called 
still poor in defending ... weak in middlefield ... and lack of finishing ... hopefully it'll get better on the next match 
ryan giggs shld not play 4 manu again 
moyes you better bring in midfielders this january otherwise it's over . 
enough , enough of this crappy manager and his tactics ! moyes out ! 
cleverley : shocking . absolutely shocking . fellaini : crap . totally crap . 
kim headed home on 90mins as cardiff drew 2-2 with man utd , rooney scoring & assisting , but lucky to have been on pitch to do so 
ffs man how did we give a goal like that away in the last mins -_- 
its so funny reading the fans tweets 😂😂😂😂
ft :: cardiff 2-2 united . not a good result man ! 
out of my mentions u haters !
consistency will win you the league and is . goodbye to 
im actually so disappointed with manchester united😔😢💔
ion even knw wat we re playin dis season 
cardiff city deserve the draw , i meant they deserve to win . come on 
that's a performance and result truly befitting the " wonderful owners " of mufc .
when manchester united don't win , i'm happy .
omg united like what are you playing at ???? 
final score is cardiff city : 2 manchester united : 2
gutted .... 2 points lost ... we should be 4th on the table ... 
no matter what , will be with manutd :') sadness , happiness , greget , emosi . that is the beauty of football ..
dizzy welbz should have scored his first chance and killed the game 
dropped points , disappointing . knew we would struggle in the middle without carras . mediocre midfield ! horrible feeling 
cardiffcity 2- 2 mufc
full-time : cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united ( fraizer campbell 22 ', kim bo-kyung 90 ' - wayne rooney 15 ', patrice evra 45 ' ) 
the only manchester club to take a point away at cardiff this season .
fucking chink 
valencia , nani , young , anderson , cleverley and fellaini are all fucking shite and nowhere near the standard we need . 
why did he bring on welbeck dat dude is bad luck d last time he played was against southampton and we conceded a last min goal 
david moyes is a coward and he's too small-time for manchester united . whenever he gets a lead he has the team sit on it . ridiculous .
somebody promise me villa won't let united walk away from villa park with three points next month . 
today didn't go so well cos a win could ve made it 4th place 
what a terrible end to the weekend ! ugh hope we are more clinical for the midweek game . 
just to clarify ... i've fucking hates evra and his terrible defending for 3 years or so ... check my tweets and my facebook ... dogshit 
why you ruin my mood everytime , remember when it was you getting late goals now you lot leaking goals like you need a fukn plumber
wank performance from us there 
not nice when it happens to you is it ? gwarrn cardiff
there was no way manchester was going to beat cadif city . it would have been soo unfair
ft cardiff city 2 - 2 manchester united
when does the transfer window open ? 
manchester united made me cry today
half of that utd squad need clearing out , welbeck and cleverley especially , never going to be good enough . 
bayer leverkusen on wednesday ! 
ill take a top 3 finish cl quarter finals and the f.a. cup . real talk . 
no robin no party 
win , lose or draw . united till i die . 
moyes is a negative , dreary , safe only , defending , hoofing type of manager ; hence are rubbish so 
mufc would have lost 3-2 with carrick in the side .
good game united . excellent result . 2 points lost . 
not as if we lost is it , should of done better but if we get a little run going we're right back in it ! 
bet why ???
cardiff 2 - 2 embarrassing . how many more points are we gonna loose this season 
we never had the mf ... got gifted the 1st goal ... we didn't deserve more than 1pt today 
bad market for manchester united fans .
didn't deserve the 3 points . terrible defending by pat . fellaini needs to sort himself out . may put it right wed 
‘ manchester city humiliate spurs - in pictures ’ …nah , you’re alright
 could hav been better result gave the victory away . last team both teams met was 1975 and utd won 4-0
cardiff sneaked a fergie time goal on us , the fury the fury 
well what do you expect with & in midfield ! don't get me started on ... wasted two dead cert chances ! 
 
lose win draw , keep support 
i don't like good matches . i like annihilation . cleverley and welbeck gotta go . fellaini skating on the thinnest of ice . 
2 precious points dropped . cardiff is tough game but losing assured points on sloppy defence in the 90th min is unacceptable 
fuck u lah fellaini .. 
manchester squads can't hang at cardiff
average teams lyk manutd always play best wen dey play top teams , d lads frm cardiff must b gutted for dropping 2 points
i love you so manchester united ♥
manchester united are pure shit
we r not gona win anything we will be lucky if we qualify for champions league we have a very poor bench all we have sponsorship 
enough of the fucking sponsor deals . we need a quality mid fielder who can walk straight into the team . giggs provided more 1/2
well that was frustrating 
 you thick twat , we can't defend for shit yet you've tried to defend a one goal lead again ! 
manchester utd loses 2 points and ever body lose their minds . get a life haters . -az .
stupid poxy vincent tan with his cheap crappy red cardiff shirt . hope his belt chokes his neck . 
why manutd ? it's just too emotional watching , we could've gone 4th
mufc just killed my vibe : |
