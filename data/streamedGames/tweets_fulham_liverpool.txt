real madrid and liverpool games happening at the same time ! 😱⚽️
is he wearing them because that's when he played for ajax ? ( fulham's manager right now is martin jol , who managed ajax then )
fulham counter and johnson deflects the shot after his short pass lead to the counter .
mosses should play cause he is from chelsea then he liverpool will win
if liverpool could get they're act together right now they'd be winning ... but nooo
don’t forget that liverpool had kasami on their books .
 liverpool -fulham

15 minutes chelsea 15 minutes liverpool . that's love .
liverpool vs fullham
liverpool playing well
dejagah and kasami is better than the whole liverpool
counter-attacks will end up giving fulham the advantage .
i am the struggle to watch both the games woah 
bleak day , but lovely to tune into liverpool
" and fulham can launch a counterattack of their own " - berbatov gets the ball and pretty much stands still on the halfway line .
liverpool coach is a little bit dumb , benching victor moses that is 1000 times better than henderson .
senderos vs liverpool makes me remember that champions league game at anfield ...
liverpool playing amazing !
im sure they will kick fulham in the ass
you know liverpool is actually playing pretty well
liverpool vs fullham
fulham brought about 100 fans absolute disgrace

liverpool could win this 42-0 . fulham eager to get their manager fired with their white flag job right now
come on liverpool !
got liverpool on on the computer . they're facing fulham . battle of the small clubs at anfield .
it sucks how nbc isn't showing the liverpool game .
kasami is a good little player . fulham need more players under the age of 83 , though .
come on liverpool 
the people of liverpool enjoy fireworks that much they set them off during the day .... and after bonfire night
got a stream of the liverpool game quality isn't the best but i'm used to 360p seen as i'm on toaster internet anyway
listening to liverpool game on the radio and watching the darts 
please lose liverpool . please
berbatov is so good on the ball cannot deny that ! but liverpool have had the better chances so far and are looking lively 
 is fucking dominating 
let's go liverpool !
liverpool will win today 4-0 ... be top of the league :)
fulham r poor on these setpieces . bt the stats say otherwise
hope liverpool and chelsea draw !!
watch chelsea or liverpool ? the sas seems interesting ...
once del liverpool en anfield : mignolet ; jonhson , skrtel , agger , cishoko ; gerrard , l . leiva , henderson , coutinho ; sturridge , luis suárez .
liverpool's work rate in defence is awesome . not title winners by any stretch , but a happy fan thus far 
kasami is going to make fulham a lot of money when they sell him . when not if . 
want fulham to do a madness against liverpool .
sume keda buke liverpool , shit

yes liverpool ! this is what i like to hear ! 
fulham opening floodgates after dream start at anfield
fulham are playing like they're down a man . just sitting back and absorbing pressure .
after a two-nil defeat to arsenal you couldn't do better than have fulham at home . 
liverpool tho
if buy a dm and get better lb play coming up in january they will be top 4 . no doubt in my mind
liverpool have had 11 shots against fulham in half an hour . will this be martin jol's last afternoon in charge of fulham ?
same old same old . this is fulham . what a load of shit . will kahn ever sack this pile of crap .
come on liverpool

as a fulham fan i hold my hands up and say this year is a very very awful time for the club , ageing squad , dysfunctional manger . 
liverpool
liverpool is doin work
another header . skrtel puts one in from a corner to make it 2-0 to liverpool
if fulham loose by 4 goals i think jol could be on his way

assists it's two assists inside five minutes for liverpool's steven gerrard . both of the reds ' goals came from the midfielder's set pieces "

i'd be very surprised if jol is still at fulham after the international break . they are in total disarray .

fulham is totally being dommed by right now .
why do any studying when you can watch liverpool crush mid-table teams instead ? 
on one hand you could say liverpool and southampton are only beating bucket teams .. it's true , but hull gave us loads ... 
hopeless fulham . manure won effortlessly , pool gonna win big

i've watched all liverpool's a games this season ... and fulham are by far the worst team we've played .. and we've played palace !! 
fulham are this years wigan . 
liverpool vs fulham xx
liverpool playing some good football . but it is fulham they are against . 
loving this attacking brand of football liverpool is playing . this formation & the return of key players provide more stability
liverpool score one more and then park the bus k ?
i meant a bigger lead to liverpool . fulham are just awful at defending set pieces right now .
fulham , if liverpool's setpieces actually work against you , you need to rethink your strategy
2-0 pour liverpool
fulham are awful
great save stekelenburg ! the dutchman denies coutinho with a brilliant stop but liverpool are all over fulham . 2-0 .
like i said liverpool going to win .
15 out of liverpool's 19 goals ( 79%) in the premier league this season have come in the first half . quick out of the blocks . 
liverpool done see children wey dem go flog ...
when will this liverpool bubble burst !!! when suarez leaves for madrid in january ?
liverpool <3 !!!
buzzing that it's 2-0 liverpool 😆😆
liverpool leading .. yeesss !
ynwa ... forever ..... go reds goo ....
fulham should be banned from the epl ..... common one two passes you cant play
hahaha ! jeff stelling " liverpool have had 11 attempts in the first 30 mins " extremely optomistic about this season .
liverpool
i woke up late , and so only had gentlemen jim on for about three minutes before i turned him off . even his dulcet tones can't save 
what ? liverpool 2 goals up already ? bt hey , what do u expect when they are playing against fulham .
why is jol still our manager ? 
go out the room miss two goal ! anyways c'mon liverpool brilliant
if only liverpool play like this every week we would be like arsenal lol
come on liverpool get the 3 points :)
the whole fulham team is defending lul
think i'm actually quicker than every single fulham footballer 
fulham are dog shit and lambert never misses penaltys ! 
just a £10 liverpool and southampton double each week would make you £543 up this season 
easy come on liverpool
liverpool is winning !!!
bang bang and within a few minutes liverpool are 2-0 up against fulham , and it looks to be 3-0 soon ☺ 
me and dad sat in the front room with rugby on the t.v. and liverpool on the ipad
32min gone liverpool winning 2.0
3 points for liverpool
life is hard being a fulham fan .
 are rampant as they lead 2-0 v fulham at 
while chelsea plays liverpool have become mercenaries !!
this is poetry in motion today . what a great start for liverpool .
need a link for liverpool fulham 
i'd love to see arsenal win the league and liverpool get top 3 just for a change ..
not bad ah liverpool😏
in a league with some pretty rotten teams , fulham are rotten like a pint of milk left beside a radiator for 5 days .
omg i have my 2nd offer from liverpool john moores !!!!! 😃 #2offersinaweek
on paper fulham should be a good side but are beyond poor the slick passing and move from is destroying the lads in white
liverpool dey form incredible hulk for fulham ,
liverpool are playing much better today than they did last week against arsenal !
for me palace are certain to go down , fulham look that way as well
i've always said fulham are terrible , but you've got to be a special kind of terrible to let us score from a corner against you .
someone just ate your girl and she cooked for her too and liverpool are scoring
jol surly now will be sacked , problem is who will even consider the fulham job now ? all season
if liverpool were playing like this last week we would actually have a good game .
is the liverpool vs fulham game live on tv ?
 are really improving since they started playing the triangles 
liverpool look absolutely awesome , fulham are awful but it's 2-0 and it could be 5 already
i'm afraid liverpool will improve their goal difference drastically today . fulham looks like a pub team on the anfield turf .
yeah that's the way liverpool . 2-0 :)
anyway , it's already 3-0 lead in madrid and 2-0 in liverpool , so i can focus on the bundesliga . probably
its funny how people still call liverpool shit
can't believe i'm missing the real madrid game because some dude wants to watch liverpool !!!
liverpool with two goals and neither from sas
ohhh liverpool we love you 
liverpool looking like the old days ! magic ... ynwa !
talking about us do some firing , i think fulham might get hiding today ? martin jol might be getting his p45 first !!
i won't be surprised if martin jol is the first to be sacked ... this fulham is just so awful .
definitely someone somehow has to pay for last week's blunder ... fulham ... 2-0 .
feeling greedy , but liverpool's midfield really deserves to get a goal . don't care who amongst em .
i do like how fulham have taken the novel idea of letting our most creative player , coutinho , have acres of space and time on the ball
2/3 of fulham's team on defense . not even exaggerating here .
with coutinho , liverpool look tough . great creative player there
liverpool are running riot . absolute domination . we will concede in the second half though 
liverpool is in fire
love watching suarez tear up the pitch ! running circles around the fulham f.c. 
goal ! liverpool go further ahead as skrtel heads home a gerrard corner . too easy . | 26 ' liverpool 2-0 fulham | 
liverpool 2-0 up already , could be embarrassing for fulham at this rate ! 
ahh fuck it , just watch liverpool ba , since its on the tv .

if you put £2000 on liverpool to win now , you'll win £10 if they do 
liverpool are good for a 2 goal lead after 30 minutes played against a poor fulham team 
come on liverpool , lets really do a job on these today ! 
it's an absolute joy to watch my team playing like this , we have fulham on the ropes 
i'm enjoying this total control by lfc but lets not forget who we are playing . a top 4 side should do this to fulham . win the ones we should
southampton -1 and liverpool -1 is looking promising !
liverpool is playing very well today .
fulham don't run do they ?
bloody great my fulham defender scored an own goal

liverpool playing some really goods stuff . patient build-up as they move into fulham's half then they burst to life in and around the box
liverpool playing well and dominating first-half . 
thank god fulham aren't playing with rapid wingers bombing on , on the counter . our defence is so exposed . terrific from us so far though .
liverpool are playing unbelievably :d
if liverpool don't win i'm gonna cry ok
it has been all liverpool so far . gerrard already has produced two free-kicks which turned out to be assists for the 2-0 lead so far .

liverpool now leads 2-0 against fulham at anfield 
25 ' skrtel , what a good header !! liverpool 2 vs 0 fulham

johnson is the perfect right-back for liverpool . he needs a contract extension , now . 
32´ 0-0 34´ 0-0 19´ 0-0 34` 0-0 34 2-0 
and now we change to a different channel to watch a match between liverpool & fulham . a good news actually ☺

skrtel has made up for the og he scored last season for fulham at anfield . still leading 2-0 . nice shot sturridge .
fulham looking desperate again . i like jol & desperately want him to do well but fulham are piss poor
fulham got so many crap footballers on the field . sidwell , richardson , etc

southampton and liverpool both winning in today's tips !
fulham making it so easy for us and we're not even having to play well 
i can't tell if i'm watching zombies from the walking dead or martin jol's fulham team .
the moment konchesky and hangheland left fulham . and suck players like richardson and senderos lined up in their defence .
emphatic performance from liverpool so far .
seeing rihanna in liverpool has made my day !! so happy😄
liverpool raping fulham right now .. 
liverpool are absolutely raping fulham . it's actually embarrassing
this is the proper liverpool : suarez , sturridge , coutinho & gerrard all starting !

fulham are truly shit
felel bad for fulham fans cause they are shocking making glen johnson look like messi

liverpool are balling at the minute
if fulham are gonna keep performing like this , jol would be fired
this liverpool lineup rn is too strong : 3
liverpool play so fucking good . i think this season champions league they will win lah :o
if she supports liverpool she's too old for you bro .
oh myy the football liverpool playing :o .....
our passing is a nightmare for fulham .

liverpool have turned this into a training session
no body beside me | you'll never walk alone * gombal liverpool *
remember when we beat fulham 2-5 at craven cottage two seasons ago and maxi scored a hat-trick ? loved that match .

why would i watch liverpool game especially when they are in the sort of form .
i know there playing liverpool but i think fulham are contenders for the drop 
on a train during liverpool's game for the second week running ffs , great planning as always
liverpool playing very well
this is turning really bad 
media say we haven't gone to a big team & won . since spurs away loss , we've beaten bvb , bayern , spurs , liverpool + napoli without conceding .
even skrtel has scored 
what a good start for liverpool .... yeahh
liverpool e don do na ... yes u now have the 2nd position we don agree
12 attempts already from liverpool .
sturridge busy flourishing at liverpool
this is vintage liverpool . one touch passing , great movement , wave after wave of attack . a joy to watch . 
liverpool playing some good football .
this is excellent stuff by liverpool .. seriously the best football i've seen for years ! hope they can carry this on .
jol could be fired at half-time well he would be if daniel levy & paul kemsley were in charge at fulham
daddy and i are watching liverpool play on the new tv
haven't seen a worse team performance against liverpool this season ! fulhams goalie the only one that wants it
as good as we are playing , fulham are diabolical !
commentator saying liverpool are at there best ... not really mr. theyre still yet to get suarez and studge involved consistently .. thats scary
liverpool's game is live right now
liverpool are playin some stuff :)
hate liverpool . :p
liverpool is on fire , fulham's defense is missing
come on fulham , let in a few more . goal difference could be vital for us at the end of the season .
are u barcelona in disguise , liverpool ?
liverpool playing some magical football
one touch is so easy against fulham
 using 4 training ! 
32´ 0-0 34´ 0-0 19´ 0-0 34´ 2-0 34´ 2-0 
last night was sickk now off to liverpool should be another good night :)
liverpool are just passing it through fulham so easily . berbatov is just isolated upfront and can't do anything and this is looking easy
liverpool have changed so much this season , such a good side
scary to think could win the league !
fulham all over the place , liverpool running riot . this is what i'm talking about . 
liverpool making a good case for themselves this season
fulham allowing liverpool have them . save to say they're going down . 
liverpool !!
unbelievable link up play liverpool 👏
gutted for fulham this season mind , always had a soft spot for them
fulham are garbage . i'm taking nothing away from this in terms of assessing us . cos they're * that * bad .
fulham , you disgust me .
liverpool absolute dominating fulham here , jol's out in the morning is my guess
fulham are deeper than whitney houston's bath .
do any of the fulham defenders want to do something ? ball-watchers
liverpool shaaa but see how fulham shaaa too much
liverpool and southampton both 2-0 up . happy saturday !
2 - fulham last managed more than one goal in a league game at anfield in october 1966 . over .
liverpool playing delightful today , great showing today
keep calm and love liverpool :)
fulham are poo . martin jol's a gonna .
liverpool having a joll , i see
liverpool playing with the kind of joy and exuberance that naturally accompanies games against fulham .
liverpool is getting after it
flipping between southampton , madrid , and fulham . yet the main nbc channel has the most boring team in chelsea on . oh , its 0:0 .
can we please play against fulham every week ? 
liverpool are like barcelona today
how can i be missin d liverpool match
this game is more about liverpool being excellent rather than fulham being anything . 
we are all over fulham
no team could match liverpool right now ..
liverpool are presenting a footballing masterclass against fulham , great to watch .
not sure if i'm watching liverpool or barcelona . lolxd . fantastic play by lfc
glen johnson is so important to this liverpool team . he makes a massive difference
liverpool passes are nice
at the moment , fulham's defense line resembles arunachal pradesh's border . constantly infiltrated and the man in charge does nothing about it
good to see not just flop after losing to 
it's a strange feeling knowing that , for once , it can be enjoyable to be a liverpool fan . hopefully , this run of form continues .
what a try by sturridge . liverpool's play brimming with confidence .
good job liverpool 
we've got fulham next . a team on a bad run ...
fulham will def sack martin jol
liverpool . boooo
skrtel !! 2-0 ! could run riot here ! fulham wide open . 
liverpool ... 👏
2-0 pour liverpool
 are in a rampant mood , the really want to destroy 
 playing some great 1 touch football . get a 3rd b4 ht and this could be a cricket score 
liverpool are a joy to watch these days 👌
 looking really good against a poor side . keep it up
liverpool playing class
fulham are a joke shop 
as much as i'm impressed with how we're playing , you have to say that fulham are seriously awful .
liverpool and southampton are absolutely flying ... are we in for another bad week ? :(
liverpool main cantikk siot * thumb finger *
what odds a fulham/palace relegation double ?
when glen johnson and enrique plays ... liverpool is totally different . 
the football liverpool are playing right now yh . off to have a wank ( y )
liverpool playing superbly .
liverpool plays some awesome soccer
liverpool should go on scoring spree sia
suarez you need to show up today .. not just for liverpool but for my fantasy league squad
fulham are making it so hard for us fans to remain positive , however we've been through worse and stuck together 
liverpool is on fire
i dont get it i post the liverpool goals first within a minute of the goals and still get no views crazy
i'm following " liverpool vs fulham " with 308 other 
great to see us whipping the first time passes around , fulham looking dreadful though
liverpool has missed coutinho
if we put 5 or 6 past fulham martin jol may be out of a job in the morning ...
serious nice liverpool main .
waaww waaww liverpool two goals ...
liverpool playing some beautiful football
if johnson and coutinho were available last week liverpool might not lost against arsenal
martin jol is managing his last fulham game
liverpool we do this !
disappointed in my fellow junction chelsea fans they didn't succeed in securing the tv room .. now liverpool fans are there( ". _ . )
kacaniklic is feeling dizzy after seeing liverpool play such brilliant football .
i once went to a fulham game cause it costed us £2 each
 players throwing themselves at the ball when fulham players are just trying to get it clear ! out to prove something after last week !
liverpool pretty irresistible against fulham right now .
i love you liverpool . i love you so much . i love you more than food .
liverpool playing awesome passin :) thats the way
 fulham don't look threatening even when they are with the ball , poor performance all round
the return of jonno and coutinho has revitalised the side . imagine when enrique returns as well ... but i guess fulham are pretty shite .
are you watching barcelona ??!! 
outstanding passing and moving today but goals come from setpieces . fulham aren't good but we're looking great . 
liverpool are rampant
this is liverpool i know !!!
oh my life !!! i need to get rid of this woman's horn !! every liverpool game i hear this damn thing 
2-0 already liverpool flying
my timeline is all about liverpool . * lost *
fulham are awful now . martin jol will get the sack .
think today might be the end for martin jol at fulham
makes me laugh when some liverpool fans say they don't need gerrard .
what you want are two mobile strikers that have great chemistry , and liverpool have just that . 
really don't want to know what the final score is going to be today . liverpool 11shots in 30 minutes ....
timeline all on liverpool . i loike .
nice liverpool ! one direction
liverpool mean business .
get 5 liverpool its fulham
c'mon liverpool !! nothing better than seeing us win the games we drew or lost last term 
fucks sake liverpool why has sturridge not scored yet .
liverpool playing some good stuff here - could be 4 or 5 already . 
2-0 liverpool keep it going 
he doesn't have a goal yet but stephen gerrard is basically beating fulham by himself right now . 
fulham actually have a decent team just need a new manager
burasi anfield road ! liverpool liverpool .
fulham are soooo wack lol
liverpool 2 0 fulham chealsea 0 0 weast b
liverpool looking fantastic today
liverpool lookin good so far .
liverpool 2-0
the week after yahoo ! published an article entitled ' is it time liverpool benched steven gerrard ?' he gets two assists in 25 minutes . no .
keep calm and watch liverpool destroy fulham , just keep calm !
go liverpool go
how jol is still in charge of fulham is well beyond me . should have been cut loose last season .
5 games is running now vs vs hcfc vs vs vs 
good passing movement by lfc to give sturridge a chance to shoot but wide . 34 ' liverpool 2 fulham 0 -lam
this zvertovic guy from fulham is quite decent ... 
bayern up 2-0 and liverpool is up 2-0
love martin jol for what he done for us , but his time is up at fulham
liverpool
fucking fulham playing so rough
liverpool rampant , fulham rather clueless really 
gonna be a long old day for all the muggy fulham fans up in liverpool 
remember when we beat fulham 10-0 in the cup
hopefully this won't be the coffin destined nail for martin jol , without him fulham will surely revert to a less fun gungho team
i told you , liverpool to win 10-0 at 500/1 was a good idea
halftime in the fulham dressing room . captain to manager : " dad ! i fink i got it wrong again !"
there's no word to describe how amazing liverpool are omg
stevey g . what a champ 💪
liverpool play contre qui ? 
why doesn't taarabt start for fulham
cheers to my team liverpool , we still need 2more goals , sas=goals
i love liverpool but idk . i love ronaldo :-((((((
so liverpool won't be dropping points then . fuck ..
always makes me feel better when both liverpool and southampton are winning
good start from liverpool👌⚽️
ok i say this every year ..... i think this could be liverpool's year to win the league ?.....
liverpool is playing amazing i'm so proud of them let's go reds !
already liverpool's best performance all season . some unbelievable play .
liverpool playing beautiful football atm , look unstoppable . 
fulham just go to show that you need everyone working and not just 5/6 players ! they are absolutely muck !
what went through my mind to put 1-0 ?! liverpool are top , fulham are absolute shit , at least it was free
i love everything about fulham . i love playing them . i love craven cottage . i love how genial they are .
come on liverpool keep it at 2 nil !
fulham dying . hahaha . liverpool not giving any chance .
4-4-2 rogers ! can't you see that it's working so much better ? admittedly , it is against fulham ...
maybe dempsey does go on loan to fulham
hate liverpool
liverpool is having a good game still
liverpool are 2 up v fulham and southampton are 2 up v hull .
goal ! lfc 3 fulham 0 . this time it's luis suarez .
fulham are so shit ... grandads goin mad
when liverpool team is playing , to my husband i become one of the house walls .... i'm walking alone at the moment !
we are running fulham to the ground , should be 5-0 already this ..
the union and fulham must use the same training drills for defending set pieces .
liverpool to lead before 30 minutes lands at nice odds . no doubt about it , they're best form comes in the first half .
it would be good for the team if gerrard was dropped for the fulham game , they said ...
nothing more satisfying than liverpool winning
liverpool 3-0
oh the way i love fulham .
shame we haven't got fulham anytime soon . they r rolling over and taking a hiding every week . be surprised if jol lasts much longer
3-0 liverpool
okay qilah . heads up on liverpool .

the ease with which liverpool are brushing aside opposition this season is scary 
i said it at the start of the season , fulham have bought players who are past their prime ( bent , berbatov , parker etc) , asking for trouble .
liverpool so clinical and ruthless in front of goal this season , such a contrast to last season with all the frustrating draws ......

well done liverpool keep on scoring 
liverpool are on fire !!!
trying to keep up with the liverpool and real madrid scores . busy .
superb play by liverpool inside 30 mins wif the scoreline 3-0 up
yes ! liverpool smashing it 👌
liverpool turn up ! !!!!
fulham need to get relegated
the only fulham player who can come out of this looking half decent today is the keeper . its awful seeing a team im so fond of play terrible
everytime liverpool score , southampton jus sayyin " buh we can do tht too " loool
come on now fulham , put some bloody effort in ! 
ok all the games are moving too fast today . liverpool and southampton both 3 up already too ???
if people ask you what mediocre is , point them towards fulham .
looks like fulham are going to take another pasting today . no pressure 
really quite glad liverpool didn't swap henderson for dempsey
liverpool 3 fulham0 . only the first half
come on liverpool !! 
liverpool up 3-0 already . this game is full of goals , yet terribly dull .
if liverpool score 10 goals in this match , i will 10people 1k each . it's 3-0 now .
will liverpool fans be rooting for man utd tomorrow ?? never thought i would ever live to see it
fulham may as well just start digging their graves
i think a sacking in the pl will come this evening 
3-0 liverpool | 4-0 real madrid ! 😍😍
liverpool's best , suarez . city's best , aguero . united's best , rooney . arsenal's best , ozil . chelsea's best , mata ! - . -
jol ... you're getting sacked in the mornin !!!!! haha youre shit
gutted for jol . fulham were never gonna beat united and liverpool , but these two games are probably gonna be the nail in his coffin . 😥👴
he just had to . it's not a liverpool win without a suarez goal . glorious pass from henderson
why will fulham allow liverpool score 3 goals in 36mins ...
didn't exactly this happen to fulham last week ?
fulham are feeling the pain 
looks like game over already as we take 3-0 lead against fulham !! who else but suarez . now just need other results to go our way 
liverpool three nil up and my accra is currently winning . what is even happening .
liverpool is on fire
see southampton and liverpool scoring
fulham is just worthless ! 3-0 suarez 
setanta competition : what score was liverpools record win v fulham . 10 minutes later commentator talks about the record 10-0 win .
as much as jol is at fault you'd expect players to actually try . fulham players are a disgrace . the new owner should ask for a refund
i think this is liverpool " payback time " for last week , they play like a super star today .
arsenal chelsea liverpool and southampton that would be my 4
henderson and countinho complete the liverpool midfield
liverpool stop 😂😂😂
fuck sounds like i'm missin a brilliant game here , 3-0 b4 half time and studge still has to score . bad news ahead for fulham
liverpool 3 oldu 
blnje gol ,, liverpool , soton and real had score 3 and more goals before the half time ,, hehehehe

good race between liverpool and southampton here .
how bad are fulham , shocking first half against united last week and again today ! stevie g rolling back the years , must be his new boots
obvious this fulham teams not playing for martin jol so on that basis and the fact there is plenty more goals in this game mr jol 
fulham crumbling like a cookie 
liverpool and madrid destroying their opponents ! a great saturday for me
fulham's fans will be devastated when they get relegated . i feel bad for both of them .
nice lahh liverpool ..
liverpool are bossing this game good to see !!
feel bad for fulham fans , don't think martin jol is the answer
easy easy easy liverpool are playing class

hartson says liverpool playing unbelievable football , what happened last week , o i forgot it was only a dream

liverpool till i die 
fulham on a lets-see-if-we-can-be-more-shite-than-the-previous-week mission
que massaaaacre do liverpool

looking like the liverpool of old at the moment .. 
fulham are so shit these days
surely there are way better players on the liverpool bench than henderson . 
smashing wba and fulham is one thing . let's call this a warm up for future arse , chelski and citeh games 
luis suarez better than torres , he came from ajax to liverpool , he's continental he's fucking mental , so please don't take for luis away !!
what ? fulham are playing l'pool though ...
could place hull and fulham be our saviours if we pick up enough points 
liverpool just piling it on vs . fulham . southampton also up 3-0 on hull . chelsea .... locked into scoreless match with wba .
fulham look really poor by the way .
did martin jol bring the old spurs kit with him to fulham 
fulham has zero midfield . empty defence . lame attacks . that's how liverpool gets an own goal , a goal by skrtel and suarez .
fulham have conceded 3 first half goals in the last two games . they make henderson look like fabregas . 
we shall full their ham with goals 
lool wtf man i come out of the shower and liverpool are winning 3-0
who'd of thunk it , saints and liverpool showing everyone hows its done
can we play fulham every week ? 
you'd swear my dad played for liverpool with the celebrations he does when they score😂😂😂😂

southampton & liverpool dah 3 gol ? this is interesting .
i'm encouraged by this performance ... but let's remember that fulham aren't exactly a good side .

this is why i love liverpool . they always come back .
i'd rather fulham drop out of the premiereship if this is the standard they are going to play
come on liverpool !
wow we are playing well but fulham are shocking .
liverpool are 3 up at home v a team in the bottom 3 who's manager will be sacked before monday . this clearly shows their title credentials .
relegated teams - crystal palace , sunderland and fulham . can't see that changing the way they play currently .
so liverpool leading . no surprises yet as fulham have the worst defense this season . a 5-0 may be what we are looking at here ..
poor martin jol . fulham defend so poorly because he is too much of a laugh in training . no drills , just a 30 man game of wembley .
liverpool \m/
liverpool are such a good team this season , glad to see a celtic win and them winning comfortably🍀🔴
what a joke fulham are these days
liverpool is just killing it !
pull up your shorts fulham lol
sturridge really isn't that good , just that liverpool had no one else . i suppose spurs will be title challengers too !
this is the kind of game that makes liverpool think they're better than they are ... poor fulham .
fulham look absolutely awful
i don't think fullham has a chance against liverpool . 
i hope liverpool won't break city's last week record .

dads turning liverpool game over now to put something shit on i bet , what a dick head

taxi for jol , i think that's the end of martin jols stint at fulham , can liverpool beat man city's 7 from last week ?
the fact england are winning ( both codes) , liverpool are winning and bolton aren't losing has made me feel slightly better .

3-0 to liverpool already ? those calling for a rout must remember palace at home and second half syndrome
sadly , fulham have been better today than over the last 6 months . as long as jol doesn't feel the pressure , it's fine . 
aguero is my captain this week , was a tough choice between him a suarez , lets hope he gets some goals tomorrow . 
easy for liverpool . =)
i can't deal with happy liverpool fans . they've been miserable since 1990 , and i'd like it to remain that way .
poor fulham .. i feel their pain

this is the most fluid formation for liverpool . very balanced in rewards and risks .
martin jol getting sacked before fulham's next game

i'd be very surprised if jol is still at fulham after the international break . 
feel sorry for fulham fans having berbatov in their team , he has one of the worst attitudes the epl has ever seen

southampton nd liverpool are scoring their opposition badly
liverpool looking decent and fulham looking terrible , could really improve our goal difference here
have to feel that suarez won't be at liverpool next year though 
great first half liverpool
perhaps the owner of both the jacksonville jaguars & fulham should just swap the managers/coach and see how they get on . can't do any worse ?
if this was a boxing match fulham would be knocked the fuck out 
liverpool bores me -____-
damn , liverpool plays so smoothly as a team .
liverpool smashing it up !
looks like i got my liverpool prediction terribly wrong too , i said 0-0 today ... running away with it , bye bye jol .
how can liverpool and southampton be like that ... 
liverpool are playing such sexy football ...

" fulham now have to try to avoid 10-0 ", jan on danish tv3+ remembering 1986 : 10-0 in league cup , 2nd round . 4 goals by , 
liverpool are definitely going to win the world cup next year . 
the same liverpool we schooled ? fulham deserve nothing short of relegation .
lovely that's my win cast of suarez and liverpool up :d
liverpool are having a good game ... 3goals in the 1st half so far ...
if it was fifa14 fulham would have to pass the control ...
is the first liverpool goal a definite og or is there any chance it will be credited to suarez ?
fulham on the ropes , waiting to be knocked out !
liverpool tonight
" tenacious " scott parker ambles forward and plays a pass 30 yards from the closest fulham player .

suarez sturridge and couthinio are just tearing apart fulham 
44 minutes and liverpool already got 3 goals !!
with the team they have , fulham should not be as low in the league as they are . jol on borrowed time
fulham needs to get their act together within the season if they want to stay up
venye liverpool r beating teams n last week they seemed a mid table team 
watching the chelsea and liverpool games side by side . no points for guessing which one is more fun !
a dempsey loan to fulham would be a good idea for all parties . 
fulham , hull city , & real sociedad are currently in the same boat ...
sturridge really isn't that good as i said , just that liverpool had no one else . i suppose spurs will be title challengers too !
liverpool 3-0 up in half an hour , and i scored a hat-trick at hockey !! is this the coming of the apocalypse !?!?
liverpool is on fire but they can't beat arsenal
70% possesion , and 3-0 up , exciting times for liverpool fans !

the only good team liverpool have beat this season was a toothless united team . can't wait to see them fail apart against chelsea and city .
wow sunderland can't even beat hull and fulham and they are both 3-0 down in the first half today .
it be one team in the premier league that's playing better soccer than liverpool . and that's arsenal
fulham have been proper shit since they sold dempsey tho
i cant imagine fulham in the championship ..
bayernmunich , dortmund , madrid , chelsea , liverpool . so many matches dont know which to watch

anyone watching the liverpool game will of just seen two very cheeky skills .
we're playing some wonderful stuff against fulham . made some strange noises at a move down the left just then .
lolooll liverpool goal 😁😁😁😁😁
there are some shit fucking teams this year . palace norwich sunderland fulham all utter shit
this fulham match is living proof of what i was talking about re : their midfield . absolutely nothing relevant in the center of the pitch
looks like another goal-fest weekend , with and already 3 goals ahead each against hull and fulham respectively .
don't forget that gerrard is " not a top player " and henderson isn't fit to play for liverpool and sturridge is a " risk ". clueless fools
irresistible liverpool !! 
why didnt liverpool play like this last week

southampton , liverpool and real madrid running riot

" you need a team full of steve sidwells and scott parkers when youre in this type of situation ." scott parker runs , passes ball to liverpool

fulham already losing 3-0 , total joke , berbatov captaining our side 
fulham are total wank today . so no change there then .
3-0 , the reds leker fotboll idag !! 
the lacklustre nature of these fulham performances can't be good for jol !!
the lacklustre nature of these fulham performances can't be good for jol !!
top form liverpool
martin jol has to be out soon , right ? fulham are in disarray .
pl announcers : " luis suarez asked the legendary oscar tabarez to play vs . fulham on the eve of their playoff vs . jordan ."
this is set up perfectly to introduce allen and alberto in the second half and death-by-football jol's fulham career to a close . 
nice to see liverpool up 3-0 on fullham
he bites when he want he scores when he want 
fulham really do have issues , only one tackling midfielder and no runners upfront , lots of flair but no steel , need a busy transfer window .
this liverpool side looks decent ...
supporting liverpool for you today !
so nah liverpool kon dey show skills like this ... idiot people . when dem suppose beat arsenal for me . i go kuku finish the job myself 2mmrw .

some poor teams in the premiership ...... hull and fulham involved in a game that's over before half time !!! 
suarez ! goaaaaaaal 
if suarez isn't credited with the first liverpool goal , that's 2 bets down the shitter already !

keep getting the ball on the right side to hendo and johnson fulham's left is really weak
ya see how much better we are when we can dominate the midfield ? fulham offer nothing in the middle
 + + real madrid all wth brilliant first halvez
it's hard to convey just how much fulham don't seem to care .
liverpool and in particularly gerrard are fucking rinsing
my goodness . can we play fulham every week ?
vintage liverpool first half display ! great entertainment
liverpool showing how to dispose of the smaller sides at home . high tempo from that start . 
fear for . utd and liverpool are good teams , but 3 down in 1st half suggests lack of passion . how long can jol last w/o team behind him ?
liverpool and southampton are on a vexing mode today
is there any point in fulham ?
liverpool are on fire !

idk whyee butt dad n mom hates liverpool ! argg . they prefer manchester united . - . -
fulham is a useless team sha , win over them now sounds useless imo
decent start by liverpool - 3-0 after 40 minutes 
 fulham looks vulnerable at the back , each time liverpool attack it looks like they are going to score its just too easy
top , top work by liverpool so far . keep at it , lads ! 
liverpool game is so entertaining . i like
liverpool back to winning ways arsenal was just a bad strain of herpes . 
girls who are passionate liverpool fans and love football are amazing

almost another goal for liverpool . nice play by sturridge and coutiinho
liverpool is dominating right now .. 
liverpool ahead by 3 goals . still below arsenal on the log !
liverpool are playing so well , gerrard is pinging them as well 
fulham .. what formation are they playin ? 9-1-1 ? i can see like 7-8 fulham players in the box ... -_-
fulham are playing poor but lfc are playing with such confidence its amazing to watch , such enjoyment !
liverpool 🔥
ano this is only fulham but this is stunning football
i've seen plays better than this fulham side , honest to god plays !
fulham should blame arsenal for this game . hahaha

fulham are shit jol will get sacked
god , love to play fulham right about now .. we would rip them apart . they're making liverpool look like the harlem globetrotters of football
could've watched southampton , could've watched liverpool , instead stupidly decided for chelsea where nothing has happened first half
berbatov was told to play upfront and shut down the liverpool defenders on the ball . he's playing up front and shutdown 
i would honestly suggest the ball has spent between 5-10 minutes in the liverpool half so far 
liverpool is on fire tonight !! 
kemon liverpool
where's everyone watching the liverpool match , any good links ?
it's hard to say anything nice about fulham at the current situation
i'm totally sick of soccer .. but wen liverpool plays no excuse
saints and liverpool ... 
 liverpool contolling the whole game
on this day , in 2004 , liverpool signed 2 veryime to take those dreams for the rush of passion's fire , - survivor ,
nearing half-time , saints lead hull 3-0 , and liverpool lead fulham 3-0 . chelsea on the other hand ...

fulham don't seem to care much for the rest of this match , they should just call ' mercy ' at the half .
liverpool 3-0 up in the first half yesss 😂
does kasami for fulham even know he has to defend ? so much space on our right hand side for johnson/hendo to attack ! 
am worried about the resurgence of liverpool and arsenal by the time teams like man united wake up those two would be long gone with points
fulham look shocking , should bag a few more goals today 
liverpool's play is just awesome la
chelsea , liverpool&arsenal is the best !!
feel bad for fulham . they're not shitty , not good just in between , mediocre .

shame martin jol won't still be in charge when we play fulham in december . 
fulham got men like berbatov , bent , ruiz , taraabt and struggling so

liverpool 1st team is not the best with marquee signings n superstars but it's well balanced and solid . only their bench could use some work
liverpool should've played this way last week .
11 men from fulham are currently being raped at liverpool .
liverpool are becoming scary ..
fulham so poor mike myers might get a game for them if he brought his boots to anfield
used to like amorebieta at bilbao . fulham seem to have fucked him up .
nothing more stressful than a 0-0 game . especially when liverpool & southampton are both up 3 bloody 0 
austin powers is a liverpool fan ?
did not know mike myers ( austin powers ) was a liverpool fan 
36 ': real madrid 4-0 , liverpool 3-0 , southampton 3-0 ?!!?!

liverpool fc is up 3-0 yesssss

it'd seem that , to every top team fulham plays against , it's increasingly become a question of how many goals they can concede to them . easy
liverpool are kicking fulham's ass
big half needed for fulham or else it's curtains for jol 
why have fulham even turned up today !
shhhhhhhhhhiiiit mike myers watching the liverpool game
liverpool battering teams at anfield again , nice to see , 
liverpool basically played like barcelona in that first half

buset madrid 4 gol liverpool 3 gol , mantep
not too long ago , liverpool were chasing amorebieta . 
nice of fulham not to bother . hope we get allen , alberto and sterling on second half . 
i know we didn't expect a result from united or liverpool , but i don't think it's unfair to assume the team would actually turn up .. 
nice one there liverpool .
brilliant this from liverpool .
liverpool aren't enjoyable when my brother supports fulham ..
add time 2 menit .. lfc 3-0 fulham

great first half boys let's keep a clean sheet . liverpool 3-0 fulham 
fulham have been shocking but i still think they will survive .
have never seen liverpool play such beautiful football . sadly its only against fullham .
as kidderminster , liverpool and southampton fan , today has been a very good day . coyr , coys .
eto'o en racha . liverpool arrasando . los resultados en anfield & stamford bridge obligan al arsenal a sacar puntos en old trafford .
is liverpool a better side than last season or the season before ? yes .. 
i might get a liverpool shirt with skrtel on the back . it would be my shirtel
always good to see liverpool fc fucking up another team
martin jol's fulham is shit 
liverpool are just controlling fulham ..
morning prep involving epl and good breakfast . reds taking it to fulham , chelsea in a game . watch and learn

luis suarez better than torres , suarez , lfc 3 - 0 fulham * beer *
mike myres at the liverpool game , that's enough entertainment there 😂😂 !!

i think jol would of picked anyone but liverpool to play today
austin powers is a liverpool supporter ha

martin o'neil jumped to the republic job too quick looks like there could be a vacancy at fulham tomorrow !!
austin powers is a fan ? 
why couldn't liverpool have had agger , johnson & coutinho last week against arsenal ! would of been a different game & result !
tot ziens . wonder if fulham will make history and sack their manger during half time of a game . 
liverpool is playing so well
it'd seem that , to every top team fulham plays against , it's increasingly become a question of how many goals they can concede . easy .
game over for fulham , sociedad .. ronaldo is better than neymar but messi is the best in the world ..
berbatov is too good for fulham
fulham gonna get wrapped
 has not got long left . this team is shambolic
why is sen. fred thompson managing fulham ?
fulham are worse than crystal palace
will out be a game of two halves or will we keep going and smash fulham's back doors in
i know everyone loves martin jol but this fulham team is just awful , surely it is time for a change ? bring back coleman !
liverpool too
at this rate i doubt martin jol will make it to next week as fulham manager 
embarrassing being a fulham fan at times 
if oni liverpool played like this last week
why is err'body praising liverpool for being in the lead ? c'mon look who they're playing ..
first half : real madrid 4-0 real sociedad . liverpool 3-0 fulham

fulham left-back : it must be a hell-game .. :))) 
what a first half from liverpool it's not who reds are playing its a top notch first half from us
last year fulham finished behind us just by goal difference . what has happened .
liverpool 2nd half though , we know they can't keep a clean sheet .
" fulham need a midfield full of sidwells and parkers " 1 ) that is their midfield 2 ) no they don't , they both suck
half-time : liverpool are well on their way to three points at anfield , courtesy of skrtel , suarez and a fulham own goal 3-0 
austin powers is a liverpool fan ! :d
i wonder if martin jol fancies selling life insurance ? 
fulham doing so badly , as berbatov adding no value to my , thank god i got suarez

as good of a manager he is , martin jol won't remain fulham manager for too long . results haven't been going their way as of late .
1st half with 3 goals . satisfied enough ! good job liverpool !!
this is the party , yeah , goal party in liverpool !
fulham are really really bad lol

brilliant first half but in fairness fulham don't want to know about it . henderson playing super . gerrard's nutmeg on berbatov 🙈😂 
as much as in that opening half . gerrard controlling and playing well , largely because fulham have had minimal possession , johnson ...
wow liverpool
thank god there's some real shitty teams in the prem this season . fulham should avoid the drop based on that alone
damn it , i can't talk trash about fulham , they already play like trash . fuck , i just complimented them .

jol is gna get the sack defo first united ate them alive and now liverpool it hasn't been a good few weeks for them anyways ...
what the hell happen tl fulham .... alfayed knew !
as angry as supporters are at the moment , it's highly doubtful result here at anfield will spell jol's end . ht 3-0 
 fans on 606 last week had a point , their team just look disinterested and look clueless in possession . 
feel too bad for fulham & sociedad
great 1st half ... henderson really impressing me ... 3 - 0 
i'm going for dinner with a fulham fan tonight . hope it's finger food as knives may be dangerous .
oh champione ! the one and only . we're liverpool . 
 and are fierce this season .....
have fulham even recorded a shot yet ?
smart goal from lfc .. half time .. 3-0 vs fulham .. 
useless fulham . these players shouldn't be payed their wages for the next one month .
here's to hoping we pile the pressure on more in the second half 
liverpool thrashing fulham , could easily be 5 before half-time . 
if tony pulis is in line for the fulham job , keep jol !!! 
imagine the carnage if arsenal , tottenham , liverpool and southampton all finished in the top 4 this season 🙉
ffs liverpool scored 4 against wba ... now they have scored 3 against fulham ... but we , we are struggling to get many goals like old days
come liverpool ! go out there and kick more ass ! 
liverpool beating up on fulham . 3-0 at half , ouch .
hope fulham go in to administration
wow is my wonderful team playing wonderfully ! go liverpool ! 3-0 at the half ! wow ! 
liverpool with 71% of possession ... lovely to watch but fulham are pathetic !
liverpool 3 fulham 0 ... good play by liverpool
liverpool are looking like a proper top four 4 team today 
liverpool is ahead by 1 goal difference ryt now . 
not expecting anything amazing at anfield , but 3-0 at ht ... fulham haven't turned up . i love my club , something needs to change 
half time !!!! good score !!! 3-0
ivanovic crosses are more predictable only to liverpool fans delusion

chelsea needed to score more goals otherwise liverpool will took 2nd placed .
get the fuck in liverpool 
is it me or is there more dross than ever in prem atm 
liverpool !!
before the game , i predicted 7-0 liverpool . i am well aware we are the worst team in this league by a mile . championship bound .
liverpool playing unbelievable . defence so solid with johnson attacking well . gerrard passing brilliant . henderson and coutinho destroying .
descanso : chelsea 1-0 west brom / liverpool 3-0 fulham /
jordan henderson and luis suarez both created 4 chances in the first half with henderson getting an assist 
we need to take advantage of the fact fulham is giving us spaces to bulk up our goal difference . also , gotta keep a clean sheet please !
fulham have been so poor this season
utter domination from liverpool !!! 👍😊
possession : liverpool 71% , fulham 29% 
i'm really enjoying the game but why is fulham so fucking bad ?

reminder that liverpool were 3-0 up at ht v palace and then lost the second half 1-0 .
really enjoyed that first half , been playing some really good football ! expecting fulham to play for damage limitation in the 2nd half !
watching liverpool in a bar .. woow so wonderful liver lead the game with three goal .... never thought most bars are liva

good to see liverpool up 3-0 at the half . feels like it has been ages since i sat and watched an entire match .
celtic win , liverpool winning , ahh cracking footballing weekend .
important liverpool bounced back today , but they have to win against the big teams .
southampton look brilliant definitely top 7 standard . fulham are muck would be delighted if they went down 
no ! decide to study and the half time score is liverpool 3:0 fulham ?? 
good job liverpool 
ht liv 3-0 ful : suarez has scored in his last four pl home matches for liverpool , first player to do so since dirk kuyt in march - may 2011 .
liverpool are battering fulham .... another 3 points thanks .
liverpool ... why ?
all i see is rape on my tl .. madrid , liverpool and southampton ... it's too much and there is another 45mins coming up ..
arsenal will be trophyless again this season , liverpool will be under 4th place as always .
still at least we can't lose next week .. 
fulham should just equalise and take the lead !!!
keep it going man ! 
bwoy suarez kick in two .. liverpool a drop 3 at half time
lets destroy fulham 2nd half and up our goal difference , might need it come the end of the season !
let's go ! 
just got home n liverpool is murdering fulham .
why didn't liverpool council invite mike myers to turn on liverpool's lights last night ?
oh the champione the one and only for you liverpool 
what does a liverpool fan do after winning a trophy ...?? turn off the playstation hahahahahaa

unrelated to liverpool . adam lallana . what a player . rodgers sign him up !
liverpool and saints both 3-0 up at ht . can't complain ! 
first half liverpool 3 - fulham 0 .. ( own goal , skrtel , suarezzz )
liverpool wining 3-0 .
come on liverpool . 3-0
wouldn't it be amazing if the top 4 consisted on arsenal , everton , liverpool and southampton ! definitely the form sides in the bpl right now
all the liverpool fans on my tl really need to chill man , y'all ain't proven no critics wrong so far unlike my ' lil gunners (:
 are looking much better under this formation than under the 3-5-2 ; although it does help that fulham are leaving us with acres of space
does fulham's new nfl owner know there are actual repercussions to having an awful season ? you aren't gifted a better draft pick dude .
liverpool 3-0 fulham . wohoooooo . nice play from liverpool . nice to watch too :d
well played lfc first half was awesome keep it going in 2nd half , please dont sit back & let fulham play & coutinho what a player 
rampant first half from liverpool . 
it's hailing in liverpool !! wtf ! i guess it won't be long till the snows here ! ❄❄⛄⛄
fulham haven't been able to exert any control of space , playing a low , passive block . plenty of opportunities for shots in zone 14
liverpool scoring all the goals they should have scored against arsenal .
descanso en inglaterra . chelsea 1-0 west bromwich liverpool 3-0 fulham aston villa 0-0 cardiff city southampton 3-0 hull city

half-time : aston villa 0-0 cardiff , chelsea 1-0 west brom , liverpool 3-0 fulham , southampton 3-0 hull
wouldn't mind seeing danny murphy as manager . knows his football , actually likes fulham & would get these muppets playing .
ahhhhh beautiful game ... liverpool makin up for last weekends loss 
come on liverpool ! get that three points :) 
bah liverpool ?! -_-
last tweet , i promise : fulham will have 14 pts from the last 19 prem matches . that's half a season well below relegation form ( 1/2 )
so liverpool winning 3 - 0 , were contenders for league title deffo , 
liverpool 3 fulham 0 looks promising first-half
ht liverpool 3-0 fulham . dominating first-half from liverpool . skrtel and suarez each on the score-sheet with an own goal opening the scoring
3-0 up against fulham and all i want is for to double their tally . 
i think i have a bet on 4-1 liverpool
in my mind its liverpool vs . arsenal ... she gets it , i think ...
liverpool on a rampage
saints now back down to 4th after chelsea and liverpool have now scored , but for a moment , just for a moment , they were 2nd .
for sure he's watching his liverpool match right now
liverpool thrashing fulham , could end up being 5 or so . 
you never walk alone :) liverpool ~ 
umm is any american station broadcasting the liverpool fulham match ?

knew i should of took liverpool and southampton
liverpool rules .
 half time : fc 1 eto'o 45 " brom 0 ; 3 0 ; 3 city 0 
1 word for liverpool . " wow "
what an amazing first half in the liverpool and fullham game ! 
we are playing well but fulham are also super shite lol
teams like fulham should just go down . wth !
man city defeated norwich 7-0 last week , can liverpool or southampton get anywhere near that today ? 
the most shots a liverpool player has taken in a match this season is eight : suarez v west brom . coutinho already has seven .
wish my team were in fulham's position , calling for jol's head when they are an average team . have been struggling way before he took over !
liverpool playing some proper footie .
let's all suck off because they're beating fulham ... how'd they get on last night against a proper team ? 
liverpool is having a pretty good season
ht 3-0 . liverpool lead at the break comfortably against fulham . suarez amongst the scorers .
reds is on ,... we're lead 3-0 in first half from fulham
rt if you're a liverpool fan 
come on liverpool what a game :) 
liverpool liverpool
i'd like either liverpool or chelsea to drop points before tomorrow's game . liverpool have slyly wrapped it tho
mesti wis fans e liverpool alay alay
yes liverpool 🌚🌚🌚🌚
now that liverpool are 3 goals ahead please suarez get injured for 2 weeks 😂😥
3-0 to liverpool at half time . very nice
epl half time : southampton 3-0 hull city ; aston villa 0-0 cardiff city ; chelsea 1-0 west brom ; liverpool 3-0 fulham .
true , this is fulham , but when suarez decides he's going to stay on his feet , can mount a fairly potent attack .
 - half-time scores : aston villa 0-0 cardiff , chelsea 1-0 west brom , liverpool 3-0 fulham , southampton 3-0 hull "
i'm still angry that adam , downing & carroll were starters at liverpool not so long ago . ruined us .
are playing good football and deserving of their lead or fulham just poor ??
you make me happy when skies are grey !... oh pleaseeeeeee don't take my liverpool away !!!
was in brogans fulham broadway from midday , amazing atmosphere and one of the best footballing days of my life
liverpool is sooo lucky to have a player like suarez
fulham are in trouble this year
liverpool 
how can berbatov captain fulham ?! he does absolutely nothing ! 
liverpool had 70% possession in the first half .
hebat la liverpool
second week running and fulham are 3-0 down at half time . embarrassing as there appears to be no fight . think i'll go for the managers job .
liverpool is impressive . gerrard is having great influence in the game . and a good one too .
liverpool are like orcas right now , they're just toying with their prey . 
playing awesome but let's remember fulham are shite !
love watching liverpool when they play like this 
madrid dan liverpool mengila x_x
real madrid 4-0 sociedad liverpool 3-0 fulham southampton 3-0 hull city those are the first half results !! where is the defense ?!
nothing puts me in a better mood than liverpool playing well
not that liverpool are good , it's just that fulham are terrible ! 😏
memang cun liverpool main first half .
what's with all these talk about jol getting sacked ? fulham are 2 spots away from the relegation zone aren't they ? 
liverpool giving out the ripper
3-0 to liverpool sharks !!!!
loving the response from the players i know its only fulham but we need to be ruthless
is it liverpool or barca i really can't tell 
fulham are bloody awful
good first half for liverpool , now can we do what we failed to do all season ; keep consistent in the second half

saying that , liverpool are once again playing some sublime football at home . just need to replicate this away from anfield
it isn't going well with fulham at the moment . lack of organisation in midfield and defense . 
at times liverpool do look the best attacking side in the league .
ht : a villa 0-0 cardiff city , chelsea 1-0 west brom , liverpool 3-0 fulham , southampton 3-0 hull city , c palace 0-0 everton ( after 30 mins) .

hey ! crystal palace hanging in against the lesser liverpool team
my moods on match day really depend on the liverpool result
liverpool's possession play and attack so far has been superb . . . .
an excellent saturday morning with real madrid winning 4-0 at the half ; fulham are losing 0-3 though , so it's not all roses . 
chelsea and liverpool are both leading at half time . they will win both today , for sure .

let's all suck off because they're beating fulham ... how'd they get on last week against a proper team ? 
much as i hate liverpool , they have a f'in sick striker in suarez
3-0 at half time not bad liverpool !
who are liverpool ?
fulham , much like that girl from your year in high school , is letting everyone finger them .
some liverpool fans make me laugh uno some of them are deluded at times
liverpool southampton madrid rampant goals 3 3 and 4 respectively 
i like martin jol and sacking off the back of man utd and liverpool results would be harsh but it's looking more and more inevitable . 
great half for liverpool
how are your bets looking at half-time today ? we had southampton , chelsea , liverpool and villa , not sure if villa will come through for us !
cum on liverpool keep it going 
if you still don't think liverpool can make top 4 , your probably a man united fan and your life sucks right now . 
still top of the league . 😁😁😁 liverpool ? what ?

my god , liverpool had stunned fulham by 3 goals only just in 45 minutes . gila la dorang ni .
how is martin jol still incharge at fulham ?
liverpool possesion first half 71% . over 300 passes with 89% accuracy . 
you can not count on fulham at all this season . they need to be relegated . pile of shit team . blaming jol . its the players . lazy bastards

mannn i just see some tickets to liverpool vs west ham
even if it is fulham playing poorly , have taken full advantage & have the game by the scruff of the neck . 
wow liverpool i'm impressed

suarez scored liverpool's 100th goal against fulham in league football .
i want either arsenal or liverpool to win the league . man utd is corrupt & man city and chelsea are only good because of there rich owners
strongest first half liverpool have had this season , really want sturridge & coutinho to bag some goals now
sialah , i love liverpool's build up play . so much .
that crazy moment when fulham's fernando amorebieta scores an own-goal & points a blameful finger at the ginger head of one steve sidwell .
why are sky sports not showing chelsea or liverpool's game ?! could kill some time off if the games were shown . :/
liverpool leading 3-0 at halftime , barca and pirates to complete super weekend
fulham are going to be on trouble this season ! suarez captain in fantasy football though 👌
tremendously boring coverage of the liverpool game with kevin kilbane & matt holland ! mike myers in the crowd is the highlight so far !
yeah liverpool have been pretty good today but there's a serious gulf in quality in the premier league this year
lucas has completed 44/44 attempted passes in the opening half against fulham ; 100% pass completion .
liverpool first half 3-0 already ahh . waahhh but arsenal still 1st ;)
meanwhile liverpool are running riot
we love u liverpool , we do ! 45 min & 3:0 !
liverpool ♥♥☺
fulham a flicky , tricky , pub team , awful . decent , but fulham's cluelessness is the 3-0 .
so happy we are winning own goal skrtel and suarez come on 
liverpool looking lively and creative ! 
suarez or torres when he was at liverpool ?

liverpool an southampton are on it
liverpool winning , bayern winning and southampton winning ... perfect day

there is a requirement to be fair in coverage , but there's only so many minutes these pundits can spend going over fulham's 3 shots on goal

a lotta people forget how important a player glen johnson is in the liverpool set up .. especially in attack .. 
i think i picked the wrong match to watch . chelsea are sooooo dry ! should have watched liverpool/fulham
fulham's getting tortured 3-0 and stekelenburg is trending on twitter ! that'll boost his morale , i'm sure ! 
liverpool 3 0 fulham chelsea1 0 westbrom southhapthon3 hull0
having said that , fulham is piss poor . take nothing away from our performance , but the opponent is basically awful .
if your there and there's 800 of you apparently , i feel for you . we looked good for 22 minutes . ;( 
havent scored a league goal this season yet they still have more points than liverpool , spurs and real madrid
liverpool are running riot against west brom like we did in the 1st half against them . does that make rodgers a managerial god like moyes ?
absolutely crush fulham second half plz
i think every team in epl will beat fulham this season without looking back !!! no wonder man united could beat so easily last time
liverpool on point ... lovely game
up liverpool
if liverpool sort out their midfield in january , we will definitely be looking to stay in the top 4 .
mike myers supports liverpool fc . 
to be fair that was a very very good half but it has to be said fulham are poor today too
arghhhh i follow too many liverpool fans :(

i won´t judge much on this performance as fulham are probably the worst team in the league atm , but the whole team has been brilliant .
delighted that liverpool seem to be able to break down the so called lesser teams this season . been a major problem last few years .
manchester united is becoming the new liverpool , all they have now is " history ."

liverpool are killing it ! :)
liverpool 3-0 yeahhhh
just letting liverpool fans know you are playing fulham yeno that team thats 16th and only have 10 points .

ah , bloody hell . do we have to have a 2nd half ? can't fulham just knock over their king and concede ? 
not sure whether lfc is just tok good or fulham is just too bad . strange

it's been a good first half for liverpool fc 
flighty is the term i'd use for this fulham side . spineless might be a tad strong because they do at least have scott parker .

and we're back here at anfield . liverpool lead 3-0 ; fulham make a change with ruiz entering for kacaniklic .

in berbatov and ruiz , fulham have 2 of the most technically-gifted players in premier league
is it wrong for me to be aggressive towards liverpool fans celebrating in the away end ? i think not . what's your view ?

 liverpool is giving me goose bums ♥
fulham are in trouble this year
liverpool are such a decent side

clubs don't seem to do too well after getting owners from our sub-continent . 
liverpool chelsea and southampton all up . just waiting on everton then real madrid tonight .

oh superb from liverpool ! we win the ball back , great pace going forward and sturridge's shot is saved , suarez hits over the bar . 
losing to the top premier league sides isn't what will get martin jol sacked from fulham , it's the manner of the defeats that will .
jol is gone by full time 
fulham still getting raped i see xd

the second half is not three minutes old and could have scored two more . fulham are all over the place .
2 minutes into the 2nd half and it sounds like liverpool have had 20 chances .
liverpool just can't get that fourth goal
should be 5 ... remember when fulham were a decent side . wtf has happened to them ?
lets all take a minute to remember that liverpool arn't playing midweek matches in europe this year
stekelenberg is the only one is this fulham team worthy of a mention . great keeper .
if i were fulham i would rage quit
sounds like fulham are chasing shadows

big miss : sturridge ghosts through a fulham back four that has taken to jawing at one another ; he slides his shot wide right . ugly . 3-0
liverpool might score like 7 today .
fulham's team is full of ageing , lazy an sub standard players . they won't stay up .
i feel sorry for fulham
like the attitude from liverpool to start 2nd half . don't let up at all . keep the foot on fulham's throat .
madrid ,, liverpool ------> dope
i'm conflicted . liverpool's doing good but dortmund's losing it at the moment . 😐
fulham's getting destroyed here .

rain falling at 3am , wall-to-wall rugby , liverpool up 3-0 and enough coffee to get me through until dawn . could not be more content .
how are liverpool playing ?

this season liverpool is rampant when playing their fixture at home . i've to admit good attacking football . 
wouldn't be surprised if fulham get relegated
swear it should've been like 5-0 liverpool
if as a boxing match it would be stopped . this is a mauling . could be 6 or 7 nil already
manchester united and liverpool are set to go head-to-head to sign benfica midfielder nemanja mati

1st half stats - liverpool v fulham : possession 72% - 28% . shots 17 - 2 . on target 5 - 1 . corners 5 - 2 . fouls 5 - 6 . 
thought 3 or 4 this morning but thinking 6 now ! fulham are shite !
oh great ball from coutinho and sturridge can't get the shot away , goes wide . again , fulham absolutely opened up here . 
i think liverpool are on there training ground
why is fulham so shit this season
a couple of lucky wins disguised it for a while , but we are the worst team in this league 
yes liverpool❤
liverpool playing well today . 
that was a great series of chances . been a long time since i last seen a liverpool side this tenacious , even if it is against fulham .
i prefer liverpool with a 442 formation me thinks . goals goals goals !!!
and again . looks like liverpool want to make it humiliation .
do yourself a favour and watch liverpool play 
fulham have some good players but none of them can be defenders… .
liverpool 3-0 up v fulham at half time . sick

well at least liverpool are taking pity now putting their shots into row z for us
liverpool fans full of fukin shit- 5nilup
fulham keeper is doing so well with another outrageous save
liverpool spunning two great chances in quick succession .
we've played 3 minutes so far and already i can't believe we haven't scored another 3 goals . fulham are awful .
fulham playing like a team who are trying to get their manager sacked
fulham should be relegated by january
mantap ur liverpool . like like .!!! :d
i really think liverpool should be 15-0 up .
nah . same afc that beat liverpool , napoli and dortmund home ? no worries
wow wt a save by fulham goalkeeper 
unstoppable liverpool . 
wish i wasnt on a train right now . we're tearing fulham a new one by the sounds of things .
liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool
liverpool ea ritela !
swashbuckling stuff from liverpool ! 
how can fulham be this crap ? nah they must be trolling !
woulda been 4 nil to liverpool if sturridge isnt the most selfish player in the premier league 
fulham's team is full of ageing , lazy an sub standard players . they won't stay up .
liverpool are absolutely destroying fulham . today is good !
fulham is slacking 0-3 in the first half against liverpool 😕
come on liverpool ! 2nd half .
liverpool denied a 4th goal as sketelenberg comes up with two quick saves in few seconds time ..
liverpool over 2.5 and southampton over 1.5 only took half an hour .. nothing from other 4 games ffs
couple great saves from stekelenburg to deny a fourth for liverpool
liverpool is just on form these days !
c'mon liverpool !!!!
sacking martin jol won't change anything with those shit players 
just got home , time to watch liverpool ............. gud heavens ! we already 3-0 up ! 
loving what are doing . exactly the response needed ! putting fulham to the sword gets us back on track ! walk on you reds ! 
i forgot to mention that bryan ruiz has replaced alex kacaniklic at the break . 3-0 
what i learned so far today : fulham is horrible . 
even though the goals , fulham's keeper is damn good .
stekelenburg honestly is having a decent game , despite fulham losing 3-0 .
the action has resumed , second half of the game is starting well ! 👍 
really if liverpool keep playing like this definitely fulham would be thrashed big time ! 
good first half for liverpool 
liverpool is back liverpool is back ! 
we are absolutely fisting fulham ... united made a fucking meal out of these
why are fulham making liverpool ' look ' like the best team in the world ... 
aiyoh liverpool you could have been 5-0 up already zzzz
liverpool we love u
fulham making liverpool look ridiculously good .
i do not mean to brag but , liverpool f.c live . a whiskey sour in hand and catching up with my good friend mr l . skywalker . enough said .
fulham are fucking useless
taking a break from studies to find liverpool up 3-0 . lovin it ! 
think fulham are going down like , there shite
fulham's back 4 just looks incompetent today
wouldn't surprise me if liverpool finish with 6 or 7 goals
oh boy liverpool , shooting fish in barrels today 
fulham are complete shambles at the back . could have been 5-0 down already .
fulham just get deaded weekly
wwwoooaaahhh . mike myers is a liverpool fan ? groovy baby
i hope fulham get relegated they act like they don't have a beast on the bench
keeps dying in gta coz too busy watching liverpool game
holy liverpool's playing so nice
long time since i've seen liverpool play so well
martin skrtel has erased the memories of may 2012 after his header into own net handed fulham victory at . proudly 
fulham need the sas to stop sturridge and suarez .
liverpool are closer to 7-0 than are to 3-1 .... 
liverpool won't sell us suarez . it's deeper than the money to them
liverpool is just walking around fulham right now . 
liking this liverpool team
liverpool ! liverpool ! liverpool ! 
i don't even think united's defense are as easy to get break down or score against as fulham's is . . .
liverpool is really piercing holes into fulham .
 fulham fans calling for jol sacking is ridiculous . what is their expectation ? fulham are where you'd expect them to be .
one more goal for liverpool here and the scoreline could become ridiculous .
liverpool no estilo wrecking ball .
fulham luckily escaping twice there
 ( j11 ) en juego ( 50 ' ) chelsea 1-0 west bromwich , liverpool 3-0 fulham , southampton 3-0 hull y aston villa 0-0 cardiff
oh man , how annoying must the liverpool seattle twitter be ? liverpool fans * and * from seattle ? ugh .
liverpool r wickd😜😜😜😂
fulham is a disgrace this year
liverpool has a good start with 3-0 . maybe a 5-0 ? (-: 
liverpool defend ur goal 4 me jawe
fulham be like : " fuck this shit . mercy . lad , i said mercy , stop it "
liverpool are going ham
fulham will get relegated . palace were harder to beat than this lot .
lol , liverpool arent going to sell suarez in january . c'mon
worried about fulham this year 
johnson has created more chances alone , than the entire fulham team .
the fulham d-line is really terrible ! if those last shots were in , this game could have been the worst of their season . 
gotta admit , liverpool is playing a good attacking football @
3 gol liverpool tanpa assist/gol dari sturridge . pfffttt
okay , i have some time on my hands . which game do i watch . chelski v wba or liverpool v fulham ? is berba playing for fulham ?
liverpool should be at least 5 or 6 up here , fulham are shocking 
cheer up fulham .... remember you scored a really good goal 3 weeks ago !!
liverpool starting 2nd half same way the 1st half ended . attack attack attack
i want to watch the liverpool fulham match but rma's match is waaay more interesting . lol . 
fulham fans should keep quiet ! what better coach can they get in place of jol ? 
reckon if there are any more goals for liverpool then martin jol will get sacked ..
fulham have to be the most gutless team in english football . had they not picked up parker it would be even worse .
had a sudden horrible premonition liverpool are going to sign carlos vela for 12m in a season or so and he'll be really good .
fulham's goalkeeper is a beast .
leemoodd e raiso streaming liverpool ..
at half time : liverpool 3-0 fulham stays loser
the 3-0 scoreline really flatters fulham . they should be 10-0 down by now . dreadful performance 
martin jol will be sacked soon i'm sure . fulham 3-0 down to liverpool today , could get worse 
fulham are the most pointless football team in the world ...
back on the coach after a great trip to . glad the rain stayed in ! 2013
great night in liverpool yesterday where i finally got to meet a bone-fide hero of mine , only the ruddy pope of trash john waters !
liverpool <3 haha
liverpool and amsterdam have fucked me .
then sturridge hits over from a tough angle from 2 yards . liverpool could have had 3 goals in the first 2mins of the 2nd half .
 liverpool's most solid performance so far ! really delivering a masterpiece 
omg , should be 5 or 6-up already . worrying profligacy ! 
liverpool match 
 are definitely going to be part of the game this season
how much did buy ??
17 attempts on goal for liverpool , that what they need to at home , c'mon lfc 18/7/8/5/3 .
i like fulham and want them to stay up but they're gonna struggle if they give teams this much space in .. well , everywhere !
this is a metal deathcore way from liverpool to begin the second half . keep it up 
fulham are getting bullied here like
they suspended bets on l'pool v fulham after 27mins . so rude lol ..
liverpool are playing like real madrid lol
just ended work .. joining the liverpool match from the 2nd half .. awesome display in the first half to be 3-0 up ... =)
49´ 0-0 47´ 1-0 des 0-0 50´ 3-0 50´ 3-0 
if liverpool can score one more , chelsea score 2 more , wba 1 and palace and everton draw 2-2 ill be 2k up . not asking for much boys !!!!
the way to describe liverpool's midfield today is : at it .
wore liverpool's jersey ytd and today they're on fire 💁
half-time scores aston villa 0-0 cardiff chelsea 1-0 west brom crystal palace 0-0 everton liverpool 3-0 fulham southampton 3-0 hull
why are liverpool so good ?
fulham's team is full of ageing , lazy , and sub standard players . they won't stay up .
fulham are trending ! this can only be good news ! 
liverpool are playing unbelievably well ( y )
fulham should be paying fans to go to away games , not the other way round
what are we going for today ? 6 , 7 , 8-0 to liverpool ?? 
second half ! come on reds , bring 3 point from fulham
liverpool 3-0 up love that
2nd half on the way still liverpool 3 fulham 0 chelsea 1 wesbrom0 soton 3 hull city 0
liverpool's on fire . 
easy 3 points for liverpool . relaxed
liverpool leading again :d
i think for every team in the pl excelling themselves ( liverpool , everton , arsenal , southampton) , there are some absolutely woeful sides
not even 2 minutes into the 2nd half and lfc are mauling fulham . this is the sort of performance that loses a manager a job .
martin jol may not really deserve a sack , how else would it happen playing subsequent games at man utd and liverpool
 still cutting into fulham at the start of the second half 
liverpool are rampant . sas both had great chances already 2nd half . 
respect to the best offense in the premier league 
yes liverpool
more chances are definately going to be misused by liverpool . buzz kill . 
just realized lfc winning 3-0 against fulham ... come on reds score more goals :p
liverpool looking slick against fulham . time for my weekly ' when will jol be sacked ?' tweet . i'm not trying to get him the sack . honest .
just over a quarter of the season in and certain epl teams are showing us who they are , ie liverpool , cardiff , everton , fulham
liverpool vs fulham 3-0 yeaahhh goodluck the reds ^^
seriously fulham didn't come to anfield still stucked in last week defeat

i truly hope liverpool lose really badly tonight

liverpool playing well today
cannot understand why people consider the premier league to be the best league in the world . teams like fulham and palace are just awful atm
this is a liverpool side hungry for goals and high on chemistry , so nice to see again 
forgot how shit this is :( focusing on liverpool score to keep happy
johnson has created more chances alone , than the entire fulham team .
with suarez on the field , don't think liverpool's performance will be any less !
liverpool fans feeling so proud that their team beat fulham .............
feel kind of sorry for fulham , they lost a lot of talent and couldn't replace them . berbatov has a quality shot but he's so lazy .
liverpool could have been 5-0 up
liverpool have had 20 shots , fulham have had 2 ...
are football 4 fold looking good liverpool 3-0 .. southampton 3-0 ... madrid 4-0 ... and chelsea 1-0 
who knows - curbs to fulham ?
martin jol is not long for i'd suggest 
crazy that we're 3-0 up and still frustrated . tells you how dire fulham are .
good job real and liverpool !
the first football match i went to ( excluding bolton ) was liverpool vs fulham at anfield 10 years ago . pretty sure that was 3-0 as well
all the games today , are scoring goals . 3 for liverpool , 4 for realmadrid . .
half-time scores aston villa 0-0 cardiff chelsea 1-0 west brom crystal palace 0-0 everton liverpool 3-0 fulham southampton 3-0 hull
3-0 up at half time improves my mood immeasurably . everyone playing well albeit against a poor fulham team .
had a dream last night that liverpool won this match 6-0 
liverpool have a 5-1-0 record against the bottom half teams , but only 1-1-2 against the top half ones . ( not included today . )
the only other team i'd want to win the league apart from liverpool , would be southampton
liverpool everton brighton and barnsley for £14
we're playing well yea but credit where it is due , fulham are a fucking awful team
liverpool sounding quite good
half-time scores aston villa 0-0 cardiff chelsea 1-0 west brom crystal palace 0-0 everton liverpool 3-0 fulham southampton 3-0 hull 
wish the liverpool game was on instead of chelsea
i thought westbrom and fulham can help us ( arsenal ) kumbe wote ni mayai tu !!!!!!
my cousins in liverpool are really dodgy like seriously
i hope one day i can go to . 
very annoyed at nbc . the live extra feeds of matches can’t say up for longer than 2 minutes . can’t watch liverpool .
switch on tv , liverpool's game . switch off again . waste of time . hehehe
so we r tearin fulham apart n i dint knw 
hopefully , chelsea and west brom draw tonight . 😏😏 go liverpool ! go bebeh * innocent face *
liverpool are dominating !
watching the cmas instead of liverpool simply because of taylor swift
bloody liverpool 😩
liverpool are making me horny atm
the best fulham can do is to dominate the 2nd half and prevent soaking more , as they did to man utd last week
martin jol fired yet ? 
come on la liverpool .
liverpool fans in quandary ..... will they cheer on mufc tomorrow ? ? surely not .....

so i was rambling on and i realized my dad wasn't listening to me because he was watching the liverpool match . zzz
enjoying watching liverpool today . running like clockwork !! 
is it that liverpool's attack is too strong , or fulham's defense is too weak
20 shots ... 3 goals liverpool seriously
sturridge is so unlucky . producing beautiful saves and blocks off fulham .
how do fulham fans not want to punch berbatov ? what a lazy prick !
suarez doesn't even want to be at liverpool .
when i heard dr . evil ...... fat bastard .... and wayne's world ..... i thought man u not fulham were at anfield
what a play from liverpool
liverpool on fire today
liverpool and southampton are cruising
fulham are really terrible . deserve to be beaten by more than 3
the gulf in class between cissokho and the rest of the liverpool players is very evident . he looks very poor .
liverpool are fucking donning !!
liverpool will get 5 at least , fulham are embarassing
liverpool are just playing better and better , it's a thing of beauty !
 pride of liverpool
trying to watch the liverpool match and the federer match at the same time . conflicting emotional states .
fulham playing as though nothing is at stake 
all teams tryin tu improve their goal wen they face fulham smh
shopped out now for a wee starbucks before hitting the city ! 
wouldn't be surprised if there is an in-play sacking of jol . fulham look embarrassing .

who'll replace jol if he does go ? not a lot of managers will want the fulham job

liverpool is sick !!
martin jol in deep thought about what he’s going to do on monday .. don’t think he’ll be at fulham that’s for sure
thats exactly why he's irreplacable at liverpool .
love being a fulham , it's so much fun , everyone should be one .
have fulham stopped being a football club ? 
liverpool playing some good football out there . almost feel bad for fulham . no comeback on the horizon .
liverpool's awesome ! ( y )

taraabt could be playing on the wing for fulham , punishing us for whenever one of our full backs goes on a run but martin jol isn't clever .
 half-time : chelsea 1-0 west brom , liverpool 3-0 fulham
 pride of liverpool !!
would be surprised if jol is still fulham manager at this time tomorrow
i am nearly feeling sorry for fulham here . they are looking like a distressed animal wanting to be put out their misery .
i think because liverpool are not in europe they have focused on the league and have been more successful for it

coutinho takes a shot wide . after gerrard , sturridge and suarez makes it the fulham defense run .

fulham defence really isn't strong and compact , giving players a lot of space in their half .
i just got irritated after seeing liverpool go 3nil up against fulham . just had to stop watching the match .

completely disappointed by anfield . stewards were arseholes , liverpool in away end and home team silent until they scored . why bother ?
can 5sos please come to liverpool/manchester bc london is too far away

united's u21 lost 4-2 liverpool this evening , didn't see the game , but ijust asked a man how much his wooden jaffa cak
fulham are fucking muck
fulham used to have one of the hardest defence to break down .. shocking this season !
liverpool can't score anymore . they are making my super six look better than it actually is .
liverpool four-nil up !
on the way to florida and liverpool are 4 up , happy days !
liverpool pressing like monsters ..
well done liverpool just get the goal difference up and sit back and wait for the other people to produce . good response after last week .
goal liverpool 4-0 fulham ( 54 mins) . luis suarez gets his second of the match , latching on to steven gerrard's pass before slotting in
what is wrong with fulham ? they used to be fully decent .
against dire team , liverpool play well . against decent teams , they struggle . that is the difference in winning league and being out of top 4
deary me what is going on at fulham ?
liverpool clearly bossing fulham 4-0 , suarez is a genius !!
do fulham even do training ? they havent got a bloody clue what to do
maintain liverpool ! !! dun score anymore ....
goal at anfield . i wonder who its gone to ... definitely not fulham . because they're really fucking bad .
liverpool taking in for the league come may ? yes , maybe , no ?
el real madrid y el liverpool golean 4 por 0 . wow , wow , wow ..
liverpool ain't lackin lool chelsea need to score more 😔
goddamn ... liverpool scoring these goals . point differential is growing
the fulham u21 have won the league past 2 seasons and are currently top yet none of their players ever given a chance
mark my words , fulham manager martin jol will be sacked within 24 hours .
dad's hogging the telly with the liverpool match . wish i could watch the chelsea match but i can't say this match isn't entertaining .
liverpool are smashing it
luis suarez scores when he wants ! and steven gerrard gives assists when he wants !! 
penalty call for fulham denied followed by an offside by suarez
 if it wasn't 4 fulham keeper this could be 6-7 nil !!
fulham are so shit . jol is in a right mess with some of the players he has . surely his time is up soon ...
for every goal liverpool score , a goal gets scored in the southampton - hull game .
suarez is liverpool .. sturridge was just warming the front for'i'm
lets make it 10 ! hahaha
goal fest at anfield !! suarez with two goals and an assist !! liv 4-0 fulham
no more goals fulham . i'm begging !
goal suarez ... liverpool go 4-0 up 
anyone got a link for the liverpool game
the state of fulham , literally couldn't give a fuck . i'm not complaining tbh !
to be honest i can't liverpool mostly because suarez and skrtel .
every fulham player should be fined !
fulham are shocking ..
liverpool bouncing back spectacularly
we are silencing critics , we are in the title race , liverpool here we keep going , 4 nil against fulham
liverpool winning . i'm really not surprised .
suarez again . liverpool excellent . fulham crap ! 
i feel sorry for all 17 fulham fans who've made the journey to anfield this afternoon . jol won't be at the christmas party at this rate !
liverpool won't be in the top 4 come may , thank me later
can we play fulham every week
bent and tarrabt on the bench ? berbatov up top on his own ? jol doesn't do himself any favours 
liverpool get sump fi beat up todeh
and to think we didn't score against arsenal . 4-0 liverpool 👏
liverpool dominating
loving this liverpool dominance , but isn't this elder abuse ? 
i fucking love liverpool in games like this ! haha !
the thing is we play this bad every week , but liverpool are good enough to knock this many past us
goalll !!!! suarez again !!! 4-0 fulham
liverpool fans enjoy it while it lasts
liverpool is looking scary . hahahaha
can’t way to watch liverpool’s highlights after the georgia game . sounds like gerrard’s been in top form .
fuck liverpool !
cute liverpool couldn't do this last week
back home . no suprise tbf fulham are piss poor !
this is definitely martins jol last game in charge of fulham
fulham are just a boring pointless useless team . just get relegated already you've outstayed your welcome .
jesus !!! liverpool 4-0 up ... you know who ... suarez again with his brace ..
this liverpool match don taya me already , 2mao show quick jare make i watch football made in oziland
fulham are a bit useless . this could have been 10 already .
loving this from liverpool , fantastic way to respond from our loss to arsenal . been fantastic , fulham been awful 
according to cbs sports liverpool are playing 6-2-2 ... it's obviously working 
its liverpool day
liverpool are playing some really good football
fuck this season can be liverpool , arsenal or chelsea !
what the ? awat fulham ni chicken sangat ?
never seen a worse team , sorry fulham !
fulham have got to be the worst team in the league . even worse than palace .
 ... 54th minute ... liverpool 4 fulham 0 ...
so ppl wr sayin arsenal haven't met a top sided team ? a pity ryt
fulham are so poor this season .
fulham looking good . 4-nil and counting . ouch .
liverpool yes ♥
liverpool ruined my treble by being too good . had them down to win 3-0 .
liverpool best cf in the premier right now 
luis suarez ! again and again ! liverpool 4 - 0 fulham . 
4-0 to liverpool and counting , such a genius suarez is .
really hope fulham go down this season there a joke away from home .
watching liverpool , they are some team
4-0 fulham didn't show up but suarez did !
ohhh liverpool you've made my day ! 4-0 ! let's get a few more lads ! 😁 
granted fulham look terrible , but the last few years these are the kind of games liverpool would screw up . progress . 
i bet those united fans that laughed at my 6-0 liverpool prediction , feeling a bit clownish now :)
love to see fulham go down
this is what i mean liverpool banging them in 4 nil up
i'm finally watching a liverpool game and it is fucking spectacular 
fulham will come back don't you worry haha .
liverpool is killing fullham
what man utd did to fulham can be forgotten becos liverpool is tearing them apart
liverpool 4 - 0 fulham . and with that , number seven joins top scorers sturridge and agüero with 8 league goals each . 
fulham are making this match look easy ..
jol if khan don't sack you within 2 mins of the final whistle do the decent thing a walk . you can't be enjoying this . 
i've just found the best sandwich place in liverpool . am so happy right now 
i'll be surprised if martin jol is still in a job tomorrow morning . 
well my 3-0 prediction for lfc is out the window so now might as well go on and hang as many on fulham as possible ?
and united could only put 3 past fulham ....
gerrard has been fantastic for liverpool . instrumental and commanding in midfield .
goal : liverpool 4 - 0 fulham . suárez curls home for his second of the game . 
fulham may as well take an early relegation
fulham are embarrassing almost feel sorry for them
not a criticism - as can't do it , but liverpool do hammer shit sides . this will end up 6 or 7
liverpool scoring 4 today and failing to score last week means that we as in arsenal have a very very strong defence .
blatant dive in the box from fulham . i guess they have to try * something * to get back in it . thankfully the ref is not impressed . 
i'm chuffed liverpool are running riot , but i'm a bit gutted that this result will inevitably lead to martin jol getting the tin-tack .
just got home and i see lfc are crushing fulham . come on , you reds !!
goodjob liverpool 
as much as i hate liverpool they are a great team to watch
not looking forward to the prospect of playing liverpool . there's sort of premier league and the premier premier league now .
in other news , liverpool won't stop scoring . 
liverpool is the greatest team ever , nuff said
maybe jol should coach the jaguars and bradley manage fulham . 
super brilliant liverpool come on guys ,, six of the best won't be that bad 
is it not time fulham were relegated . championship team at best .
wahey get in liverpool
can't sleep but it's good , liverpool leading 4-0 in 56 minutes 😊
suarez again . liverpool excellent . fulham crap ! 
told my man at work to back liverpool -3 and he only did -1 ! i swear down im a tipster
mum turned on the tv and i saw ............ liverpool 4 - 0 fulham woooo !!! 
if aston villa don't win i'm going to start supporting liverpool
we love you liverpool we do , we love you liverpool we do , we love you liverpool we do , oh liverpool we love you
only a matter of time before jol is sacked . losing at anfield is fine but 4-0 so far with potential for more , fulham are better than that !
what kind of team is fulham ? oh god !
nice to see liverpool doing what they should be doing v poor opposition . loving the 28/1 pre season ..
suarez again !!! and gerrard assists again ! 4-0 liverpool lead .
 are so weak , no wander thrushed them . now are having a party .!!
if we played fulham it would be 0-0 right now .. liverpool tear these minnows apart . we should take note
can't blame jol for taking kacaniclic off , he loves liverpool !
4-0 to now and an absolutely shocking display from . playing like this , surely they can't stay in the premier league ?
liverpool are winning 4/0 and am still on edge 😳
fulham look like san marino out there
liverpool doing the goal difference a world of good . 4-0 is a great scoreline and they can add even more .
are liverpool going 2nd on goal difference then ?
such entertaining football from liverpool
i do get the feeling that maarten jol is better than this fulham team are showing ...
don't get me wrong liverpool are playing well but this is absolutely shite by fulham
liverpool -3
tea , bets and liverpool winning 
not surprised by the fulham score line at all
i know it's only fulham , but liverpool are playing brilliantly
fulham are playing like ........ well , fulham !

dah 4-0 dah .. come on liverpool
ohh liverpool dah 4 .
liverpool v fulham 3-0 common liverpool .... johnson , henderson & gerrard all brilliant in first half and goals from skrtel and suarez !
martin jol is getting sacked 100% at full time . have been so poor this year . a good coach just not working ! 
fulham havent turned up at all , need sturridge or coutinho goals now , just because
i reckon i tweet more about liverpool when we're losing to vent my frustration
i think liverpool can win 7-0
did fulham turn up today ? 😏
4-0 liverpool , and suarez is on fire .
not looking forward to us playing liverpool , we're going to be in a fair bit of trouble .
played fulham , gunna be a long afternoon for the boys
will fulham get relegated ..?
mike myers is in liverpool ? might just have to stalk him an kidnap him
finished work early and liverpool are winning ? purrrrfect 🙌
goalll ! 4-0
hate to say it but if suarez keeps up this form , you have to say liverpool look in contention for top four ... hopefully not at our expense .
it's alright turning up against fulham at home and it being happy days but being wank against arsenal
no of my bets are even close to being in yet , at least liverpool are dominating :)
omg stop scoring liverpool ! unless it's sturridge
if suarez is this good at liverpool i cant wait til january to see him at arsenal
hopefully fulham lose 8-0 , meaning they're worse than norwich . ( 7-0 probably worse as man city > liverpool )
is that how liverpool going on though
fulham and martin jol should pls be relegated asap .
omy back to watch liverpool 
every liverpool goal is only softened by the fact suarez is scoring them .
wish we could play fulham every week
55 mins gone . this time southampton conceded a goal 3-1 , but liverpool still scoring 4-0 .. 
disgraceful by fulham
jol has got to go , fulham are a shambles ... and i don't think he even cares 
it could be worse , we could be fulham fans 
liverpool rampant .
cmon folks nephews mum trying to convert him to a liverpool fanthis has got to stop hes a canary all the way 
liverpool i love you so much .. the pain of being at the emirates last week :( was hard to bear but i'm glad i'm seeing you back to your best !
ring a taxi for fulham we aint playing around today
real nd liverpool aint smiling @ all
liverpool forever at any situation .
embarassment for fulham lol . jol has to be sacked tonight
for fuck sake , every single fucking week liverpool fuck up my accumulator !!
from liverpool in champ 3 south derby 7 cambridge 7
the talent gap between these two sides is really ridiculous . shows both how much better liverpool is this year + how poor fulham's become .
fulham are piss poor . martin jol soon to get the sack ...
so united beat this mediocre fulham team last weekend and claimed they're back . how desperate can they get ?
thanks liverpool , you did well tonight !
nice one 
big win for liverpool tonite 
that half time tip for the liverpool game is looking very good now though ! 
l'pool 4 , fulham 0 . suarez with his 2nd goal . the cottagers doing their ' dying swan ' act once again

surely suarez can't stay at liverpool , he's way to good !
golll !! 54 ' luis suarez liverpool 4 - 0 fulham 
at least the liverpool score line has cheered me up , made up with that , icing on the cake if the blue shite get beat
bryan ruiz has been less than impressive for fulham
liverpool playing damn good
wtf liverpool 4-0 up omg
truth be told , fulham are really kak .
fuck off liverpool go back to being shit !!
fulham , you wouldn't know what to do with a penalty if you were given one at this stage
i bet suarez won't be liverpool player in january
suarez is really taking a big " bite " out of fulham ! he looks like he's been starvin for ages 
lol what is fulham's defense doing 
fulham have absolutely nothing about them
answer ! man united beat fulham 3-0 at home on ... 22nd mar 2003 ... while gareth gates and the kumars reached #1 with " spirit in the sky "
liverpool looking realllll good 
no wonder united dominated fulham last week . they are pony .
i swear liverpool is back 😍😍😍😍
answer ! fulham beat darlington 6-0 at home on ... 11th jan 1997 ... while spice girls reached #1 with " 2 become 1 "
seems fulham’s become reds usual victim , gd effort by henderson , smart mind pass by gerrard & quality finish suarez w another hattrick ynwa
el pistolero did it again ! 4 liverpool !
4-0 liverpool fullham !!
answer ! liverpool beat arsenal 3-0 at home on ... 7th apr 1979 ... while gloria gaynor reached #1 with " i will survive "

fulham are getting abused
really pity fulham .
fuck sake fulham .. they're destroying us😁 
suarez maybe a c*nt as a person but he is an amazing player and brilliant goalscorer . to be honest , liverpool do not deserve him .
luis suarez better than torres we bought from ajax to liverpool
now liverpool just should concede one to downgrade these fuckers . pouring libation to fitgods
now watching : liverpool vs fulham .
marcello trotta scores for brentford , at least one fulham player scored !
liverpool goleando :o
three of the goals assisted by gerrard . fulham defence had been very poor especially amorebieta and richardson .
i can see fulham being relegated this season . we are shit
when liverpool play like this it makes me think nothing else in the world even matters anymore
liverpool please please keep hold of suarez .
liverpool are toying with fulham
martin jol surely doesnt have long left now at fulham ?
suarez is just far too good a player for liverpool
i still want suarez to leave cause liverpool are more fluid without him
suarez tried one from the half way line and it was a decent effort ! that's how poor fulham are right now . 
1613 : goal - southampton 3-1 hull - yannick sagbo ( 55 mins ) 1611 : goal - liverpool 4-0 fulham - luis suarez
luis suárez now has eight goals and one assist in his last four premier league with liverpool . 
sigh , does liverpool wanna kill fulham !?
tyranosuarez !! liverpool 4-0 fulham 
 gave £4m and now jol is crap manager ! fulham's board needs to have reality check . players aren't good enough
nightmare for fulham ... supersuarez on fire !!! party still on ! 4-0 on 57 ' 
liverpool are shit are they ? tell the fulham fans that ;)
gerrard assists again . suarez scores his 2nd and makes it 4 ! liverpool 4-0 fulham
amorebieta is having a nightmare , but he's still better than fulham's midfield .
liverpool are up there with arsenal this season . hate saying this but truth hurts
liverpool ona mad one una🙌
liverpool-playing like a pack of hyenas ! 
never seen liverpool play such artistic football
fulham getting abused !!!! 
liverpool is on fire . 🔥
wowsers 
fulham good for bout 7 today .
whoever said liverpool would beat fulham 5-0 hope you placed a bet on that scoreline .
fulham on the other hand are so boring i hope they get relegated
last 2 week fulham have just accepted that we will lose . no fight what so ever . poor 
save to say liverpool is too good . i mean who wouldn't be scared at a goal scoring machine vampire and a rather fast black man at the front ?
fulham are such a good team
i luv liverpool
somebody asked me this week who is my favourite team to watch . at home to poor opposition there is nobody better than liverpool with suarez
jordan henderson is an impressive lad . i think he'll be big for liverpool . 
liverpool are on fire atm !
i've actually walked away from watching fulham . can't take this .
somewhere in fulham , a man types " we'd like to thank martin for his hard work and wish him luck in the future ".

fulham are the worst football team i've seen in a long , long time and i remember that i went to a blackburn rovers game a few weeks back .
collymore : ' berbatov has stunk out fulham like a barrel of rotten ... um ..... tuna .'
" fulham being caught on the ball too often " henderson
fulham with such a highline , i reckon jol wants the sack .
liverpool will win easily

on this day , in 2004 , liverpool signed 2 veryime to take those dreams for the rush of passion's fire , - survivor ,
fulham are devastatingly bad at the moment as well , doesn't look like anyone in their team wants it
' fulham are poor ' must be our new name . the commentators always say it .
talking bout fulham , where are they in the league ranking 
jordan henderson has absolutely bossed it against fulham so far . about time he got some recognition , has a good season so far 
hulls pulls one back to reduce the damage . better than purpose-less fulham .

fulham have been so so so so poor today .
chelsea playing well , liverpool having fun
we made liverpool look shitty last week . that's how good we are . 
liverpool ain't messing about , serious title contenders definitely finishing top 4 looking forward to see them in the cl next season
i think suarez is unhappy at liverpool
4nil liverpool suarez with the hatrick , fulham season looking awful with every game
i will hate liverpool till the death of me but boy have they capitalized on united's failures this season .
want to see liverpool get 7 to put out a message like man city did 
real madrid 4-0 fulham . 
every radio station are now laughing at us . and rightly so . this is a disgrace . get that mug out now 
wtf liverpool scored 4 amd mac is showing the fucking chelsea match
why has fulham had the ball for 30 seconds ?
liverpool is leading . so is exo . sometimes two worlds colliding can be beautiful exo
thanks liverpool for winners to day .
no one can stop liverpool once they are on form
the players in this fulham squad don't have any passion
 liverpool
liverpool doing well cum on suarez get the 3rd , ynwa 😝😝😝😝
how shit are fulham .
yeah umm ... suarez just going off ... liverpool is on another level that fulham cant even see
anyone would think i'm a liverpool expert
just keep a clean sheet liverpool . that's all i ask .
liverpool is vexing gan oh ..
liverpool with 4 goals !
this liverpool game is the most one-sided game i've seen in a long time . fulham players should be embarassed
suarez is too good for liverpool . but not good enough to get past per and kos .
i'm loving the liverpool kit with the poppy on it 
my bet chelsea , liverpool , blackpool , southampton , sheff united , burnley , stevanage , st johnstone : g
fulham's midfield is filled with a bunch of jokers lol
fulham are the pits . relegate them now .
liverpool 4-0
this fulham's defence doe - porous ..: d
gerrard has been great today . lively and more energetic 
liverpool fan or not the way this team is playing right now is impressive 
lucas has made so many tackles it's actually a little unfair on fulham
if he stays fit and well fed , liverpool will challenge
or maybe fulham just blast
liverpool just stop it😂👌
fulham dreadful , jol to get the boot ?
panen poin liverpool malam ini ;)) 
if fulham are not careful , they'll get relegated this season . martin jol could just be the next manager to get sacked soon .
goal !!! liverpool 4-0 fulham ( 54 mins) . luis suarez 
damm liverpool is on a roll
am tempted to go for football trials at fulham , they are in need of some decent defenders
liverpool
fulham are shocking 😂
i think a few of the managers palace had lines up have been waiting for the fulham job . their patience will soon pay methinks .
fuck me liverpool are on fire today
i come back upstairs only to see liverpool are beating fulham 4-0 hahaha
i love liverpool
mad props to the liverpool management for keeping suarez - controversial as hell , but , my god , can he play 
oh fulham 🙈
liverpool will still get 5th
rogers goes back to 2 centre backs , liverpool running riot !! 
so fulham is this bad
so gutted about rovers but so happy about liverpool !
corner for fulham . mignolet necks the end of his bovril . time to concentrate . 4-0 .
time to get your coat 
premier league liverpool 4-0 fulham last goal : suarez time : 55 via : sorry girls , but barca and real is first -sm
... suarez rattles fulham's defence and got a brace as at 56th min .
liverpool are shit , they get over excited about beating teams they should beat , but then get shut down by better teams
mr liverpool runnin the show
liverpool have fuckin smashed fulham can't wait for the derby on the 23rd
liverpool <3
no idea why i never lumped on liverpool at + 2.5 goals and suarez to score anytime . the odds were evens . printing money
loving the way liverpool is playing currently . if only they could have played like this last week lol 
would love to see fulham relegated !
fulham can't keep up the tempo .. good tempo with a good rhythm ..
you would expect the players at fulham to at least try . poor atmosphere round the whole club atm
fulham has no team chemistry . same thing happened last week against manchester united .
liverpool 3-0
corner for fulham . 58 ' played . 4-0
manutd fans think they did something great when they beat this fulham last week ... dead team
had fulham to draw . not sure why i even bet
half time liverpool 3 fulham 0
fulham are jarg but we're playing brilliantly . pressure we're putting on the ball is unbelievable .
feel for fulham supporters who travelled today , i'm not spending another penny on away games until jol is removed
berbatov loves playn for fulham 
haven't seen liverpool played so well before
lucas completed 100% of his 45 passes in the first half with 53% going forwards 
now , if this was q boxin match , the ref could gave stop this match to put fulham out of they miseries . outplayed
we will spell fulham and quote it
see ya were dreadful against us last week . not much better today judging by twitter ! who's the next manager ?
how are fulham doing this ?! they've got so many good players at their disposal ...
fast game from liverpool .
liverpool so comfortable . this is a complete rout 
thats twice in as many home fixtures against fulham , liverpool find themselves boasting a 4-0 scoreline . 
i literally feel so bad for fulham right now ....
power ahh liverpool . good job suarez . dah 4-0
liverpool 4-0 -_-
at this rate , liverpool will make up for their goal difference , but not the point . 
liverpool is at its strongest in anfield
fulham might as well be relegated now the way they are trying to play 
liverpool is playing their best game .
must be awkward being a fulham fan ...
4 for liverpool ok happy for you
liverpool give chance pls
 amazing game awesome player
martin jol sacked in about an hour p45 ready . 
with coutinho back , liverpool is getting stronger :d
luis suarez scored hat-trick until now v fulham ! in we trust :'(
i should not watch more matches so liverpool will win more .
i remember when fulham lost 10-0 at anfield . in the league cup back in the 1980's . could happen again today . jol out . 
liverpool 
liverpool are absoulty ballin playing some serious stuff a joy to watch and a joy to be a pool fan 
get your money on jol to be sacked after this performance 
fulham just can't handle suarez .
now why couldn't liverpool do that at woolwich ; (
liverpool are walking this 
too much mistake in one game . 
liverpool
liverpool gile babi ah .. 4-0
i remember that khan fella all pro-fulham before our game with them . what now for him ? focus on series3 of his bbc1 sitcom ? 
this liverpool game is just too fun .
why isnt liverpool onnnnn ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i bet jamie is sobbing into his fulham bed sheets 
this fulham seif .. just give liverpool bonus !!
liverpool right now👌
liverpool are good , until they play top teams

liverpool ... liverpool !! agiyah taruy ..... 
fuk u suarez ! fuk u liverpool !
 : liverpool 4-0 fulham ( 54 mins) . luis suarez gets his second of the match , latching on to steven gerrard's pass before slotting in
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 liverpool c'mon lads just take it easy
13 goals conceded in last 4 games 
liverpool are just glad they've played arsenal already lol
bad thing about today is jol will be sacked , pity seems a nice bloke 
 is on a mission today but don't forget he hates lol
simply fantastic ! this is the liverpool way ! bright future ! ynwa ! 
comepn liverpool
suarez is good . liverpool don't deserve him .
by far one of liverpool's best games so far this season . 
fulham definitely needs to be relegated
liverpool <3
everybody seems to be writing liverpool off for the league title this season
fulham and the piggy bank
wouldn't be surprised if fulham end up managerless tonight , they're terrible !
 ! come on liverpool ! come on real !
scott parker has really transformed this fulham side 
liverpool .
saying that liverpool have been excellent aswell !
liverpool 25 shots so far . fulham 2 shots . mignolet may aswell get his kindle out and have a lie down
at least one fulham has scored . trotta .
love playing rugby in liverpool 👊👊
liverpool score a 4th goal against fulham , suarez scoring 
fulham better wear protection now . a raping session is going to take place .
if liverpool continue playing like this at this rate , i dont see why we cant finish in the top 4 .
liverpool in killer mood
fulham are so bad ... i think moyes should consider buying their team 
kinda funny liverpool will only be 2 points behind us but the actual gap between the sides is absolutely huge
wohoooo liverpool 4goals ! 
liverpool are tearing fulham apart fair play👌
does liverpool have a new manager or something ?
who even supports liverpool 
i said liverpool wouldn't be disheartened by the arsenal defeat . they just got beat by one of the most in-form team in europe
as a liverpool fan i still 
captained suarez instead of aguero and benched boruc for mignolet . liverpool don't concede pleeeease ... 
4-0 ?!?!? you serious ?! omggg liverpool lots of love for you ♡♥♡♥
dempsey could only help fulham right now , right ? right ?
i want bout 7 hey liverpool
american woman confused liverpool and liverpool st at station ! 
wha da liverpool score ?
liverpool hmmmm :)
liverpool is killing it ! suarezzz <3 hoping for a hatrick !!
liverpool's biggest win over fulham at anfield is 7-0 in 1955 . that's under threat today the way this game is going ... 
madrid gana 4x0 frente al real sociedad , liverpool gana 4x0 frente al fullham , pierde dortmund 2-1 , gana chelsea 1-0 frente west brom .
liverpool have just been dismantling these lower teams this season . but the real test are the top 6/7 teams .
more liverpool !! 
but liverpool have looked bright
liverpool be playin lik boss nw , they couldn't try dis @ emirates !! ☺
you know what's pissing me off most about the fulham game ... i changed my captain to aguero from suarez 
jordan henderson and luis suarez both created 4 chances in the first half with henderson getting an assist 
thats 4-0 ... way to easy for us today ... come on liverpool :d 
oo when the reds go marching in , o liverpool so wonderfoul \m/
liverpool boss brendan rodgers is after two january signings , with greek forward konstantinos mitroglou on the radar . ( source : daily mirror )
unbelievable i spent 5 hours of my life in brewerkz drinking straight beer watching liverpool beat the hello out of ful on the greens
fulham jaguars in desperate need of a bye week as they look to slump to a 3-7 record . head coach jol + defensive coordinator under pressure .
fulham are going down this year .
whatever the score is , dimitar berbatov will never try hard . that arrogant , lone wolf mentality is a detriment to fulham . 
half time and its already liverpool 4 fulham 0 ! lets hope it ends in double figures !
wonderful liverpool ,
was watching the liverpool game hoping theyd lose . after they scored the third goal i changed to chelsea hoping they lose
fulham are shocking
i'd like to say this is because we're boss but it's mainly just fulham being turbo shite
liverpool need to stop now 6
goal hull ! goal suarez ! get the hat ! 
missed the aussies big win and now liverpool dominating to study ... dammit exam !
tuning in to this liverpool match
liverpool 4
suarez is an arsenal player trapped in the body of a liverpool player
suarez just attempted to score from the halfway line ... 57 ' liverpool 4 fulham 0 -lam
liverpool should have played with an empty net . i bet fulham would fail to score still . .
will be watching later but .... have been that good or have fulham been really shit ??
liverpool making fulham look like sh*t ....
tell you what . if everton plays like this against liverpool .....
 liverpool is gonna win no doubt !!
united beat fulham 3-1 .. finding form .. same fulham is being trashed by liverpool 4 nil . man utd get ready to be dealt with tomorrow .
nvm i should watch liverpool back☺️ go liverpool☺️
liverpool are so bored now they've resorted to shooting from the halfway line ( suarez , obviously) .
gerrard was criticised last week for dip in performances . guess how he's answered them : 3 assists for all 3 liverpool goals . 
nvm .. wat cool .. watlek~
the last fulham game i watched ended with a maxi hattrick . same today for suarez ?
beaut liverpool performance so far .. laterz fulham
this fulham players loose concentration easily all of them deserve a big hairdryer treatment that's if there is any
liverpool on the othe hand doing gud 4-0
martin jol won't be in charge for fulham's next game
liverpool is on fireee !
harap2 fans liverpool enjoy season ni sebab next season suarez g madrid
fulham need to just allow it . they are hurting my eyes
if liverpool could scored like this in every match ( y )
fulham are shocking
still dont understand y liverpool wud ve a striker like suarez . dude is classic .
in all honesty the liverpool result isn't impressive unless we put at least 6 past them . fulham are abysmal at the moment .
liverpool went rampage
i'm always losing a follower when i go crazy during the liverpool game ... smh
liverpool !!!!
fulham need to keep clean sheets so we play senderos and we need to score goals so we play berba .... i dont get it
:) i love liverpool ...
fulham are shocking how are they a 4 and a half star team on fifa
did somebody say liverpool 
ok great 30mins to watch liverpool play . so far theyre doing awesome .

well done liverpool 🙌
wouldn't surprise me if they sacked martin jol right in the middle of this match 
channels here are showing chelshit match , could've shown liverpool game so that i could atleast see some class players like suarez & gerrard
i think if liverpool don't finish top 2 this season they'll lose suarez . world class striker , best in the league at the minute .
proper gonna do my head in how i dont know who was shouting my name in liverpool before
suarez can be liverpool's bale this season
suarez has scored more goals than fulham this season
i don't normally advocate the sacking of managers , and i actually rate martin jol . however fulham definitely need something to change .
wearing my liverpool jersey .
and how on earth can anyone get spanked by liverpool is beyond me . that team is utterly tragic . we demolished them last week with ease
fuck me this fulham team are poor . went in the complete opposite direction once hodgson left them
 fans don't get carried away this is fulham .
liverpool are playing great team-work football , great to watch
fulham are awful this year
liverpool is on fire today ! 👍
liverpool 4-0 fulham . suarez curls home for his second of the game . i told you he's started to score when he got his first . 
fulham is the beating stick for epl
see enough liverpool fans breaking out this year cuz they doing decent ukno lol
i don't get , isn't it the same liverpool that we destroyed ?
want to keep the clean sheet . fulham haven't come close to deserving a goal ... they are awful . 
it must be done soon , so that players with youth , pace , energy and desire can be brought in . fulham are turning into last season's qpr
rt thosescouselads : mike myres is a liverpool fan hahaha , yesss
fulham should start thinking of how they'll come back to the premiere league next 2 seasons cause relegation is all i see for them
love how well liverpool have been playing recently 👌👌👌
the ads during the liverpool match on setanta ireland are so cringe 😖😖
liverpool 4-0 fulham ( 54 mins) . luis suarez gets his second of the match , latching on to steven gerrard's pass before slotting in

fulham's starting 11 is actually not bad . they have a lot of good players . it's sad to see they are playing this way
brendan rogers is so annoying and talks too much but i can't deny he's done a great job at liverpool . he's the right man for them , imo .

so gerrard has a hat trick of assists today but yet he's past his best ??? no delusional liverpool fans , how can you criticize this guy ?!!!
fulham really need to flush some player out ...... #
expect motd to say this liverpool performance against fulham is proof that they can win the league . meanwhile , arsenal yet to be tested .
liverpool scoring for fun , making scoring looks increasingly difficult .. we are shit , manager makes no difference ..
liverpool winning 4-0 yup
liverpool didn't have to sign cissokho after all . he's not made the cut in the premiership .
liverpool !!!! suarez !!!!! gerrard !!!! need i say more ??? 
with enrique in , now this is the strongest liverpool squad !
i'm editing the liverpool game - i'll put a ' 0 ' in the fulham score box now - save me time later on
on fire , shanklys boys :') 
another gutless showing from fulham how long can it go on until jol fucks off . rather have sanchez back and that's shocking . 
liverpool
liverpool look impressive today , what happened last sat ?
liverpool on fireee ... suarez is just amazing . henderson and johnson bossing the game . hendo what a pass for suarez .
suarez second goal does in fact make it 4-0 liverpool .
done 6-0 liverpool and 4-2 southampton not looking bad
if suarez started the season liverpool would be top no dout
but remember that tim calum was a liverpool fan
not so long ago fulham were in the europa league final , now there are relegation candidates . shows how far they have fallen 
oh dear , suarez scores again . his 2nd of the match & 8th of the season . liverpool 4-0 fulham 
3 more goals please liverpool .
i think the fulham team need to pay for a ticket for this match becoz they are just watching us play ball .
liverpool winning , chelsea drawing . good times .
i think fulham were in liverpool's half for nearly a full minute there
wooo liverpool's main defenders are back . johnson skrtel agger enrique .
enrique in , best liverpool xi for me this season
54 - this is the 54th time liverpool have scored 4+ goals in a pl home game , only man utd ( 74) , chelsea ( 63 ) & arsenal ( 62 ) have more . spree

liverpool are smashing shit up , serious . i definitely think they may have it this year !!
liverpool have not conceded a goal while cissokho has played for them . only positive thing you could say about him .

liverpool playin like dem hungry tu score more
63´ 0-0 60´ 1-1 49´ 0-0 63´ 4-0 64´ 3-1 
can see fulham going down this year if they don't bring in a new manager . they just look like an easy 3 points for 15/16 clubs in the league
if fulham were winning this they'd be on about how berbatov is so effortless .. make up your mind nobheads
woww luis suarez has come back in devastating form after his 10 match ban as he scores his 2nd against fulham , 8 goals in just 5 games .
a great way to get over a disappointing defeat last week - go out and smash fulham at home ! 
chelsea 1 - westbrom 1 wapi mafans wa arsenal , man-u , liverpool , man city , jameni ,,, hit " like " ( y ) for another goal for wba ... :p

liverpool is making fulham look like poor losers ............ 
last week man utd 3-0 up , win 3-1 , many city 3-0 up , win 7-0 . this week soton 3-0 up now 3-1 . will liverpool go on to score 7 ? 
liverpool don't worry me , those ones home and away we got them beat , chelsea are the ones who should drop points
cleaning up on this liverpool game , sturridge goal or two needed along with an inter win later on for a cracker of a day !! 👍
i predicted liverpool to win 3-0 so i wasn't too far off but ugh
yes ya beauty ! cone on west brom , come on liverpool !

dya reck its to early to chalk liverpool as a win on the coupon ??
don't want to see it but think at 4-0 down , this could be martin jol's last game in charge of fulham

i think liverpool should buy midfielders ah .

suarez with two goals for liverpool , he's been amazing this season , hasn't he .. ( apart from afc match ) 
not much hope but need a fulham goal .

a suarez hattrick and a chelsea loss , what . better can a liverpool fan ask for ?............ or not .
the most annoying thing about liverpool doing well is suarez is scoring for them . 
update score : la liga madrid 4 vs 1 sociedad ,.. epl chelsea 1 vs 0 wba , liverpool 3 vs 0 fulham
liverpool
absolute tragedy that will hughes is a massive liverpool fan . he'll end up there and he'll be unbelievable 
the only decent player for fulham today has been steklenburg and he has conceded 4 ! 
i'm a happy liverpool fc supporter . ^_^
enjoying a few nice pre-gig in liverpool
liverpool's counter attacking is so dangerous especially with countinho leading the counter attack
was going to put chelsea , liverpool , southampton and bolton on a btts & win coupon but couldn't be arsed going to the bookies .
liverpool ❤
the fact liverpool are not playing in europe is just sad , sigh
liverpool vs what team until 4-0 ? man united eh ? : 3
how did stekelenburg end up at fulham ? like no offense to them , but surely he deserves a better back line infront of him ? not a bad keeper
liverpool are in fire this year

if suarez can keep this up liverpool should walk into the top 4 this season
liverpool is the fuckin team man

liverpool are kicking shit out of fulham today
how on earth can be captain ... man of immense skill but a heart of a mouse !!! 
all fulham fans blaming jol . the main problem is , is that their team is absolute dog shit
not everyone is a fan of liverpool but everyone is a fan of gerrard 
yes liverpool 
liverpool give gerrard an early bath and bring on joe allen . 
massive game for the swans away to fulham in 2 weeks time .
ive done suarez first goal and liverpool to win 4-0 .. was it his goal or wa ?
liverpool demolishing fulham magical suarez
liverpool 4-0 up vs fulham , does that mean we're back to the myth that suarez and sturridge are the best strike force in the league again ?

we could flanagan in goal and fulham still wouldn't score
liverpool playing very well tonight
berbatov looks like he has given up on fulham
this is the 54th time liverpool have scored 4+ goals in a pl home game , only man utd ( 74) , chelsea ( 63 ) & arsenal ( 62 ) have more . spree
liverpool need to keep pressing . can't get into the habit of slowing down in the second half no matter what the score is
i would like liverpool to finish above united this season but i'd also love to sign suarez if they dont make cl 22
forza liverpool !!!
fulham are rubbish , jol must go
liverpool's great !!
i really hate that liverpool are good and same with arsenal . but i do respect arsenals play . 
liverpool are going in
liverpool aren't gonna score anymore . joe allen is coming on ....
suarez definitely worth that £50m liverpool wanted in summer ..
liverpool is awesome tonight
fulham have had a shot at goal ! now allen coming on for gerrard who gets a standing ovation . don't know why , he didn't score . sheesh . 4-0 .
suarez though ... he's miles ahead of liverpool ...
enjoying liverpool's game . but i am still with manchester united . loyal bro .
yay ! hope joe allen in liverpool's ramsey . :p
really wanna go to central perk in liverpool !!
would really appreciate just 1 fulham goal ! 🙏

good to see joe allen get a run out , hopefully he can prove he still has something to contribute to this liverpool side 
amorebieta is not sure he is fulham or liverpool player . 
fulham are spineless . i can see jol getting sacked in the morning . say goodbye to the suavest manager in the league 
good jobs liverpool 
another changing for liverpool , welcome back from injuries joe allen
liverpool play so well when they are pressuring . they have youth , energy and enthusiasm plus the experienced general gerrard 
i a royally forgot allen played for liverpool hahaha
liverpool : a club back in the game perchance ? fulham : a shambles . cart or horse ?
look out fulham . the mighty joe allen is on ....
you see why the liverpool boss wanted to find out what we are smoking at arsenal .
wait , wba have equalized against chelsea and i'm watching liverpool winning 4-0 ? fml .
looking good liverpool make up for last weeks shit game ...
i do find liverpool fans to be strangely defensive without reason on twitter ...
daniel agger . you can't bypass him fulham . he is the great wall of anfield !
liverpool sub gerrad for allen
i couldn't be more thrilled for the way things are going for liverpool right now .
liverpool are really really good . like really good . 
i just hope for 10-0 win for liverpool just to help with the mr jol sacking process ...
liverpool 👌 good recovery to the game last week
serious worries for fulham . shouldn't be giving any team this much reign on a match . letting us dictate .
substitution enrique coming on for cissokho for liverpool and hughes comes on for zverotic for fulham . liverpool 4 v fulham 0
liverpool . you'll never walk alone ❤ hahahaha
you know liverpool are taking the piss when they replace gerrard for allen hahaha !!!
i sure hope when chelsea plays fulham they can keep their sorry ass display of football up .....
don't mean to chuck a huge hodge pile on liverpool's parade .... but a clean sheet would be really nice
joe allen , liverpool just taking the piss outta fulham now
people saying " it's only fulham " but remember how many times have we fluffed our lines at home against the likes of these " only fulham's "
fulham's display has been punished by a merciless liverpool side . it seems martin jol has lost the dressing room . his team is crap
 is winning 4/0 ( still playing ) assisted the 4 goals !! what a u r steve .. i love u yakhii 
can fulham just call mercy and go home ?
great football from liverpool
joe allen still dey liverpool ni ?.. £15m boy
joe allen in steven gerrard our legend out 
nice subs to liverpool ...... remain victor moses to come up now

rodgers is just making a mockery of fulham by subbing joe allen on for gerrard
liverpool sub : gerrard for joe allen rt 
fantastic liverpool come on suarez lets make it another hatrick 4 0
isit me or is the majority of liverpool players wearing the same boots ? lol

well liverpool ... that was a belter ...
fulham are so shit , shouldve been relegated ages ago
c'mon liverpool
fulham are getting their tutey ripped apart .
a wee fulham goal would be grand ;) really cant see it happening though
in 1961 , the beatles ' future manager , brian epstein , first saw the group perform at the cavern club in liverpool , england .
how about this liverpool game ? am i right !? 
i think i'd rather have fulham go down than , say , sunderland . sunderland are equally awful ( if not more) , but at least they're trying .
come on you reds !!! liverpool
excited for some very much needed cocktails with the girls in liverpool tonight 🍸🎉
 !!!! :)) 
steven gerrard off joe allen in liverpool
65 min another sub for liverpool gerrard out , allen in
liverpool on beast mode !

england and fiji in a huddle together after a bruising encounter . can you see utd and liverpool doing that after a match ? 
now to make joe allen look like a superstar 
liverpool are their game tonight .
getting abuse about fulham from people who don't even follow football 
substitution alerts to liverpool !!! gerrard off - allen making his way in at the moment . liverpool 4-0 fulham , still the scoreline .
literallyyyyy breaks my heart seeing fulham like this ... jol is ruining the club
liverpool are washed ! why didn't you come this clinical last week ?
 .. sape minat ?
if you not a liverpool fan you can't help but to admit that luis suarez is a top striker !!
allen is on let the fulham come back begin
match of the day is going to be decent for liverpool fans tonight !
gerrard is replaced by allen . 3 assists for the liverpool captain today . 
liverpool should've had this starting line-up last weekend
i'm not a big soccer fan but liverpool holds a special place in my heart . i was attract to their looks first but dayuuum they have skillzxc .
liverpool got recruits though ... poldi , ox , theo , i've forgotten about diaby tbh
liverpool should slow down already
go liverpool ! suarez makes me shout like crazy !!! 😘😘😘😘😘
aw yeah , stevie gets a rest with 24 minutes to go . that's how shit fulham are .
reina ( napoli , on loan from liverpool ): " my future ? we'll see . my contract at liverpool resumes in june , but returning is difficult " [ marca ]
martin jol is on his last leg here and on his tip toes , fulham are muck
time for the liverpool match
ouhhhhh yes ! liverpool dah 4-0 !
the greatest midfielder ever to grace goes off , on
great performance by liverpool today gerrard has been fantastic
liverpool the best
while liverpul leads fulham by 4 nil .
 is the missing piece needed to cement their title challenge ! 
take a bow stevie though fulham are shiite 
liverpool are on fire today .
chelsea slipping again ... same thing i told united fans last week , liverpool fans don't get excited , everyone is beating fulham .
don't tell me what i should feel about fulham or west brom if they were hypothetically barca because that's just stupid
going to start watching chelsea now instead of liverpool , which inevitably means chelsea will win the game .
can't believe i'm missing the liverpool game
agger is liverpool leader now <3
liverpool , legend is back !
looking forward to watch liverpool on match of the day tonight 
fulham just have so many luxury players . upsetting that they can't work together . habing sidwell in your team can't help .
fulham making liverpool look good
and liverpool are cruising
this liverpool-fulham game is similar to the jax-tennessee finale last year .
liverpool's goal keeper is getting paid for standing 
damn liverpool went in on fulham ....... !!!
i missed liverpool's match again and again . biggest thanks goes to live tweet ... 😢😩😔
liverpool is on fire !
4 assists for 4 -0 : captain fantastic , take a bow ! . 
menit 66 " gerrad out allen in liverpool 4-0 :: guand ::
( 8 ) he's big , he's bad , he's steven gerrard ( 8 ) 
sounds as tho suarez is on fire as usual .. easily the best striker in the league and consistant ! 
lmao ... liverpool pouring their frustration on westbrom after a whooping 2-0 loss at emirates last weekend !!!
fulham is a misnomer , probably foolham would be more apt 
australia and liverpool all win good day of spor
very good performance so far by liverpool today :)
liverpool look almost too good today ... fulham must be awful .
gerrard was immense today . good to see allen get game time should boost confidence but fulham are so pedestrian not the biggest test
liverpool are destroying fulham
suarez hatrick , liverpool clean sheet and a ward-prowse assist will do me just fine 
 4-0 fulham , 4-0 real sociedad ( y )
yayyy liverpool !!! k goodnight . haha
joe allen and henderson cost liverpool £29m . aaron ramsey and arteta cost arsenal £ 14.3 m . 
liverpool 4-0 .... 4-0 
fulham's just getting bullied .
well done leader👍👍👍👍 
come on liverpool
this liverpool game is looking good ★♥ 
liverpool is definitely gonna be in top 4 ... i really hope man utd would also be among them .

you'll never walk alone ... go liverpool :-)
liverpool .... liverpool !
love liverpool right now ❤️❤️ 
liverpool is on fire . they are playing like they can beat anyone . exciting game to watch .
is it only me who thinks sacking jol after defeats to man utd & liverpool would be harsh ? they ain't expected to get anything from those .
your opinion don't matter .... liverpool is the best team in the world !!!!!!

wish i was watching the liverpool game
waiting for suarez hattrick - lfc 4 - 0 fulham -live
lol that was so close to being so dumb real madrid why can't you be more like liverpool -- whoa what just happened
fulham's and clint dempsey's quick descent into obscurity is pretty noticeable . he never should have left the club .
liverpool are just too comfortable right now .

liverpool's raping like ...
thank you bayern munich with your 94th minute penalty ! munich goals over 2.5 , and over 2.5 home goals for liverpool , leyton o and real madrid
it's a bit sad to watch fulham but on a happier note , enrique and allen are back from injury ! things are looking good for the future 
liverpool up by 4 and sturridge nowhere in the score sheet . i know he gotta be sick right now .
dortmund is on decline , liverpool go sign reus now . 
i put sturridge in my fantasy team , clearly i picked the wrong liverpool striker 
love a lazy saturday , winning and streaming the liverpool match 
steven gerrard has dictated this game today and well deserved rest and all since fulham have been shocking
liverpool fc is in the zone today ))
dahm liverpool is playing great football this season never knew that had it in them but united is still going to win the league
i thought jol would do a good at fulham
fulham getting annihilated . seems like a day suarez will grab an hat-trick ...
nice one liverpool . 
liverpool always killing it and playing sikk when i'm at work
" liverpool fans might be cheering on man utd tomorrow afternoon ." not if my fucking spleen depended on it .
liverpool had misse coutinho so much 
how can you not support liverpool ? top dollar team , us !
now my tl is full of liverpool fans celebrating the goalss ....
 players u are truley an embarrisment to your club and martín jol , he will lose his job and u wont give a fuck . berbatossa ! 
liverpool will be lauded as title challengers again after this . it's almost as though the pundits are mostly ex-players of theirs .
" luis suárez is aiming to become the first liverpool player since torres in march 2008 to score hat-tricks in successive home games ." 
liverpool wooow :)
we will shortly launch our business bootstrapping project with liverpool chamber to provide £1000 investment to new micro businesses

liverpool's defence is much better without kolo toure
fulham are so shit it's unbelievable
liverpool done nothing convincing imo . two setpiece goals , relying on suarez once again & thanks to a miserable dejected fulham team .

at the beginning of the season i thought chelsea or man city would win the league but now i reckon arsenal or liverpool have a shot !
liverpool nearly get there 5th
stekelenburg has been fulham's best player . and we've scored 4 . 
if liverpool were a woman , and fulham a man . i'd say this man is pretty disinterested in playing with this lady , despite her persistence .
said it before , but sometimes a club needs to change managers just to stop the players drifting . fulham are awful .
come on liverpool ... one or 2 more goals send a message .
 it was a joke , a liverpool fan told me he doesn't kif you did a resolution bracelet ! amazing ! love it ! xx
let's all laugh at chelski let's all laugh at fulham let's all laugh at chelski lets all laugh at fulham

cum on liverpool mo goales
listing every bad performance fulham have put in this season isn't possible on twitter . not enough characters . 
liverpool will finish 5th but suarez will get top scorer or something . trust me man
liverpool !!
liverpool is playing so well and they are showing everton :(
real madrid need to score two more to uphold their part of the bet as sociedad just pulled one back , liverpool only safe bet at the moment

been paying attention to romp against fulham . didn't even notice lolchelsea .
manchester to liverpool in 45 mins ? good effort .
great teamwork from suarez and coutinho down the right as they dribble at the fulham defence . coutinho then opts to shoot but it's wide .
expected much better from fulham this season
looks like liverpool doing well again

fulham are so pathetic that liverpool have given up on the idea of scoring anymore . for the sake of martin jol's job .
it really would have been madness for liverpool to sell us suraez ... arsenal should double down to get him this january
it's so open this year , arsenal and liverpool must not believe their luck !

liverpool is red hot chilli pepper 
fulham players are just so disappointing and annoying , gush !
liverpool !!... best part is !
54 - this is the 54th time liverpool have scored 4+ goals in a pl home game , only man utd ( 74) , chelsea ( 63 ) & arsenal ( 62 ) have more . spree
liverpool making me proud !! !!
amazed at leicesters ' ability to be selectivity poor . dominate fulham and then look weak against nottingham forest ...
liverpool play so good
fulham and chelsea both losing 
i am not speaking to liverpool supporters until further notice .

liverpool fan's will want man utd to win tomorrow dats a first 
liverpool is on fire
i'm not even exciting about liverpool winning 4-0 against fulham that's expected my mom can beat fulham
 it's not the size of the defeat which should worry fulham fans . it's the manner of the defeat . they've been abject .
liverpool winning , chelsea losing ! brilliant
4-0 get in liverpool ! 
liverpool running riot
to be fair , this is a piss poor fulham team . no confidence etc , but liverpool have played well . needed more goals though !
i love liverpool !
liverpool leading 4-0 .
liverpool 4-0 up but chelsea 2-1 behind which is not helping the bet . blackpool 1-1 fleetwood still a goal up and chester now 2-1 up
liverpool are looking good 👌
i really enjoyed watching liverpool .
liverpool performing every week is starting to worry me ... 
liverpool are doing great
fifa 14 difficulty levels : legendary , ultimate , world class , professional , semi-pro , amateur , fulham .
dad's wants to watch tennis and i want to watch liverpool 
feel a bit sorry for fulham's away fans , we've been good but almost none of their players have given a shit all afternoon tbh .
fulham's richardson be walking like wizkid's caro !!!
liverpool leading 4 - 0 to fulham
if chelsea do lose points today that just reiterates how important the win against liverpool was last week
only teams i backed that are winning is liverpool and southampton !
they way they've played today , fulham would finish bottom of the mls .
if berbatov isn't going to even try , why not at least give bent a run out ? 
more liverpool fans great :)
normally , nobody can stops me from missing a liverpool game . nobody .
4-0 liverpool decent 👌
liverpool winning 4-0 , brighton winning 2-0 what a day !!
liverpool on fire

the reds clearly appreciate the return of johnson , and the attacking options he provides ! 4 0 ! ynwa
 up liverpool
can't wait to watch the real madird and liverpool matches !! 
not walk alone 
liverpool should've even played this game without a goal keeper . mignolet hasn't broken a sweat koraa ..
👏👏👏liverpool
why is kieran richardson at fulham ? always thought he was a decent player
 tearing tonight ... 4-0 in 60mins .... many more to come . bad boy goin for the kill .
also federer for the win . liverpool tak payah cakap ahh .
do i watch liverpool try to get a fifth goal or should i watch chelsea loose ?? decisions decisions 
party tonight !! 
liverpool 4-0 up , and sturridge has neither scored nor assisted . this is because i put him as my fantasy football captain .
get home to find that liverpool are winning 4-0 ! awesome ! this should take us above chelsea again  
fulham just generally can't defend . 
but anyone could beat fulham so relax
after liverpool match . off to bed since waking up at 6 .
i thought jol would do a good job a fulham
if chelsea fuck us , there's 15 mins for the liverpool score to stay the same and we're well up ! 4sameresult
forget liverpool ... chelsea and man city are d threats to dat epl title 
looks like fulham fc are failing to walk through a storm and hold their head high 😆 
4-0 to liverpool and chelsea losing at home . would be nice for a suarez hattrick and for sturridge/coutinho to get a goal apiece 
these fulham niggas are collecting it up the ass . smh
can 5sos please come to manchester or liverpool please because that would be perfect
again . 
liverpool winning . arsenal/manu dropping points . perfect time to screw up .
73 minutes and 4 goals down to . safe to say fulham has been fully harmed .
all you fucking idiots that think liverpool would be better off without gerrard starting can fuck off you know nothing !!
i want chelsea to lose so liverpool will be second on the table
 b killing fulham lyk " its nothing "
arsenal and liverpool are only doing well because the real contenders are playing shit .
fuck chelsea & liverpool .
liverpool 4-0 sa rigole put !
amongst everything fulham that i own , all the memories i have , i think we are actually worse than the lawrie sanchez era . that's telling . 😞
i need fulham and wednesday to just score a fucking goal for fuck's sake !
good job liverpool . 
liverpool meng'lead' .. chelsea di'lead' ...
oh you do warm my heart . if only chelsea lose today and arsenal draw tomorrow

after missing liverpool's last epl match against arsenal due to ' whatever ', suarez i back bullying small kids .
great performance by liverpool today , although west brom also performing well ... chelsea 1 west brom 2 that will be my bet out the window !
how is utd away the proof of whether we can challenge properly ? what about : napoli ( h ) liverpool ( h ) sp*rs ( h ) dortmund ( a ) !!!

comon liverpool let's get a few more goals
aw my brother is so happy liverpool are winning
might put a lazy tenner on liverpool to win 7-0
pretty sure an actual ham would have put up more of a fight than fulham did today .
another suarez hat-trick on the cards ? fulham should just employ its damage limitation strategy now . 
from a liverpool fan's perspective , the problem with the league this season is that the shock results are being shared around 3 teams
what are the next three fixtures for liverpool and arsenal ?
liverpool looking good could this be the season !
noooo i should of put liverpool in the accumulator
27 goal attempts for liverpool . fulham only 4
come on west brom , hold on against chelsea now . do liverpool a favour !
play like this against liverpool we are fucked !!!

the score of this liverpool football club match is to my liking . 4-0 👍 
my prediction for this weekend : 1 . arsenal 2 . liverpool 3 . man city 4 . man utd 5 . chelsea
suarez has to leave liverpool if they dont make the top 4 this season
menit 75 sturidge out moses in lfc 4-0 fulham
go on west brom ! what a scalp if they can pull this off . liverpool dominating at fulham and only half an hour until the rugby . good day !
if results hold : epl table .... 1 ) arsenal 2 ) liverpool 3 ) southampton 4 ) chelsea 5 ) spurs
mind you i saw fulham were playing liverpool and thought they were gonna get beat by at least 3 goals , they do that to weak sides
the liverpool vs fullham match : * watched the first five minutes of the match * * went to do a math exercise * * got back * * score 3-0 * no comment
all i want from liverpool fc is a champions league spot and anywhere in the top 3 !
bravo liverpool !!! ynwa @ -> ---

hoping the liverpool game finishes like this .. suarez for last goalscorer 
come on liverpool . make it 5-0
goal liverpool 4-0 fulham ( 54 mins) . luis suarez gets his second of the match , latching on to steven gerrard's pass before slotting in
becoming a growing trend that liverpool rip the lower teams to pieces
no tifosi because holligand 
come in fulham .... get a draw pleeeeeease 🙏
glad to see liverpool and arsenal more competitive this season , won't win anything but makes it bit more enjoyable 
mike myers austin powers at liverpool v fulham : mike myers struck a familiar pose as he was introduced to the anfield crowd ahead of ...

the chelsea game was boring so i put the liverpool game on and then chelsea start getting beat typical
senderos , amorebieta combo hasn't worked this afternoon . fulham missing hangeland .
shite performance so far , liverpool are gonna win the league anyway so it doesn't matter 
fuckkk i want the liverpool jersey wehhhh ....
senderos and the whole fulham team have made errors today and we duely punished them
have to admit liverpool do look like contenders this year
fulham might just look back at this as the day their dreams of winning the 2013/14 title ended .
 2 more cards or a red card for fulham to make it a winner .
arsenal will lead still , only by 2 points over liverpool . everton can reach 3rd with a win ...
of we keep playing like this liverpool are going to fuck us up .
having a brill weekend avicii tickets booked and liverpool are winning couldnt ask for anything more 
liverpool dominating possession with 65%
thank god im not in liverpool or watching this shambles 
suarez is good . too good to be in liverpool .
hahaha let's laugh at chelsea . liverpool guys won't stop pretending . crystal palace should contain everton . up soton !
waiting on fulham to score for 150 big ones 
wba , beat chelsea and manu , but nothing against liverpool :)
if liverpool were to qualify for the champions league next season , surely luis suarez deserves a hefty slice of bonus . remarkable player .
oi chelsea is there any room for one more fan ? fulham do my fucking head in ! 
liverpool not looking bad ...
at the rate this is going ; maybe i should work everytime when liverpool got a match .. when i don't work .. the result is usually not satisfying~
so liverpool is on fire ....
we never joke at anfield !! up liverpool 
fulham are the premier league equivalent of shere punjab
i guess it's better for me not to watch liverpool games . they never win whenever i'm watching 
good job liverpool 4-0 
what a day , 3-2 win for calvary , madrid and liverpool rampant , the jt's turning it around in aberdeen . if carlsberg did football results

great football being played from liverpool . 
merseyside derby for liverpool after international break . 
i know , many will not understand this . but the quality of my weekend is so much better when wins . just makes me smile for days
about 2% of my behaviour is due to the fact i've pretty much pulled an all-nighter . the other 98% is because liverpool . sexy fucks .
liverpool bagus
 have inevitably settled into keeping possession mode ... testing the defenders when they reach the right areas . 4-0
really great to see liverpool absolutely destroying again

liverpool winning , southampton winning , obviously mancity will win , ensures manure are stuck at 8th for the next many weeks
wba drew against everton , arsenal n beat man u , other than loving 4-1 to liverpool they are a pest
how is liverpool better than chelsea this season .

86´ 2-0 85´ 1-2 71´ 0-0 86´ 4-0 87´ 3-1 
i can't wake up early or epl matches but good thing liverpool won

fulham and burnley please score . please . please

so liverpool scored 4 nd d@ mumu english boy ddn't score one ... olx straight !!!
liverpool winning 4-0 at a match i had a ticket for , bummer ( but also fab )
now this is how liverpool should play every week . keep the tempo , not defending after having a good first half .
what a performance from liverpool ... brilliant football !!!
how the fuck a player like parker ended at fulham ?
if all current results hold liverpool will move to second place 2 points behind arsenal . 
barca doe liverpool
that's right ! liverpool you are there !
said from the start that fulham will go down this season . shame really as i love martin jol 
can't remeber the last time i saw liverpool play such good football
what's the score for liverpool now ?
today in 1961 brian epstein saw the beatles playing live for the first time during a lunchtime session at the cavern liverpool .
everyone pissed there self when i said liverpool top 4 before the season started .
united fans are so concerned bout liverpool playing well , funny thing is we don't even give a shit bout ya'll .. 😂
arguing with a liverpool fan is a waste of time . they always bring up stuff they last won in the 20th century
😱😱😱😱looks like liverpool is gonna move up into second 
come on liverpool make it five 
goo liverpool ...
my liverpool day \m/
looks like liverpool have finally declared .......
liverpool to completely smash us next week
liverpool leading 4-0
it's like liverpool's the only team on the field . 
liverpool on fire .... the only team can stop sas is the gunners !!!
chelsea has about 7-10 mins to comeback with 2 goals . pray for a miracle . meanwhile liverpool is winning ! wooots ynwa !!
whoever is running the bbc website has just suggested that fulham may want to change manager during the international break .
liverpool fans follow eachother 
joe allen proved me enough why he should be on liverpool starting line up , he got so much vision and passing 
i check up on the only to find out that chelsea are losing ... and southampton have conceded so now liverpool must concede
liverpool 4 nil up !! 
awesooooome . for real fulham and the word above cant be used together in a sentence .
that fulham team should be scraped ! the effort the players put in is terrible
the top of the table is looking good for arsenal and liverpool . and southampton as it stands ... 
liverpool's pressing and work rate have been very impressive today .
frank's in a great mood , thanks liverpool 
 have played perfectly today .
just wanna be part of a world wide trend_ this is for the best football team in the world 
luis suarez - the premier league's top scorer having played 5 games less than everyone else . i think i'll forgive him now . 
fulham trying so hard not to concede the fifth goal
williams is headless chicken . probably better than what fulham have got at the mo
asal pemain liverpool handsome-handsome ni ?
liverpool have become deadly ....
liverpool awesome lewww .
so heartwarming to see liverpool trashing teams
just got home from liverpool , been spoilt 😊👗👠

suarez has two and the first liverpool goal got took off him . 😭😭 
honest poll question : how many people think liverpool will finish top 4 this year ?
i should've backed liverpool instead of chelsea smh
nothing would please me more if we go up and norwich fulham and stoke go down i know that won't happen but one should
liverpool 4-1 hull

5 mins left plus added time in the liverpool game 4 -0
love this liverpool side . quality is definitely there . only thing lacking maybe is confidence and character to dig deep when things are bad .
liverpool ... liverpool ..... liverpool
1 . arsenal , 2 . liverpool , 3 . southampton , 4 . chelsea . as results stand .
further more de men bench a man that gone liverpool now and he just scoring
it's a great day out for the fulham fans . it doesn't matter about the score , london's just shit .
if we play like this against liverpool , well .. i don't even want to think how we'll get fucking smashed
man city , man united , liverpool , arsenal never won in stamford bridge . west brom of all teams might be the first .
what is defense ? we're getting annihilated by liverpool . could we at least put up some kind of fight ?
 oushooting fulham 29 ( 10 ) to 4 ( 1 ) and has 69% of possession . up 4-0 . that's homes .
nooo , sturridge taken off . he was my fantasy captain ! oh well , who cares . liverpool are kiiling it .
remember the day i watched arsenal vs liverpool in a pub @ toxteth . had to support liverpool that day .
said fulham would go down from the start 
come on fulham ! 5 mins left for 5 goals ! 
if real madrid don't sign suarez they will regret , if liverpool let arsenal sign suarez , aah shem we can all forget about the epl
that's penalty ref | no , it's not | why ? | because you are liverpool | fvck you , ref
congrats liverpool . try again chelsea . wait for man city tomorrow .
i can see that liverpool is way better without sturridge . we can see the team work and beautiful football at the pitch .
the way my sister slapped me because i screamed out loud saying " come on liverpool " sorry but when it comes to my game i will cheer !!
if berbatov takes a appearance fee for today's game he should be charged with fraud . 
we won fulham twice 4-0 lol
" fulham are now playing with 11 men as berbatov has been substituted for karagounis " haha fuck sake ....
88´ 2-0 87´ 1-2 73´ 0-0 88´ 4-0 88´ 3-1 
stekenleberg has played really well , liverpool would have put in 6 and he stopped coutinho all the time
c'mon hibs fulham & sheffield wed 
4-0 liverpool , suarez 54 '. gerrard with another assist .
liverpool holding the ball so much its getting boring
lol fulham is still trying against liverpool
can't understand why fulham didn't play berbotov ??
how did liverpool beat west brom 4-1 .
if jol does get the sack , hope fulham go & get hughes back 
liverpool's attack is quite effective today .. ohh yeah , they deserve a big clap
magnificent liverpool . vintage stale
no team has won away at old trafford and the bridge since liverpool in 2008-09 , can west brom be about to pull that off ? 
i had liverpool saints villa preston brighton and derby on a bet but i bottled it and it was about 15-1 
liverpool just dey trol these ones
liverpool are on fire best way to bounce back !
 is kicking fulham's ass ! ⚽️

liverpool with 4 goals today ! 
arsenal , liverpool , southampton is the most old fashion top 3 i have seen in ages
good workout in ... with an easy win ... shaping up to be a nice saturday 90x 
" fulham must be crap if suarez can school them ." i don't know who my other half is anymore ....
if this is everton , thy may as well not turn up for the scouse derby . liverpool will spank them
slow second half . at times , liverpool likes to follow opponent's rhythm when they should be the one controlling the game pace
what is it with liverpool slowing down so much in the second half ?
nearly did a liverpool/chelsea double . thank fuck !
thorpe lost , coupons bust but liverpool have dicked all over fulham so every cloud
cable sports networks : you're not carrying enough liverpool games , and my daughter holds me personally responsible . i'm afraid . help me .
never missed even one liverpool goal . all i had to do was switch the channel when my neighbours start screaming hahahaha
john hartson has been impressed with jordan henderson . just how shit are fulham ?
update score : la liga madrid 5 vs 1 sociedad ,.. epl chelsea 1 vs 2 wba , liverpool 3 vs 0 fulham
yeah alright liverpool fans we have you a stuffing last week - don't get too carried alway against fulham
i am - shockingly - actually enjoying this liverpool-fulham match . such a change from the lfc of even a year ago .

fulham sux btw . martin jol sack pls the defence is horrendous

good performance by liverpool 👍
87 played 4-0 to liverpool .
in the two previous premier league seasons that liverpool have recorded a 6-2-2 record after 10 games , they have finished 3rd and 4th .
without wishing to fan any flames , with an international break coming up it could be a good time to change a manager ... 
the fact that mike myers came to watch liverpool against fulham was really awesome . 
haha liverpool chanting we love west brom 
we love you liverpool we do , we love you liverpool we do , we love you liverpool we doooo , ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh liverpool we love you
i prefer chelsea rather than liverpool idk why lol
one more liverpool
while liverpool is enjoying the night , chelsea seems struggling to equalise .
loool . liverpool going back to second . lmao
lots of hands on hips from fulham players today . they look less than ordinary but we've played very well again . great response to last week .
liverpool is taking revenge on fulham oooo . arsenal can be so motivating . * smile
liverpool promised to bounce back and they have , fair play .
liverpool confirm menang 
villa , saints , chelsea , liverpool , everton would have been my 5-fold for today . who’d’ve seen west ham taking the lead ?

wearing a liverpool kit 😂😂😂🔫
fulham are just so shit
great game by liverpool this afternoon #4 -0 
this ref is just wanting to give fulham something to take away . a foul for that with enrique ? ridiculous !

it would be great for football neutrals if arsenal or liverpool win the 
if you asked me last year i never would have thought arsenal liverpool and south hampton would be at the top of the premier league . wow
always brightens my day when liverpool are smashin it
can't believe fulham fans are booing berbatov , you'd never have seen that at united ...
fulham coach looks unimpressed
knew gerrard would bounce back , 3 assists this game , 4-0 liverpool !!
our next four games ... liverpool ( h ) stoke ( h ) united ( a ) and arsenal ( a) . drastic changes needed !
mignolet could have flied to naples to give reina his gloves and fulham still wouldn't have scored . 
if the blues play like this or last week against liverpool we will get destroyed
is anyone a fulham fan here ? cos you lot are getting the piss taken outta you ! 
liverpool 💪
another 3 points ! another 2 goals and more importantly liverpool are winning !! 
3 points for liverpool tonight :d
west brom beat utd at old trafford , draw to us and as things look beat chelsea .. but loose to liverpool ? wtf
a bare screw face on fulham team dwl
liverpool make the most noise against all these small clubs
fulham scored 4 past these . 4 !!!
good job liverpool 
we love you liverpool we do , ooo liverpool we love you :) 
fulham player has touched the ball ... then enrique gets in back ... how is enrique offside kmt
yes it's fulham , but the defensive pressure has been outstanding . 
i'm far to excited for mumma kim and nan to come to liverpool
p.s. what was the fulham score ?
liverpool way too small for suarez .
yeshhhh liverpool back to second !
liverpool are 4 - 1 ahead
89´ 2-0 88´ 1-2 75´ 0-0 89´ 4-0 90´ 4-1

liverpool still smashing teams then ... saints still romping home against ' hard to break down ' teams ... 
what a great day personally ! my wba boys grind out a win , lfc beat up fulham and real murder sociedad ! loving football today ! 
l'pool is tearing fulham apart
funny bc he supports liverpool aswell ????? wtf
liverpool 2 points behind arsenal ... chelsea losing ... 
i see liverpool has learned a few things from arsenal
martin jol has not moved an inch from that bench . this what playing liverpool does to a decent manager ! 
thanking the lord that i'm not at home to feel the wrath of rosie the football hooligan , the fulham score is heartbreaking 😰😠💔
liverpool mean business this session
jol is a good manager , but this side is far too old . he'll be out before fulham play again , and it will be the wrong decision .
hahahahaha dad's jealous of liverpool's score xd
come on , fulham , you shits . i've got money on 4-1
if jol is still at fulham come tuesday morning i will be surprised , pool have had 30 shots upto yet , fulham might as well stayed on coach
liverpool are back
any fulham fans out there still backing jol ? if so , why ? 
liverpool n saints are flying ! pity saints didn't do the business midweek #£👎
fulham don't deserve to have a share of the possession in this game
liverpool fans should sing ynwa by now .
my 28kth tweet goes to liverpool . i love you so much :')
joe allen has looked good since coming on . reminiscence of his first few games for liverpool . but henderson has been superb throughout .
fulham disappointed but westbrom didn't
 for fit add two more goals & spell .
wonderful game for liverpool
liverpool are now protecting their lead of 4 goals .... ~bharat~
i hate liverpool
had to do a double take when i saw that liverpool player with ' allen ' on his back . i'd honestly forgotten all about him !
hahaha and you thought the liverpool twitter account was horrible !
disappointing result for liverpool ... suarez didnot score a hattrick and sturiddge didnot even get on the score sheet ...
arsenal styl got a better goal difference then liverpool ! & we gonna beat man - u tomorrow
wow .... liverpool are impressive this season like
the ref is seeing for liverpool !
rodgers bringing the good times back to liverpool
fulham should get a new coach . i mean that team's got players that are capable of putting a team on mid table .. 
liverpool are goin in on the other hand chelsea is losing 
oh yes ! liverpool , well suarez destroying fulham ...
congrats liverpool ♡ 
we love you liverpool we do , we love you liverpool we do , we love you liverpool we doooo , ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh liverpool we love you ~

would be stunned if martin jol is in the fulham dugout next saturday
stat of the day . there are 4 teams in the league worse than this fulham side . remarkable . 
some great football today against a very poor fulham !! 
don't know why the media are down on martin jol ! he's a good manager , & fulham had had some tough games ! fulham will be grand with him !
one more goal liverpool , one more ...
up liverpool
sympathy for fulham this season . has a tough season . struggling more than past season .
how to beat fulham in 140 characters or less : play a high line and press . victory is guaranteed .
liverpool doing christmas right ! the lights are fucking awesome . 
liverpool second place ? for a while ny , they will walk alone soon ;) hahaha
konfem liverpool potong tempat chelsea no 2 . good step . good job
liverpool starting to look a massive threat and mufc starting to pick up form ??? about as wide open as a slag on a friday night .
liverpool are smashing it here !
liverpool liverpool !!!
liverpool op
great win villa . nice even money double on liverpool and southampton too . 
why can't we play fulham all the time
re-tweeted warning ; fulham broadway underground overloaded going towards earls court
remember the end of last season , when people ridiculed the major syndicates for the prices they were sending liverpool and saints off at ?
watched chelsea play like crapped . couldn't stand it . so i switched it to liverpool's match .
getting fed up of being a fulham fan now , they'll a bunch of muppets 
when we mullered fulham at home last season , jol refused to give us any credit . think he was still smarting from dempseygate .
liverpool 2nd ! 2 defeats in 19 games ! he's not a bad manager brendan rogers is he ?
please just sack jol for god's sake fulham !!
liverpool
pass and move , it's the liverpool groove !!!! 
liverpool should be like 12-0 up by now .
go liverpool !
none of my prediction for premier league games have gone to plot other than liverpool winning against fulham
liverpool and saints both demolishing 👌
hull are shite . fulham are shite . we are ....
go liverpool ........... chelsea is losing 2-1
fulham are such a depressing team to support
had enough . fuck off fulham , fuck right off .
watching the liverpool game and its actually like watching men against boys
fantastic afternoon with the liverpool screen school watching the madness that is ' boom '. great question and answer session with john waters
for awhile you're a liverpool fan then sometime you're arsenal fan . man , i see how much craze you have over soccer 😒
so many failed passes by liverpool
liverpool winning handsomely . don't how i'll encounter my office lead on monday .
an attack with some urgency would be nice . especially as we have liverpool , united and arsenal in our next 4 games .
john they're playing fulham ffs !!!!
focus on liverpool game xd
are liverpool back ?
liverpool are slapping fulham about - basically .
if liverpool get some addition to there squad january . they can be title contenders . have nothing but the league to play for
yes !! 3 point to liverpool !! 
fulham very poor ! but best complete 90 mins i've seen us play this season !!
' we love you liverpool , we do . we love you liverpool , we do . we love you liverpool , we do . ohh liverpool we love you !!'
how good are liverpool playing though
tbh , he scored 2 goals and played well but motm has to be somebody in that midfield , totally bossed fulham . talk about dominance !
liverpool bound ! national quarter finals tomorrow ! 67kg winner by unanimous decision is ... ;-) 
they keep saying " realistically " liverpool can't win the league . i'm starting to think they're wrong ......
can i be a liverpool and man u fan now
referees been pretty crap today tbh .. he feels sorry for fulham
liverpool fans only talk wen they are winning las weekend they were so quiet
scoreline flattering fulham to be very honest .
liverpool fuck u
my team is just playing full force for days , i love it :d 
come on west brom ! we want 5 as well liverpool gg
liverpool !
both and have been linked to 's max meyer . reported fee of €12m . [ via swol ] 
if every one is saying . who is a realistic sensible replacement ? 
when chelsea loses and liverpool wins , i could have my balls smashed in by a table drawer because .... its already a great day
so we've already played liverpool .. man city .. chelsea .. soton .. and next is arsenal .. hmmm december here we come ! 
how have liverpool scored 4 , and yet sturridge has still been an awful choice for a fantasy football captain ?
great matchday . liverpool and real madrid both win . ynwa ! hala madrid !
lets missrlondon.com 📩
i pity stekelenburg ... he is holland's no 1 keeper ..... fun fact van der sar was also from fulham ... how many of you know this ??
dis victory rises up liverpool :)
inspired today by the lads from liverpool ! well done red men ! 
nice work .
liverpool please catch up with those arseholes
i was confident about liverpool , i was secretly confident about dortmund , but im not feeling confident about tomorrow
 defense is god awful . you can't expect to ever win when giving up 3 or 4 often
luis suarez is now the joint top scorer even though he missed the first 5 games . 
fulham played shit today lul ful
liverpool !
liverpool frosh
preparing like a mini dance over here for liverpool 
one more please liverpool ....
i was optimistic to beat fulham , and we succeeded in that . well done ! 
chelsea and fulham could be after new managers after today's results !
top four ( my opinion ) man city chelsea arsenal liverpool
i really forgat that allen plays for liverpool . -_-
liverpool have had 29 shots hahahhaa
we could've really used charlie adam today . fulham too good
think it's safe to say liverpool smashed it !: )))
liverpool's looking very good this season , it's pretty obvious that brendan rodgers has got the kop believing again .
liverpool and arsenal are really gunning for this title dawg
i blame adel trabaat for fulham's demise
i'm liverpool fans since 2009
great performance madrid and liverpool ! gonna go study now :'(
fulham are terrible . suarez is unreal . i'm a happy man
there will be some sackings before the next game ...... jol has to be one . fulham are awful !!!
fulham are dreadful smh . taxi for jol unfortunately .
crazy pl this season , all the top sides dropping points vs weaker sides . liverpool will never have a better chance to win it
gud stufff liverpool !!!
liverpool and everton clean sheets would add just a hint of footballing satisfaction this afternoon
just noticed that city have the highest goal difference this season +17 , behind them are arsenal(+13 ) and liverpool(+11 )
liverpool win and chelsea loss looks possible
liverpool dunnoeee
successful trip to liverpool , prom dress bought and in the car with us !, they still want to hear the truth from you ,,,"
liverpool please chelsea need one of your goals now
liverpool possession in second half is 69% . yes , 69% ! the comeback is on . eek ! 
was putting a fiver on liverpool to win 4-0 wrote it out then decided against it . i'm sick as a dog here . and chelsea let me down out of 8
a great win for liverpool . one game at a time . 
a clean sheet for liverpool . 👍
omg liverpool ......
damn liverpool took 30 shots
as a liverpool fan take nothing from there performance played very well today , my god though fulham are shocking berbatov sulking all game
liverpool stole the game tonight .
know its only fulham but our mid of gerrard , lucas , allen and hendo have been solid , mobile and pressing high up the pitch today . 
so proud of liverpool . 🙏🙏 . glorydays .
only liverpool & southampton has not let me down
liverpool fc has given me the best bday gift ever .. 3 points my guy . three points yoh¡¡
both celtic & liverpool won today , good day
liverpool :)
fulham will get relegated
hahahaha liverpool trashing fulham seyy !! fuyooh someone happy only !! :)
 just have no heart . painful to watch .
dear chris coleman , surely you would rather come to a team you once played for as apposed to a team you once managed ? 
watching liverpool this season is such a big difference from watching them last season😀
so good to be back in the presence of sheep cows and chickens , liverpool misses out on this kind of excitement
to be fair , fulham look like they work in a museum . 
i sure do would like to see more urgency from liverpool . they tend to lay off after midway through the second half .
same here . chelsea slipped up but liverpool on tings
3 minute again in second half 4 v 0 fulham 
referee in the liverpool game has been fucking awful
bien liverpool
liverpool have had 30 shots on goal😂😂
liverpool , i'm so proud of you :)
here's hoping fulham don't sack martin jol , still a big fan as i'm sure many spurs fans are .
 1 . liverpool over 3 , real madrid over 4 , bayern munchen over 3.5 , chelsea over 3 - . - zonk di munchen - . -
swear he's taking sympathy on fulham , that's not how it works you mingey fuck . the rules , man .
come on fulham please just score !!!!!!!
berbatov would look boss alongside someone like suarez , but he's not what fulham need - they need hard work & industry . 
this isn’t a great liverpool performance , its a shit fulham performance . not title contenders .
i love my jersey , my home jersey yeehaa 
martin jol going ... going .... will be surprised if he sees xmas in fulham .
good win today for liverpool (& wba ;)
martin jol won't be fulham manager when we go to craven cottage 
fulham are one of those teams that either do well or do just about enough to stay in the bpl .
too many negative everton fans today ok were not winning , liverpool are playing fulham not real madrid there not that good
fulham are losing 4-0 yet they are the ones time wasting
liverpool fc !! 4-0 !!
fulham annihilation complete . 
we love you liverpool we do , oh liverpool we love you

as i wind down watching this fulham match , i have seen some bad performances in my lifetime by clubs i support , this was one of the worst .
hard to tell if liverpool took their foot off the gas ever because fulham sort of did too . instant relegation is a possibility .
today liverpool win , and if tomorrow marquez wins the motogp i'll buzzing !!!
gotta hand it to liverpool , they dominate teams 16-20 .
chelsea and liverpool both had 69% possession
magical , delightful & enjoyful football today by liverpool .

liverpool wins and chelsea screws up again ... beautiful day
results going nicely - bar liverpool - at present . win for us - and utd - tomorrow would be rather agreeable , would it not ? 
i think arsenal , liverpool , chelsea , city and swansea play the most eye catching , beautiful football in the league . maybe southampton too .
impressive perfomance from liverpool today . liverpool up to 2nd following chelsea's shock result at stamford bridge .
the fulham bus should have left by now . they have been poor and the bus must have departed anfield by now .
west brom covering their + 1.50 asian line nicely then ... liverpool - 1.75 looking comfortable too . shame hoffenheim couldn't have won too
liverpool beat/beating the shit fulham 4-0
liverpool 4-0 up . real madrid wins , ronaldo hat-trick . simply a good day
liverpool and southampton did what was expected for my accumulator . chelsea , however , have given me another reason to hate them .
4-0 has flattered fulham in this game .
great game liverpool 😍👏
great results liverpool won , chelsea loss . 2nd now !

think that defeat at liverpool might be the end of the road for martin jol at fulham .
reckon palace , fulham and norwich could go down . almost certain palace will , jol will be sacked if results don't improve soon .
as i said last week home games against teams like fulham are where he is most in his element .
4-0 ! couldn't have asked for a better response from liverpool after a frustrating defeat last week .
why didn't west brom frustrate liverpool too -_-

it was a game we should have won . probably a fair result but we should have started with more purpose like liverpool .
we had 32 shots against fulham . with nearly 70% possession . everton drawing against palace . just as i predicted haha
luis suarez scored his eighth goal in six premier league outings as liverpool strode to a 4-0 win over an inept fulham side at anfield .

final , chelsea 2 wba 2 , a villa 2 cardiff 0 , liverpool 4 fulham 0 , southampton 4 hull 1
expected chelsea to get 6pts while arsenal took on liverpool and united
luis suarez 2 goals + assist dint get any bonus points in . rvp scores one , bonus points for free ! 
full time : 4-0 for liverpool
although fulham offered little , a clean sheet is very good to see . back four with agger is better , it seems . .
what the win of liverpool
suarez 2 goals gerrard 2 assists liverpool in 2nd 
amazing weekend can be defined as when liverpool gets full 3 points ! 
liverpool ..........
fantastic result . 4-0 ! absolutely hammered fulham in possession 68% - 32% . onwards and upwards ! 
liverpool are improving #19
woo . liverpool win 4-0 and move back up to second place in the tables .
well done 
liverpool are playing fantastic football .
managed to salvage a point ... but liverpool are definitely gonna move ahead of us
meanwhile liverpool climbs to second spot ... only two points behind arsenal now .
still not happy with the draw , how will we keep up with liverpool and arsenal now ?
liverpool's game is awesome . ggwp ! but when i switched channel to chelsea's game ... ugh ! bad call referee .
if the chelsea & fulham players get fined for bringing the game into disrepute so should the refs , it is there fault for 90% of the problems
liverpool wicked oo :(
stats vs possession% : 68 vs 32 passes : 722 vs 316 accuracy passing% : 90 vs 81 shots ( on target ): 32(10 ) vs 4(1 )
liverpool wins
3 great points ..... rip fulham
its not about us being top , its about how far ahead of our real rivals . city chelsea will be for defo , assume utd too . liverpool maybe .
happiness is starting off the weekend with a liverpool win

liverpool won !! 4-0 
refs just won't change big teams get decisions including my own tea liverpool in this but disgrace about chelsea penalty by all accounts
this is why teams like spurs or wba suffer because the refs are so biased towards keeping chelsea , man utd , city , liverpool and arsenal happy

chelsea are lucky bastards ! never deserve that pen nor the point ... nevertheless , liverpool climbed above them to put pressure on arsenal !
yes liverpool ! in recent years they would've drawn a game like today . great win
rampant reds . liverpool . rampant reds . 2nd in the table . rampant reds . .

swindon gets bounced from the fa cup by macclesfield . so , not a great weekend for nerdfighter teams . ( except for liverpool . dang , son . )
