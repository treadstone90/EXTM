class if we beat everton away 4 level
who's liverpool's left back ? mirralas dey use use am ruff
nobody else is awake to freak out about liverpool vs everton with me

everton's wingers look dangerous together with lukaku up front .

25 mins in and everton are already playing long ball football
everton vs liverpool
love liverpool playing flanagan . :) he's really good , keep playing him . :)
flanno - get a grip son . everton players facing no resistance in dribbling past him 
remember that mirallas chose to go to everton instead of arsenal
everton spamming them balls to lukaku
unbelievable actually defended a set piece
nothing better than the merseyside derby 
everton taken lessons from the howard wilkinson school of footy . lump up front . bore off
i really hope that everton and liverpool draw .
all the liverpool friends going crazy .
what's the liverpool score ?
great to see rushie in the crowd . great ambassador for liverpool fc he is .

elsewhere , merseyside derby is heating up . 
are you guys watching everton vs liverpool ..??
everton are playing like villa , hoof it up benteke/lukaku and it never works
flanagan is really struggling , was left in mirallas ' dust as the everton winger skipped past him and released a bullet of a shot just wide
ffs i forgot about the everton liverpool game ffs
liverpool ;)
major difference between baines & emilio is the quality of crossing . baines delivery is mostly top drawer . 
everton are playing for the chipped through ball fifa glitch to lukaku ....
liverpool , liverpool !
as in the fixture last year , mirallas is everton's most important player . flanagan's covering him decently , but agger isn't helping .
ross barkley is an unbelievable talent . hope martinez stays as everton manager for years and hounds him too keep his quality
how's it 2-1 to liverpool should be to everton , 
go on lunch to find liverpool winning 2-1 . buzzing üòõ
this everton v liverpool game is an absolute cracker
everton didn't come to joke at all . i just want ' em to equalise .
this liverpool and everton game is goooood !
sadness is not watching the merseyside derby :'( :'( :'(
everton 1 - 2 liverpool 
this everton side is much more entertaining than david moyes's everton .
everton have way too much room to operate
the aerodynamic drag from tim howard's rick ross beard allowed that goal to happen 
everton pressing well . need more from gerrard & hendo .
i think liverpool mean business this season .
kevin mirallas almost draws level for everton but his shot goes inches wide 
everton's goal keeper looks like an abraham lincoln wannabe
c'mon everton !
do everton still give away free season tickets with phones ?
mirallas !!!......... makes the liverpool back line look like mannequins and unleashes a belter in the process
would love mirallas at liverpool .. great player
merseyside derby abis itu dortmund vs muenchen what a day
the real winner of the merseyside derby is my shoelaces . i'm in newcastle so they won't get nicked !
come on liverpool !! 
don't remember joe allen passing the ball forwards at any point in his liverpool career ..
what the everton say ? ouch-ouch-ouch-ouch-ouch ! 
merseyside is redd .
merseyside derby on one screen , rugby league world cup semi on the other . 
really like barkley for everton . has the dembele quality of gliding past defenders & also has a great passing range .
liverpool
nice to see ian rush growing his moustache back 
i thought everton had al-habsi in goal ...
everton x liverpool

everton's defense is too risky . one lapse of concentration from one of their defenders and suarez will be away to score .
dive somemore everton so pathetic
liverpool are winning but we can't hear their fans , i love how medias still think they are the best fans in england .
another everton player diving ??

yes up the top we go cos that's where we belong . up liverpool , ynwa
here's a free lesson : when the referee points towards the everton goal , the foul is on everton .
that's why we have private jets . suarez was flown back from uruguay's world cup quali v jordan on liverpool owner john henry's private jet .
 everton vs liverpool
when did ashley young start playing for everton ? 
liverpool needs to secure more possession
phil neville obviously left his legacy on the everton youngsters

gotta say everton looking very good .

suarez ..... fwee .... is raining
a booking for simulation in a merseyside derby who would have thought ..........
barkley aside , all this " free flowing , pressing , attacking football " everton side is doing is hoofing it to lukaku 
first for derby merseyside , second for der klassiker . super saturday ! 
it would have benefited both club and player better if victor moses had gone to the blue half of merseyside instead .
barkley with the flop . sounds like a basketball highlight from 25 years ago but it was an player who dove
a very competitive match between the merseyside .

coutinho on the periphery , joe allen's pressing in midfield is starting to stem the flow , though doubt if everton can keep this up for 90
liverpool ain't in the clear with this game yet

suarez is too gud to be at liverpool .... real madrid is the ideal club for him !
wow merseyside derby is buzzing ..

it's fucks me off when all the liverpool players gather round the ref
27.5 million for fellaini . a player that everton haven't missed and man utd haven't really gained from . early , yes . but costly , yes .
liverpool was the first ever club i support
if liverpool do make it into the top 4 , i have a feeling suarez will pull a cavani(napoli fans know what i'm talking about) .
i love this liverpool squad ..

everton fans are just making themselves look like fools booing that yellow card
how is that not a red card ? dowd bottled it big time . everton very lucky there
who scored for everton ?
ew dog liverpool's doctor . you are just a doctor . not qualified to talk to the referee for the player to see red .
if that was a liverpool player we would have gotten red 
everton must draw dis match ooo
 yellow card - kevin mirallas ( phew )

suarez is on fire this season liverpool need to hope madrid don't come for him in january
why don't tottenham fucking score like liverpool
i bet the merseyside derby is the fixture with the most tax payers money spent on the tickets
ffs disappointed liverpool players didn't complain more
definitely a tactic by liverpool to give the ref some time to think about this . you've got to get him off quicker if he's that hurt 
everton sucks some ball sagna
liverpool fans keep tweeting " suarez missed the first 5 games " not are fault he likes eating humans !

everton - liverpool
ridiculous . don't get me wrong i'm routing for everton here .... but that was an awful tackle . suarez bleeding from where the studs hit .
incompetence ref everton should be down to ten there .
come on everton 
mirallas being a bit naughty there , although the liverpool physio needs to have a word with himself . everton targeting suarez ' knee ?
everton fans celebrating not getting a red card and for a shit tackle !! people's club !! too club !!
liverpool's doctor looks like timmy from rules of engagement 
mirallas deserved a red for that . dirty everton player

madness in rileys in liverpool
i wonder if the wreckless challenge brigade will be out in liverpool's favour tonight

watch every liverpool player try an absolutely smash mirallas now ! 
nice to see liverpool players getting miralles booked
only an yellow to mirallas is criminal . you can see the studs on the side of suarez ' right knee . 
oh liverpool is leading yay !
that was a red card offence . mirallas n everton lucky to get away with a yellow
everton fans will love that , yellow card and suarez limping off
too early for a sending off in the merseyside derby üòèüòèüòè
i hate liverpool and suarez but how wasn't that a red ?
lucky everton !! just a yellow !!
it's the inconsistency that fucks football fans off the most . i have no love for either team , but the everton player had to walk there
it would have been standard merseyside derby procedure if everton had gotten a red card
live text and radio commentary as everton host liverpool in the merseyside derby before six other premier league games .
 everton - liverpool
who puts distin in his fantasy team . riding on the coattails of an in-form everton team
dirty everton scum ! shit club
wth yellow card ?!?! that just made everton happy for injuring our player - . -
kevin mirallas lucky to get away with just a yellow card for a nasty-looking challenge on suarez . still 2-1 liverpool , 36 mins gone 
stupid everton injured suarez
cowards challenge , everton clearly have some nasty tactics .
suarez walks off on his own power and the liverpool physio shoves the ref , and lfc fans are crying about no red ? 
so a player was hobbling on his knee , keeps playing and an everton player goes studs up and high on that knee , and it's a yellow ?
everton boo boys at it again
there is a pokemon by the name of skrtel playing for liverpool .
watch mirallas will get everton something from this game now
ref everton's 12th man

everton you want kill suarez issit ?
a red card challenge = an everton yellow card . help me out here ? i'm a little confused
look down to everton ... üëé
just about right from the ref ... but utterly brainless from the player . will only add to the bitterness in the match .
everton fans . studded in the knee , studs up , very dangerous challenge . saying suarez is a cheat . 
i'm an everton fan , and surprised mirallas is still on the pitch .
hope liverpool tear everton a new arsehole now
as much as i hate liverpool that should have been a red !
mirallas has almost won this game for everton , if suarez can't make it back .... i wanted a fair balanced game ... sigh
mums decided to look around every shop in westfield so now i've missed the start of everton v liverpool . sket
notice , liverpool players swamp ref , evertons stand back .
let's do this everton !!
dunno what the physio said there , but the everton players didn't like it !
anging how even the liverpool medical team even cheat
its no surprise i'm hearing countinho is doing the dirt for liverpool , everton do us a favour tho !
a yellow ??? come on . everton got away with one there
everton got away with a clear red card !
that's a red card in my books , hopefully everton capitalise on this !
i cant digest the fact that perez bought illara for 38 m while suarez was offered by liverpool and himself for 45 m and he didnt bought him
alamat streaming e lfc vs everton opo yo ?
poor , very poor by phil dowd .. 
liverpool quiere ganar en goodison park
how much did everton pay for james mccarthy ??? üôà

apparently , liverpool must not win this match biko . everton , what's up :( ?!
can't believe that only got a yellow card . high studs right into his leg . poor decision by dowd . and i'm an everton fan .

yellow ? like hell ! dirty everton cheats !
what is the liverpool physio playing at there ? what a cretin . horrible challenge from mirallas gets a yellow card .
 - everton .
what is the liverpool physio playing at though . being a cunt
liverpool fans calling barkley a cheating cunt ? i'm sorry what is suarez ?
how is that a yellow ? hahaha . suarez injured + mirallas survives = everton should make it count .
should've been a red , oh well come on everton
everton vs liverpool 
2-1 pour liverpool 
mirallas is very lucky there . could have cost everton the game if he was sent off .
should be a red card for everton - . -
yellow you fucking everton cunt ref !!!! dirty cunts 
only a yellow ; mirallas a lucky boy . it looked like dowd's view was obstructed due to his angle , su√°rez blocking his view . 
yellow card ?! it's the merseyside derby , give him a red !
everton can't stop him so try and maim him . seen
could have been a red , everton got away with one there
ahhh suarez must be liverpool true . his blood is red .

shocker of a challenge by everton's maralles . should have been a red .
everton fans booing that decision , clearly they thought too that mirallas should have seen red . 
 . you " ll never walk alone , liverpool fc ,
just bought a book about liverpool's no 9 fernando torres .
if that was a liverpool player , it would have been red
should've been off the filthy everton piece of piss
liverpool v everton fascinating match
typical every decision to everton again should have been of stupid cunts
the liverpool physio thinks he's a don coming on the pitch chatting shit to barry
everton fans boo mirallas ' booking , you should be cheering it - lucky to be on the pitch .
hate everton with a passionüò†
suarez is the epl top scorer despite missing 5games agreed but against which big team has he scored apart from everton 
spending saturday night for streaming merseyside derby . this is what i called " grow some balls ".
liverpool will not sell this guy
liverpool e everton , gente
liverpool üòç
sofian goes on a mad one when liverpool play
that is absolutely awful . no place in the game for that . everton are extremely lucky there .
ma team winning go hard 
liverpool .
dirty everton scum
 everton lucky not to be down to 9 men . elbow at the corner should have been a red as well .
love you mirallas , what a hit ! 
fuck mirallas . this is what everton were planning all along 
i have a very deep admiration for everton . a good team of players very willing to chase every ball .
fuck you everton hahaha
liverpool fans better enjoy watching suarez .. he'll be in a madrid shirt soon enough .
everton will some luck with that yellow .
what a shocking decision all day a red if it was a tackle on any other liverpool player he gives a red but cause it's suarez he doesn't
we must win if liverpool win this derby !
lol mirallas knows how to cancel out the biggest liverpool threat
rugby league , merseyside derby , racing and top14 rugby with clermont v racing metro ... can the remote cope !
yellow for mirallas the ref is on the everton payroll
if i were martinez , i'd sub mirallas at the nearest opportunity . dowd/liverpool will look to get him sent off very soon .
that's a disgrace . should be a straight red 
yellow ??? you'll pay for this , 4eva
that liverpool physio was a right tosspot , stick to your job 
dirty , everton . dirty .
i want everton win here but that was defo a red !
he knew exactly what he was doing there the gobshite . same old everton .
liverpool sending on the 5th offical there .
disgraceful refereeing or maybe he's just blind . how that everton player wasn't sent off is beyond me .
suarez is brilliant , dont like him in a liverpool shirt but that was a nasty tackle .
i want everton to win , but that foul by mirallas was horrendous and deserved more than a yellow card . 
 liverpool vs everton
get home like 2 mins ago and liverpool are doing well so far :d
how wasn't that a red !? everton are cheating bastards
if suarez goes off , liverpool are fucked , there shit without suarez hahaha
mirallas should be off there ! liverpool physio shouldn't be getting involved though .
that should have been a red card bro . but yeah , its merseyside derby . don't want to ruin it eh ref ?
come on liverpool ! 
100% definatly a red , basically sayin everton can do that an injure more players and get away with it . shit ref
could have been a straight red . if suarez has trouble coming back , everton would take that trade every time
haha liverpool fans will go on about the " gash " but obviously have nothing to say about carragher on nani
liverpool wanting a red card for that tackle loool
 derby sounds lively
one lucky everton boy !!! hi challange should of been red 
cracking match this merseyside derby . well worth it to be up this early .
if that was a liverpool player that made that challenge it would've been a sending off , though
cracking match this merseyside derby . well worth it to be up this early .
c'mon everton !!
 liverpool vs everton
everton going to be targeting suarez's leg now ...
oh my goodness , i can't watch liverpool's game . huaaaaa :'(
liverpool too nice . should have staged a scuffle .
david moyes definetly brought the wrong everton player to united 
liverpool vs evertonüòÅüòÅüòÅ
suarez was just assaulted - should have been a red card . 
that was a red ... surely . i'd love to back everton here but that challenge was late , very high and with studs raised well over the ball 
boo suarez all you want . there has already been a dive and a wreckless challange . both from everton !
30 mins . a few too many cooks there for everton as a number of blus shirts lined up on the edge of the area , but not one had a crack at goal
liverpool 2 - 1 everton
my future wife is so gonna die if she doesn't support liverpool .
 everton / liverpool
hear the blue nose shite cheerin for mirallas ? everton aren't they
everton body checking all the time
two reasons a red was not given : players pressuring the ref and suarez's reputation . 
mirallas was simply kicking racism out of football 
he is there to do nothing but assist with injuries , can't believe he was talking to the ref and mouthing off to everton players .
mirallas is very lucky there ! easily a straight red . no need for liverpool's physio to get involved with the referee though . foh !
that ought to have been a red card for miralas . liverpool should rightly feel hard done by .
 i don't see liverpool winning this one . it's gonna be a 3-3 draw !!!!!!
everton are dirty cunts .
cheatin everton twats
liverpool don't like it up em
stud marks on suarez's legs . everton lucky to still have 11 on the field .
how's liverpool playing , i ain't got access to the match .
what's the merseyside derby like ? only just woken up !!
fuck everton give da prick red card grrrrr yellow to good oggyes kool holllaaa
everton is full of cheating pricks
everton fans are so fickle ! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
great challenge from there . perfectly fair tackle . if suarez can lift his leg , there's nothing wrong .
my nan is too funny when she watches everton hahahaüòÇ
fuck please don't be injured suarez liverpool are screwed if you are .... :/
every time liverpool does something stupid is level cuss going on between adam and dad o.o
if liverpool score 3 , everton must score 3 oooo
hopefully liverpool stay focused on the game and not look for revenge
liverpool medical guy influencing a referee's decision ? wtf ? definitely scouse , crap tash ! dirty cheating kopite bin dipping ... 
i think it's safe to say that 90% of the angst that suarez is exhibiting is theatrical in nature . 
liverpool physio deserves a slap . 
even though i'm not a liverpool fan that should of been a red card . suarez would of got sent off if he done that challenge
everton were never so dirty under david moyes
hahaha the liverpool physio looking for a fight . legend
ma≈üallah though liverpool üôå
everton fans booing for a yellow , lucky to still be on the pitch .
really ?? mirallas doesn't get a red for that challenge ?? 
has gerrard passed to a liverpool shirt today ? been awful .
dowd bottled it there . shouldn't be allowed to referee another merseyside derby 
everton 1 - 2 liverpool 37min
nice to see phil dowd thinking he's the centre of attention 
liverpool !! :)
oh yeah i forgot everton appeal for everything
come on everton ! do united a favour and smash them
the ref was not going to send off a everton player , in the merseyside derby , at home .
we all know suarez won't be in liverpool next season . you know this right ??
i'm not even a liverpool fan and i think that was just wank
me mum having kittens at my dad forgetting he's in lancaster not liverpool , giving it loads üòÇüòÇüòÇ
everton 1-2 liverpool suarez doing what he loves doing best ¬ª scoring !
to put it in to perspective all you liverpool fans , suarez bit someone and didn't even get a yellow .
i'm not watching football today but the tl + my liverpool fan flat mate are top class entertainment üòÇüòÇ
viendo el everton vs liverpool . go reds !!!!
studs up straight for the knee is only a yellow when you're liverpool
that should of been a red card to that everton player . enough said ! at least we're winning 2-1 
liverpool
there i was , lying in bed , not knowing liverpool were playing everton . 
why was the liverpool physio getting involved though
i would give a yellow because the liverpool physio can't do what he did ! but would of been hard to argue with a red
everton fucking dirty cunts 
that could've been red ! lucky call for everton !!!
what was liverpool physio at . look after player rather than fight with everton players .
missing the liverpool game bc i'm on the train uuugh 2-1 lads keep it up
if suarez did the same to an everton player he'd get 8 weeks . tell me i'm wrong .
the longer that went on , the less likely it felt that mirallas was going to see red . maybe ghosts of merseyside derbies got to him . 
i dont give a damn of . liverpool is playin ' . tolong lahh !!
liverpool physio 
as much as i hate liverpool and there fans i love watching gerrard and suarez play
please , hope merseyside derby will be draw ended
haha got to love liverpool fansüòÇ
dirty everton play
everton player a very lucky boy to still be on the park
everton player plants studs in suarez's leg = suarez is still a filthy cheat . 
i just noticed my uniform looks just like liverpool's . noe that's cool
comon merseyside blue
liverpool fans may be seeing their slim title hopes disappear as suarez gets clattered . surely a red ? only a yellow
eveton -liverpool ref should have given red for that tackle
i love all these imaginary fks everton fans appeal for .
liverpool lead 2-0
i'm not a fan of red cards but that was a stone wall one . 
now liverpool vs everton
watever luh i hope liverpool win
everton just play like stoke , dirty bastards
harap seri game liverpool
ugh everton
come on liverpool !
liverpool 3 points please witt witt
disgraceful behaviour in the last few minutes from everton . a yellow for diving followed by what should have been a red 
everton are the new stoke . 
it's 1d day , dw day , and liverpool is up 2-1 against everton ... today's gunna be a great day
should have been a red card . everton got lucky
everton fans and their constant appealing for handball is the worst thing in football by a distance
snide tackles . long balls . everton .
refs bottled it 
now any complaints from liverpool fans are worthless because of every single false card suarez has induced/avoided of course .
everton pls do it 4 me ......!!!!!
mirallas very lucky not to get a red there , it's a great game game but that was an awful challenge 
and the dirty everton fans were booing the card and suarez like it was a good tackle fuck em .
merseyside derby should be about tackles like miralles just did . class !
first half an our , 10 fouls made ... where else but merseyside ?
everton lucky to continue with 11
2-1 liverpool 37 mins into the game 
ah yes , go liverpool :p
same old everton , always cheating . 
that's it everton fans , he's got two wounds on his leg where the studs went in . comes back on the field and you boo 
love u liverpool .. suarez !!
goaaaalll suarez ! everton 1-2 lfc 
everton should be down to ten , poor decision by dowd 
wow this merseyside derby really is living up to the billing .
liverpool fans saying red card ! most others saying booking and a talking to . what do you think ? 
lucky there everton . dont know what the physio was doing though . always got to be something
if i was a liverpool fan i would be going fucking mental
everton are dirty pricks
everton should be down to ten men shocking tackle on suarez !
oh my t_t 
why is nobody tweeting about the everton liverpool match
total bull shit mirrales clearly tryed to take suarez out the game sould have been red 
wise move putting helen flanagan in the liverpool lineup , she's quality up front but i think she'll get penetrated to easily at the back
suarez back in the field . everton vs liverpool
should have went home straight after dinner to watch merseyside derby , instead of looking at computers which i will never buy
liverpool will take suarez off when he's dead , nothing less lol .
on the plus side that tackle will probably endear miralles to the everton fans more than the goal 
liverpool physio advising the referee . should keep his cherry out . everton still in this game . barkley , the best player on the pitch so far .
decent game at everton ...
everton fans though ... mirallas should have been off !
liverpool doctor said something to the ref when suarez was down , scum
yellow card ? referee doesn't have a clue ! 
i fuckin love mirallas you scouse bastard , next time fucking kill him !! 
how was that not a red ? everton lucky ...
let's get the dogs of war going come on everton
getting a bit feisty in merseyside . even the physio's getting involved !
oh well an injured suarez is still better than any blue shit everton can produce
what is the score of liverpool v everton
wow , we got fucked over in the derby . normally it's everton getting screwed over !
just got my first uni offer off liverpool john moores ! eeeee
i hope i don‚Äôt miss my flight to liverpool ..
liverpool n everton playin right now 2-1
lucky liverpool . no way should everton be behind . 3 for big rom would be so sweet .
that's a horrid tackle by miralles but what the hell is the liverpool physio doing talking to the ref .
liverpool physio having a word with the referee . sit down and do your job you clown ! 
liverpool !!!
it'd be fantastic if everton somehow managed to pull off a draw !
watching the derby in barclays bank in liverpool 
everton you dirty fucks .. trying to take out suarez like that . fuck outta here ..
did the liverpool physio come onto the pitch before the ref decided , and say to the ref we watched the tackle on replay and it's a red ? üòØ
everton are playing too dirty and targeting one man √°rez
red card ? where is it ? dirty everton .
liverpool 2-1 everton
kevin mirallas , 's man with the greatest source of goal threat , should have been red-carded .
no need for that ! typical everton !
whats the score for merseyside derby now guys
completely forgot the merseyside derby was today . managers made in swansea eh ?
everton should be able draw / win this game now .
fucking atkinson there having a right good giggle with the everton bench . can't stand that twat either .

at least with everton v liverpool being on , everyone has stopped watching this embarassment !
liverpool fielding flanagan & allen . one for the oldsters . 
everton will win the war today . believe !
liverpool fielding a good number of very ugly chaps
seems everton's master plan to stop suarez is just to kick him until he goes off . 
score again suarez and dive right in front of the everton fans please ?
miralles the biggest cunt in the world that was a straight red .. send that bitch off

liverpool , wha'? 
pathetic everton fans , booing suarez for dirty play by their own team .
luis suarez is the only reason why liverpool are in the top half of the table 
besides fabio borini and andy caroll liverpool seem to have a talent of sniffing out world class strikers
tasty as usual on merseyside . barkley booked for diving , mirallas lucky to still be on field after lunge at suarez , liverpool lead 2-1 .

everton vs liverpool is a mad game at the moment
liverpool still leading 2-1

everton probably has the loudest ground in the league when it comes to whinging for referee decisions .
i think everton today come here play rugby one 
ref needs to sort the everton players out . purposely trying to injure suarez 
i am not a liverpool or a suarez fan but mirallas deserved a red for that horrible tackle on suarez . everton are very lucky ...

i bet stuart broad goes for liverpool . 
liverpool's bench is too black .

im continuously told by liverpool mate that ' suarez to arsenal is a backward step , but if you sign a top striker you'll win the league '.....
liverpool commentators at work ... when its gerrard's elbow it's " leverage for going for the header ?"

missed the first half of the everton game after a 14 hour sleep 
lukakus been pretty shit since he scored in those first couple of games when he signed for everton
they've conceded , but liverpool are defending excellently under continued pressure . the 4-4-2 looks much more solid .
and my phone has been dead for ages , so i'm sat here watching the liverpool vs everton game
lol love how everton feel the need to take out suarez üòÇ
lukako is a class b striker ! 
we can loan fellaini to everton for the second half
lucas has been liverpool's best player this first half
bucket list : fly to liverpool to watch a merseyside derby

twitter is calm . current wtf level is mostly polite . current rate : 3.45 % trending : , happy , liverpool , great , suarez , stupid
michael owen can't be any more biased towards liverpool in this match . " that's why he is in the liverpool team ."
oh how i loooove merseyside derbies ! come on you reds !
as much as i don't like liverpool , you cannot fault suarez's footballing abilities , what a player
after the goals , merseyside derby turning into the usual slug-fest , with crunching tackles and fraying tempers aplenty . 
merseyside derby : where blood is shed and the morals don't matter
everton getting frustated ..
why do everton think their so bad ? sakho and skrtel will eat them alive
only thing missing from everton's moyes style tactics is felliani's elbows 
imagine the merseyside derby when gerard retires üòï
everytime i see luis suarez playing in red , i imagine it to be arsenal red than liverpool red .
i remember the day we signed the good brazillian in anderson and liverpool signed the shit one in lucas . how times have changed ...
everton : 3 horror tackles this season . 0 red cards
derby panas everton vs liverpool
everton guilty of over elaborating at times . should hit those first time passes more often .
45 ' everton 1-2 liverpool - derby day providing lots of drama thus far , and tempers flaring up .

can't believe the liverpool game is on bt sport , forced to watch the bloody hibs game 
everton v liverpool , arsenal v southampton & b . dortmund v bayern munich , not a bad saturday of sport
lucas apparates , knicks the ball , and defuses everton's attack . 
another merseyside memory for luis suarez !

need to shut the door on everton . another goal will put us in an epic position
remember when liverpool tried to offload xabi alonso to make-weight gareth barry ?

and d merseyside derby is on point .

glen johnson , the liverpool no . 2 , has returned from injury . he is currently out of position 
apparently my son ( evertonian ) says i can't rub it in but liverpool are beating them 2 - 1 :-)
i , being the complete plum that i am decided to miss the merseyside derby and go to town .
i don't have bt sport so it's sheffield wednesday vs huddersfield for me , instead of the merseyside derby
it would have been easier to buy suarez in august than now ... liverpool will do anything to keep him now

goodjob liverpool , gogo bikin lagi liverpool !!
proper merseyside derby heated üî•
everyone on the planet ( accept uruguay , the red half of liverpool and north wales ) were hoping for a worst tackle . mirallas on suarez !

watching everton vs liverpool now .
anyone got a stream for the merseyside derby ?
reckon that will be a red card in this merseyside derby ..
liverpool vs everton the score is still eve 1 liv 2
johnson's over confidence in the ball may cost liverpool third time he's been dispossessed
liverpool would be nothing without lucas , so under rated !
suarez's free kick home to become the top scorer in the primier league " awesome for liverpool "
everton 1 - 2 liverpool . 1st half . goodison park .
love a good merseyside derby ‚öΩÔ∏èüëä
liverpool are pretty lucky to have a proper brazilian in the squad . not like manutd . inconsistent brazilian schmuck
shame they cut away from that replay . i really wanted to see what slur that everton fan in the lower left was going to yell .
lucas has been brilliant for liverpool so far ... 
if i was suarez , i'd take a 2 match ban and just tell all the everton fans where to go .
everton vs liverpool 
glad too see so many of you upset that miralles didn't get sent off . some don't care because they want liverpool to lose .
everton fans boo suarez because he's got more talent in his right root than their whole team .
does graham think he's playing in the liverpool derby ??? 2013
a draw would be ideal , cmon everton grab a leveller !
still remember when liverpool fans hated lucas and wanted him out . now they love him . 
come on everton
when liverpool play the atmosphere in my house is crazyüò≠

liverpool haven't had much of the ball . they have marshalled lukaku well whilst suarez playing as a false 9
how has dowd over-ruled the linesman there ? dowd was miles away , clearly a liverpool throw .
liverpool dealt very well so far with lukaku , especially lucas . but ... 
love me or hate me , my passion for liverpool will never die
come on liverpool

now lukaku in everton .. but he good sia lol mourinho
it's time to liverpool ! 
1 more goal boys !!!!!!!

lucas leiva is one of liverpool's best players like , so underrated .
liverpool are a tad bit more incisive and seem to know how to make the most of their possession , whereas everton don't .
if liverpool win they'll go top of the premier league - king b
the merseyside derby never disappoints 
liverpool gotta hold it down

have liverpool created a single chance ?

lino gave a l'pool free kick , ref gave it to everton . was clearly neither , just shoulder-to-shoulder .

it still makes me happy going on liverpool fc's official twitter account and seeing that they follow me ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòç
everton have lost the plot of the play . what's wrong with lukaku , dude runs with robocop
say what you like but it's about time everton got some luck in a derby

loan report : lukaku has been awfully isolated up front for everton v liverpool today , but he's also been slow to react to anything .
just realized i'm that pissed the merseyside derby is on but i can't get up and therefor i've watched 58mins of sheffield w huddersfield
come on everton ! 
serious question is there more hateful fans in the world than at everton ! have you seen the faces every time an lfc player goes near ?
extra midfielder for liverpool forcing everton to play direct into lukaku more than usual . don't mind it , led to some decent chances .
lolol i've already lost followers for all my everton tweets this morning . üòÇüíô
liverpool beat for now

there is no creativity in central areas for 
epl game in the am üëå 
 glen johnson continues to be the liability at the back , loses possession in dangerous areas . if everton score it'll be on him
people under value the job lucas does for liverpool
the left side of everton's attack has been nullified
liverpool giving them too much space there
haha skrtel having the ball thrown at him , catches it and gives the everton fan a thumbs up
everton are cunts , liverpool are bigger cunts

half time broh , evertoon 1-2 liverpool
liverpool 2 a 1
everton fans are annoying 
dont even know any everton fans to take the piss out of hahaha
why is every everton fan so angry all i've seen throughout the match is them screaming at our players like proper mongrels 
so jokes walking around liverpool with a clipboard and everyone's dodging out of my way . gonna have to start carrying one around more often !
2-1 at halftime , any lead is a good lead . liverpool look off their game though . injuries likely playing a large part in that .
looking as if the max saints can go this weekend is 2nd :( boo 
everton will be very disappointed with the goals they have conceded . they had shown great spirit to get back into the game .
an everton player is shown a card for diving , but lets boo suarez for being hacked at the knee and continuing to play on 
hate it how all the everton players crowded dowd when gerrard tackled barry ahahahaha
it's so good having the best striker in the league playing for liverpool because he can score 25 goals and they'll still probably finish 5th
liverpool's leading , well .
amazing c'mon 
fuckin excellent half liverpool ! them scumbags should be a man down though the dirty twats
intense first half hopefully everton can pull back even
fucking hate liverpool
no matter what i always argue with a united fan on a liverpool/everton derby . 
fantastic first half from the 2 merceyside team but liverpool lead with 2-1 advantage into the break 
pienaar shouldn't have left everton to spurs in da first place ... da loss of play time did him real bad
liverpool and southampton win would be perfect today
cracking merseyside derby so far .
yes liverpool ! 2-1 ht
what pienaar was dong for that free i'll never know . crazy stuff . mirallas could have gone . still think everton can win it 
anyways , congrats to martinez & his wife on the birth of their daughter & hopefully everton will turn things around & beat liverpool 
do everton fans sing at goodison or just boo and moan ?
people that don't know liverpool will have questioned the decision to play flanagan at lb . how wrong . arguably are best player first half .

nice stats for liverpool in this first half ...
a quick first half ! come on liverpool 
everton 1 - 2 liverpool . poor defence by both teams . and mirallas should have received a red card instead of yellow .
anyone else think that tackle on suarez was deliberate . come on liverpool , we've got this . 
great battling first half . wonder free kick from suarez . everton are doing some moaning to the ref , proves they are up against it ! ynwa
i've always loved 
come on everton
beautiful first half with couple goals and real fight between this liverpool clubs . i love it 
you know the merseyside derby is getting rough when barry and liverpool's medical assistant start brawling
everton haven't half made me laugh in the last 48 mins . so so so bitter , please never change üòò
ht 1-2 - explosive first-half at goodison park , much like last season . liverpool ahead at the break though a luis suarez free-kick

mirallas is lucky to still be on the pitch !

ht| everton 1-2 lfc #3point
 guessing liverpool will be getting a call from riley then for failure to give the red card ??.. what injustice
5 ' philippe coutinho , 19 ' luis suarez score for the reds while 8 ' kevin mirallas gets everton only goal in the game ...
some liverpool fans are clueless , swear

merseyside derby ... yeahhhhh !
that suarez eh have another season at liverpool
good first half that , everton should be down to 10 men , even andy gray agrees . need a good 2nd half . 
all our first corners are hitting the front post too , i think that's intentional considering everton don't defend it . 
everton abeg make una try draw dt match oo

everton 1-2 liverpool ht . not much actual good play in all honesty despite the high tempo . suarez and lucas impressive .
imagine that was suarez doing that tackle on a everton player ? the ref bottled it and he might cost us the game

liverpool <3 <3
great first half lads , even everton is playing amazing football .. but come on you ! ! come on , i want a !

' town called malice ' now playing at h-t of everton-l'pool 
is everton player coleman twin 2 bale
2 chances 2 goals ... lucky cunts 
the first half just reminded me of how much i hate everton
every team needs a match winner . liverpool's is suarez . not too sure who our's is at the moment ...
everton lucky to still have 11 on the field . more of the same pls reds 
and quite frankly the team that looks like they need money is liverpool .. i mean :o w many top players do they have ? 3
merseyside is red not blue
so liverpool won't take off a clearly injured suarez . typical .
merseyside derbies and liverpool v man unuted are the best games to watch
what was the liverpool physio doing ? why was he making snide remarks in the refs ear when he was on the pitch to treat his player ? 
premier league half time : everton 1-2 liverpool
the hilarious thing is that everton's goal should never have been because it wasn't even a free kick in the first place , lucas won the ball
streaming liverpool lancar
what else would you expect from the 221st merseyside derby ? helluva 1st half . 
on a more positive note , liverpool is leading and looking pretty decent . suarez needs more protection though .

oii this derby is so tense lfc 2-1 everton

man said come football , does he know who liverpool are ??
everton need to beat liverpool today it's a must
suarez is a fantastic footballer but everyone but liverpool fans like that tackle . the amount he rolls around , all least he got a reason .
liverpool fans secretly loving that mirallas tackle . suarez the victim . as always ...
phew ! i can now breath . lead 1-2 at the half against everton !
nice to see a ref not going over the top an letting the game flow like the old days ! 
everton needs to do a better job stopping liverpool's midfield presence .
would like to see us press everton higher
merseyside is reds broooo ! 
the scores at half time are : everton 1-2 liverpool . coutinho opening the scoring and mirallas equalizing before suarez scored the second .
half-time everton 1-2 liverpool . goals from coutinho and suarez

final del pt everton 1 liverpool 2 1080
i'm sure liverpool have another goal coming
2-1 half time ! good half liverpool 
liverpool matched at a high of 4.2 to be leading at half-time . next goal : 2.3 , 2.66 , no goal 4.8 . over 4.5 goals is 2.12 .
everton playing quite rough . mirallas should have been red carded
come on everton you can win this match
liverpool don't deserve a player of suarez's quality .
merseyside derby has been very entertaining thus far
are you jas all i see by trends is this liverpool kak :/
looking good at half-time liverpool ! keep it up ! ‚ù§Ô∏è
ain't gonna lie this merseyside derby is raw
buzzing for the game , need everton to do us a massive favour tonight though !
the is joke in the everton v liverpool mach everton should be down 2 10 men grow a set ball 
lucas solid as a rock ! everton most be playing with 10 men
how can miralles knee high challenge on suarez not be a red . once again offcials taking the piss out of suarez . come on liverpool . 2-1 htime

everton ladies .... start your engines ..

how everton are not down to ten men i don't know ! disgusting tackle !
c'mon everton ! pls win
the merseyside derby has made a significant play to be the opening game on 
the commentators don't need to point out that the everton fans are booing suarez , everyone boos suarez .
2-1 liverpool ht good half by the lads ref bottled the red card for sure like the shithouse he is half way to 3 massive points
nothing poorer than everton on derby day .
everton should be down to 10 men , it's turned scrappy and courtino has been quiet apart from his goal . no arguments about goals/chances 
joe allen = liverpool's tom cleverley
half time ~ liverpool lead merseyside derby .. come on reds
ross barkley can hurt liverpool . his first half performance was good . fuck him and fuck everton
everton 1-2 liverpool c'mon liverpool !!
brilliant first half ! come on everton !
no matter how well we're doing in the league , we never ever seem to win on derby day 
decent half . well organised when everton have the ball but giving them far too much time on the ball in my opinion . gerrard sloppy .
sky sports are lying bastards ! told me liverpool was winning 2-1 now it says 1-0 liverpool what's going on here
same old everton getting away with it , red card all day
if i knew the liverpool game was in bt sport
good half liverpool
hope everton win's
halftime and its still liverpool leading 2-1 at the godison park ... stay tuned for the second half
liverpool should lose this match oh
ht liverpool game !
ht everton 1 -2 liverpool
a liverpool win would be a nice early birthday present :)
everton are very very very lucky to have mirallas remain on the pitch . kmt ; -_-
yes liverpool !! exactly what i wanted to come back to üòÑ
jaime bien les supporters de liverpool
conflicted , wanting both sides to win . :p 
good game the merseyside derby . it's what we lack at villa , a competitive meaningful derby . such a shame 
beyond a shadow of doubt , everton should be playing with 10 men .
everton should have been down to 10 !! 
ht everton 1-2 liverpool ( coutinho x1 , suarez x1 ) 
motherfucking everton playing dirty like shit
flanagan and allen will be doing the ht entertainment at the merseyside derby . 
merseyside is reds because blue is a film 
good scoreline if not a great performance from liverpool . giving possession away too much and too easily . can't rely on set pieces .
gonna miss the second half of the merseyside derby and the first half of bayern munchen vs borussia dortmund because of work
who's the bellend that decided it would be a good idea to put the england v new zealand game on at the same time as the merseyside derby ?! üòí
bien liverpool !
half time liverpool 2-1 everton
good half but everton need to step it up liverpool can win this !
would love to be at that match , merseyside derby is definitely the best atmosphere i ever experienced in my life
all everton's dominance has to pay off in the second half
heck yeah ! liverpool up at the half 
1st half liverpool 2-1 everton :) go go liverpool :))
everton should be down to 10 men
come on everton !
ht at everton v liverpool . no red cards , but should there have been with the mirallas tackle on suarez ? what do you's think ? 
both merseyside playing so well at the first half . but liverpool will prove that merseyside is red , not blue . 
1st bloody to liverpool ... bring on 2nd half !!! 
living in a uni flat full of boys for the weekend whilst the everton vs liverpool game is on .... kill me nowüòØüî´
i blame me dad for raising me up and making me watch and go to the liverpool gamesüòÇ
halftime everton 1 liverpool 2 
today is a good day of football ... after lfc vs everton still have arsenal vs southampton =)
entertaining first half , what a free kick by suarez ! everton should be down to 10 men but hey ho bad decisions are a part of the game now !
and guess what everton , sturridge is still waiting for you 
how are there bare everton fans complaining about gerrard then saying nothing when mirallas makes the dirtiest challenge
ht : everton 1 - 2 liverpool goal by mirallas - coutinho and suarez 
knew from the moment everton got gareth barry that he'd be a nightmare in the derby . nasty bugger with absolute zero class .
if there's any decent liverpool fans out there ud tell the truth and say use do not deserve to b winning this game !!!
everton . liverpool . 3 goals off set pieces . a should-have-been red card that was called yellow on a foreign player ? most english game ever .
set pieces and suarez stands between everton and victory - two defensive errors cost us in 1st half . 
missed the 1st half due to traffic . we are winning but i heard has been taking a kicking 
yall were shouting sign fellaini ... then baines ??? nw barkley ... make dem kuku change everton to manchester united b then ...
" merseyside is red , not blue " 
half-time : everton 1-2 liverpool come on liverpool 
just seen ' the tackle ' in the merseyside derby .. surely retrospective punishment has to be taken ? ridiculous challenge
well done liverpool .
very entertaining first half . hoping that liverpool can manage a win and not forget to show up in the second half .
yess liverpool winning 2-1 !!
3 goals - 1 from suarez - an everton player diving & another with a knee-high foul . so a normal mersey derby 1st half then 
everton still got this .
come on liverpool keep it up in the 2nd half :) ! n
ht : everton 1-2 liverpool fc .. good play by flanagan :)
so how cold does it get in liverpool in winter ? going to be a change from our hot aussie summers in february for me
whats that everton/liverpool score ?
liverpool to see ashüòà
goodluck liverpool
everton started much brighter and should have been leading ! then they conceded 2 cheap goals .
hope liverpool destroy them 2nd halfüòÇ
wild first half with scores from coutinho and suarez . mirallas got everton's goal and should have gotten a red .
ht : everton 1-2 liverpool who is your so far ? who should be subbed ?
descanso everton 1-2 liverpool .
everton have been done over by officials in 80% of merseyside derbys in the last decade . pipe down liverpool fans , suarez deserves a kicking
ht liverpool‚ô• 2-1 evershite , great half . should have been a red to mirallas
first half everton 1-2 liverpool
everton should be down to about 9 men here
c'mon everton . you can do it . a draw is all i'm asking for .
stat : luis suarez has scored in four of his last five games v everton . bet : 5/1 suarezt to score the first goal of the second half 
if there was a tournament made up of merseyside xi , manchester xi , london xi & tyne & wear xi , round robin style . which team wins it ?
chelsea vs westham liverpool vs everton arsenal vs southampton barcelona vs granada bayern vs dortmund real madrid vs almeria what a day !
liverpool defending well , kept lukaku out the game so far . still all to play for in the second half 
take a bow bt sport ! thoroughly enjoying the merseyside derby now and its dortmund v bayern munich later . football-tastic ! 
everton lucky to get away with it ... hope suarez is alright 
2-1 to liverpool let's go
you know i can't recall a more cynical foul than that to a liverpool player ?
match de dingue liverpool everton

everton will win this game hahaha
what does liverpool for you ? 
james mccarthy should be drawing dicks on steamed up windows on the school bus and not playing for everton
ht : everton 1-2 liverpool : goals from coutinho and suarez give liverpool a half-time lead , mirallas scores one for everton at goodison park
can't recall seeing lukaku have so little effect in a game . credit to liverpool's defence .
everton 1-2 liverpool . ynwa , good job coutinho and suarez .

what a great 1st half of the derby . it had everything in it , goals , tackles , overall great football . ht : everton 1 - 2 liverpool .
 there's too much talk on that mirallas tackle on suarez being red . aren't we tired of seeing reds in the merseyside derby ?
everton must take off mirallas before luiz suarez bite him .
everton seem to have the refs in their back pocket this year , barrys tackles a couple weeks ago and now that .
great first half in the merseyside derby ! not the best tackle by mirallas ... and howard won't want to see the free kick back i'd say .
luis suarez free kick was genius though as usual , the only to stop this guy is to injure him and everton are trying their best for sure !
everton you need to get your acted together ! and fast !
are liverpool and arsenal making a come back this year ? wow
merseyside is reds ! the famous reds !!

for a team that hadn't conceded a goal for 5 and a half hours everton will be disappointed with those two .
what an amazing start to the day ... liverpool winning ( so far ) and class cancelled !! :d
sergi canos got his first goal for liverpool in the 2-0 win this morning . alex o'hanlon the other scorer .
everton should have finished that half with 10 men , instead they finish it with 12

5 ' philippe coutinho , 19 ' luis suarez score for liverpool while 8 ' kevin mirallas gets everton only goal in the game ...
everton need to get lukaku more involved , just lumping it up to him isn't gonna do anything .
as squads stand ; title challengers : chelsea and city - 3rd place : utd/arsenal - 4th place : utd , arsenal , spurs , liverpool .

everton being outplayed by the mighty reds so have to resort to kicking . 
liverpool
halftime score is liverpool 2 everton 1 , so far so good but a whole nx half 2 go , i think we need another goal ynwa
suarez's hold up play has been pretty brilliant today , relentlessly harrying and frustrating everton's defence . 
everton should be down to 10 men idec
an excellent first halves from henderson & flanagan in nullifying everton's dangerous flanks . su√°rez epitomising willpower as per ."
hey liverpool let's exchange . give us coutinho we'll give you willian .
epl is back and merseyside is red
c'mon liverpool !! 
only supporters of a certain age will appreciate how good a young charlie nicholas was . it was a big mistake choosing arsenal over liverpool
merseyside is red
think everton should be down to 10 men too ..
having trouble getting here today ? we're a 10min walk from liverpool street or moorgate . or catch the 35 , 55 or 243 bus ! don't give up !
good half that liverpool keep it going 
liverpool playing ? thought the pubs round preston were busier than normal 
wahhh so many liverpool supporters . . _ .
to be honest , everton were the better team .

halftime at everton . liverpool leads by a goal .
2-1 liverpool !!! amazing goal by suarez !! 
ht : liverpool 2-1 everton :) wooow come on liverpool you are half way there . thete is no game like a liverpool darby . 
i love how bt sport have managed to squeeze in the saints game between everton v liverpool and bayern v dortmund 
possession got better as the half went on . but everton create more half chances . we ahead coz suarez has had a better game than lukaku .
why should liverpool ? why not others ? 
yaay !! liverpool winning ..
liverpool Óêô
gerard is the heartbeat of liverpool , coutinho intelligent , lucas is priceless and suarez magic
someone got booked for diving didn't they everton
_ first half ; | everton 1:2 liverpool .. 'll_never_walk_alone
torres isnt good now . he cant be the same as he was in liverpool . eto'o is old alr demba ba isnt good also . he was better in newcastle
looks like everton could get a red in the next half
come on everton 
how everton still have 10 men is disgraceful . so jose , can liverpool expect a refereeing apology sometime after the game ? 
what a pulsating firsthalf to the merseyside derby . common reds
gutted to be missing the merseyside derby . on the other hand tho just landed in miami , nice
everton must nt lose oo
we lead at ht 2-1 , i just love beating everton !!!! great atmosphere too 
top everton fan !!!!!!!!
for everton , a player in the hole would allow some space for lukaku to deal with . taking him off won't bring much good to their play .
come on everton ! 
everton - liverpool possession 55% : 45% attempts 5:3 passing 218:180 on target 2:2 off target 3:0
only thing missing right now is that sexy girlfriend who goes for liverpool and will watch these games with me ...
otherwise it's been what i expected . everton having more of the ball , but us having far more incisiveness . flanno defending well .
any pics of the liverpool and everton fans sitting together ?
and as it looks , suarez is the only key liverpool have to securing champs league football next season ...
come on everton
everton still got dis üôè
go on liverpool !!!
there's nothing that fires me up like these merseyside derbies
everton has to win dis match
half time : liverpool - 2 everton - 1

good to see carragher has left the refereeing of the game in safe hands with the liverpool physio . although not the influence clearly
whats all this going on twitter n facebook asuming all liverpool fans using wots the meaning you never wank alone
so , victor moses was fed up being a chelsea substitute , so goes on loan to liverpool to be one of their substitutes . and the logic is ....?

some liverpool fans have started to whin like a girl . fuck la this is football ...
soccer time ... liverpool fc on point !!! 2-1

rustic half from everton ! literally gave the ball back to the reds most of the time , ross barkley is the only player looked good on the field
liverpool vs everton prediction 3-2 to the scousers and the shoulder muncher saurez
good 1st half by liverpool . need more strength up front . sturridge could help . and flanagan can be quite struggling but hes fine .

trying to watch the merseyside derby , but this thai commentary is unbearable . they are just constantly screaming ! 
liverpool tonightüòâ
liverpool must draw ..
that was a crazy first half . feel like deulofeu could come on in 2nd half and open up that liverpool defense some more . 
// what's the liverpool score ?
ht everton 1-2 liverpool in the early premier league game ( tb ) 
everton surpporters r scum spiting at suarez
liverpool i think got there tactics spot on . coutinho , suarez n henderson have pressed the everton defence forcing fouls which has led goals
liverpool leading 2-1 yesahhhh !!!
the merseyside derby is living up to the billing . interesting 1st half . lukaku to level up the score in the 2nd half :p
good 1st half to watch 2-1 to liverpool hopefully we can finish what we've started in the 2nd half
liverpool's home kit is the best gift i can wiwh for
everton's starters include a common lookalike in goal , a mr bean lookalike and a guy who‚Äôs name sounds like freaky asian fetish porn . 
if carlsberg did saturday's . merseyside derby . hunger games film then doctor who on bbc 
ah shit i've missed the first half of liverpool everton
should liverpool play attacking football and kill the game or play it safely and protect the lead ?
liverpool everton trending

at everton vrs lvpool here's flamezzz
wtf is everton playing ..
in past merseyside derbies i've seen players sent off for a lot less than that mirallas foul on suarez
being taunted by liverpool fans at the pub . still think there's a few more goals to come though ! come on everton !
why did the physio get entangled with everton players ?
steady liverpool steady
cracking first half , everton should definitely be down to 10 men tho
so it's half-time in the and are beating 2-1 . who do you want to win ? 
why is anyone watching the rugby when everton v liverpool is on ?! 
liverpool 
come on skrtel please , please , please score for me ! 
jamie carragher was an evertonian as a boy and now claims to be liverpool to the core . what a wanker
that everton wall resembled the wall by the train station in borth 
boy does steven gerrard make it impossible to like him . it's not just that hideous liverpool shirt on him but the whole scouse swagger he has
i loved the reaction from the liverpool physio after that bad tackle , i thought the ref was going to book him haha
why the fuck are everton fans booing suarez ? he didn't just stud himself in the knee , you fucking idiots .
 1-2 1st half .... come on 
if only liverpool had accepted arsenal's bid of ¬£40m + ¬£1 ...
it's mental how everton and liverpool fans sit wae each other at the games
first half . dowd is a shithouse , spot on with flanno , lukaku is stuck in aggers pocket , everton have flapped it
not sure how much suarez actually loves liverpool after his summer antics . if he does indeed want to stay , liverpool must be flying in jan .
everton trail in the merseyside derby 1-2 ...
all everton do is foul and hoof , fucking let's put these pricks back in the lane this half , no messing about !!! 
cracking first half . barkley looks a class player . liverpool look shaky in defence need to improve in that area to be title contenders
 half time : everton 1-2 liverpool
c'mon everton ... don't screw this chance make us 5 pts clear of liverpool .
i guess everton is slowing down
can't wait for liverpool to make an absolute meal out of this second half
don't let us down everton .
everton vs liverpool 1-2 . 19 ' luis suarez scores for liverpool ! what a genius ! 
everton can overturn this , whi knows
enthralling first half at goodison . everton behind but have shown promise , ross barkley has been impressive . 
everton definitely showed that they will probably get another . we have to score one more - sturridge to get the winner ?
liverpool to be winning at half time were 11/5 , absolute massive price !! should of bet on it's own instead of putting in a acc !!
playing shite and 2-1 up .. were all laughing at everton ha ha ha
not much else to say other than good first half for liverpool . 
screw the merseyside derby . it's all about dortmund vs bayern !
shoulda been a red . can't really blame dowd for that though . suarez's reputation is why the everton man hadn't been sent off 
come on everton
come on everton ! just for my bet !!
hahahaha defensive wall hahaha everton frustrated hahaha pretend dowd did nothing wrong
everton so lucky to still have 11 players on the pitch !
everton's intensity in the opening 15 minutes or so was unreal . very impressed by barkley but mirallas lucky to still be on the field
everton need to get back into this game in the 2nd half !
liverpool must've had three chances that half and scored two of them
watching everton v liverpool . and wondering if died should have gone red on mirales
please county the number of liverpool fans in your area code and give us the answer ?
up liverpool
right blues 2nd half we need to come out fighting and try to get another goal and try not let liverpool score come on blues
everton should be a man down ! disgusting foul on suarez !
step it up everton
a very pulsating and entertaining first half ; everton are the side doing the playing and liverpool doing the scoring ; 
1-2 , merseyside red take a lead in first half . keep it reds !
liverpool should have a man adventige after mirallas tackle suarez .
everton don't let me down
got to be honest . i'm seething at liverpool's start to the season . tanking out of europe last season a huge example
suarex will leave liverpool by january !
my father is walking around the house whispering to himself " liverpool cmon cmon cmon liverpool "
merseyside derby : everton ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) liverpool . merseyside is red !!!
them everton birds that go the match don't half pull some mad kites don't they , fucking munters
fernando torres was brilliant during his peak at liverpool , but su√°rez is miles better
the guy to ref these games should be dean . not bothered he's from merseyside he's a tranmere fan , he'd be fair i reckon
it's a pretty even game tbh , perhaps everton with the edge but they're the home team so that's to be expected .
 v ‚Äì philippe coutinho boosted from 8/1 to 16/1as he scored 1st within the opening 20 minutes 
liverpool derby is as tense , as my cheeks after a curry . !
2-1 , let's get another one in this half liverpool
 liverpool vs everton
liverpool's home kit is the best gift i can wish for
man it's gonna be so sad for liverpool fans when suarez goes to madrid in jan .
everton can overturn this , who knows
how does everton even have a fan base ?
how everton still have 11 men is disgraceful . so jose , can liverpool expect a refereeing apology sometime after the game ? 
liverpool have scores 2 ..
 everton - liverpool le derby de la mersey
liverpool looking more threatening than everton , might see a change at half time as everton need another attacking player .
if liverpool wins ... too much pressure on arsenal ... no ! no ! no ! no ! no !
hi what channel is liverpool playin ?
holy .. this merseyside derby .
come on everton
actually the everton's goal scored by mirallas was offside . 
decent first half that , slowing the game down defo plays into our hands . flanagan looking good aswell 
good half for us ! can't believe that dirty everton scumbag didn't get sent off though
not like brendan rogers team to lose possession . everton is a lot better at keeping the ball this year tho
satnight nobar liverpool :d
moyes dont buy anyone from everton , i mean baines is like 29 and we dont need barkley just yet maybe in the future
think everton have been the better team . threatening from open play , quick on the counter . can't afford to slack in the 2nd half . 
everton have averaged the most possession in the league this season . results don't matter to everton fans now a days i guess .
the more i watch that tackle , the more i wonder if paul scholes is coaching at everton now or something .
liverpool is beyond ahead from everton ? wohooo to liverpool fans
everton superior but it's the goals that win games . liverpool only really look threatening from set pieces .
following the merseyside derby game from everton 1 - 2 liverpool . we need a win
decent merseyside derby so far
merseyside : 3 goals from standards , which all could have been defended better . mirallas should have seen red for his foul on suarez .
i enjoyed that first half of the scouse derby . liverpool- united's biggest rival/game of the season . still makes me piss , that does !
stevie g to score next and liverpool to win 3.1 66/1 ..........
do all everton fans buy there gear in st johns market ! 
merseyside is red !! 
another goal from everton , then alberto comes on in the 89th minute and scores the winner . yep , that's what's gonna happen . üíÉ
boss wen ye read r softlads tweets wen he used t ba blue till judgie got him a liverpool kit
liverpool fc ‚ù§Ô∏è
hon liverpool , top of the table , only 1 team in liverpool !!
liverpool will win this tonight !
just need to come out 2nd half and take too liverpool , just come out all guns blazing , take it to them blues !
lot of everton fans playing the man and not the ball . funny that . they know they should be down to 10 .
daniel agger ( liverpool ): barcelona contract ? was a very attractive idea , playing in barcelona is every player dream . we changed our mind
said it for years and i'll say it again , lucas leiva for liverpool is class
our football database stats - if 3 goals @ ht 0/6 0 goals to ft 3/6 2 or more 1/10 0 goals to ft 4/10 2 or more
everton want's to give my suarez injury , it woun't work
liverpool fans gass so much , they hype about the smallest thing . " look how suarez smiled as he kicked that ball , world class "
who's your favourite ever liverpool player ? steven gerrard for me
coutinho makes an early goal and suarez dominates the free kick area with a superb finish . everton 1-2 
english premier league half time everton-1 liverpool-2
i love saturdays . everton v liverpool , arsenal v southampton and then dortmund v munich all back to back today . then the froch fight later üëå

jon flanagan has been outstanding for liverpool so far !

suarez clearly missing the threat of sturridge upfront , lacking options going forward liverpool . 
liverpool fc do me proud on my bday , southampton do me proud too so we can remain 1st !!

depending on everton and southampton
very intensive game liverpool vs everton . fantastic free kick from suarez makes it 2-1
oh fcuk ! i totally forgot about liverpool everton . lucky halftime only . * phew *
liverpool playin good
wonder what the odds of 3-2 for everton would be at the minute
liverpool up 2-1 at half in the merseyside derby !! great start to the day !! 
as long as hodgson is coaching england , liverpool players shouldn't be allowed to play for them . should be stipulated in every contract .
liverpool
new zealand miss benji . and liverpool miss sturridge .
that guy nearly kills suarez and only gets a yellow ? really ? 
we're in the end of november-13 , 12th round in the premier league , and i must admit it now ; liverpool looking sharp after some edgy years
want liverpool to loose today : @
what a first half from liverpool , 2 goals through set pieces
if prefer to watch this rugby than liverpool

everton have no class
break time .. cuak second half liverpool nie
liverpool took their chances we didn't we don't deserve to be behind but we are . 
wow that tackle on suarez was rough 
cracking merseyside derby so far !
if liverpool win the merseyside derby i'll be very happy 
everton utilising diagonal ball well with lukaku isolating flanagan , but lucky to still have 11 on the pitch . next goal is massive !
we‚Äôll find it tough to defend that lead for 45 minutes . everton‚Äôs pressing will pay off sooner or later .
half-time at goodison 2-1 liverpool ! exciting 2nd half to come ! predictions ?
down liverpool pleaseeee oh lord .
come on everton , we can smash these red cunts !
everton will be happy to secure a draw from here . 
isn't it nice that the liverpool and everton fans can sit together and all get along nicely 
dad why have you put liverpool on and your not even watching it your asleep üòêüò°
genuinely think the liverpool physio trying to advise an uncertain dowd meant he would never give the red . hubris gets you in the end .
a must win game 4 liverpool ..... nd we will
liverpool have scored just five goals in the second half of their previous 11 pl games this season , conceding seven . 
christmas lights today and german market tomorrow then back to liverpool !! üòäüòä
merseyside is red !! 
everton vs liverpool 
half time everton 1 vs 2 liverpool ...
ellies refusing to watch the liverpool game hahahah
i respect all liverpool fans . they represent loyalty
liverpool vs everton . nice free kick from luis suarez .
man . i really hope suarez doesn't come out in 2nd half liverpool/liverpoop
frustrating . been the better team but fair to liverpool they've just took their chances . not over yet though
liverpool means business this season .
the only manager to defeat everton at goodison park in 2013 was roberto martinez 
supper at porkies cause there's liverpool football here
sape sape bg link game liverpool please
go on the pool there's only one team on merseyside 
england wining in the rugby and liverpool beating everton . i'll have a happy boyfriend if this holds up
outstanding half from lucas . skrtel & agger have coped admirably with lukaku too . slowly wrestled control after a strong everton opening .
kevin mirallas equalised for everton but what did people make of his tackle on luis suarez ? 
the commentators on my stream are supporting liverpool , the cunts
i was planning to do so much work today but then the merseyside derby , arsenal and doctor who üòÅüòÅ
everton vs liverpool 1-2 # half time
what was everton's defending for the first goal though .
come on liverpool .... win this match tonight ..
dale liverpool 
great first half ! come on liverpool ! <3
it's a gamble to put flanagan on left side .. easy for everton to exploit him 
everton taking the " break a leg " motto quite literally
thanks emily i just want to clear it up that i am a liverpool fan
everton v liverpool on canal+ tv channel here . prog title : " match of ze day ". i kid you not .
step up 3 mbc max , but liverpool vs everton is live
that lad who celebrates a liverpool goal then goes straight on skype in the xbox advert . awful that . absolutely awful .

exciting go liverpool ! <3

jonathan williams ( crystal palace) , hope ( everton) , dembele ( fulham) , clark ( hull city) , jordan rossiter ( liverpool) , marcos lopes ( city )
forget liverpool this game of rugby üòç
keep it up liverpool ! 
steven gerrard hasn't had the greatest half ever , i expect more from him in the 2nd half ! 
pepe reina and robbie keane ruined liverpool in the 08/09 season they would av won the league then
liverpool can't afford to sub suarez . as good as sturridge has been this season , he's no suarez . 
half time merseyside derby : blues 1-2 reds
soo far liverpool and everton game has been really enjoyable
suarez wont come out for the second half and liverpool will either draw or lose !!
typical . i decide that i've wasted too much time watching crap merseyside derbies so don't bother today , and it sounds like a cracker .
premier league half time : everton 1 liverpool 2
come on everton ! i believe in you 
well in liverpool just another 45 to go
liverpool is not complete without suarez ..
everton losing against liverpool . lol
game on everton 1 vs 2 liverpool ...

wacthin ' liverpool vs everton with abah , big bro n cousin ;d yeay !
simply class . u can tell why the everton fans are booing him ... ... cos he is too good
" ate days a week cafe ", " sgt . pepper's bistro " - liverpool is brilliant
i think everton were better team than liverpool in first half .. liverpool riding on suarez's brilliance ..
80% of everton fans are just ugly !! an i mean personalities on the game , fucking blinded by shite !!
an injured suarez is still better than the entire everton side though
if that mirallas foul had been on any other liverpool player it would have been a red . suarez's reputation had a big part to play there .
we can't be friends if you like everton .
everton's intensity in the opening 15 minutes or so was unreal . very impressed by barkley but mirallas lucky to still be on the field
merseyside red vs merseyside blue .
liverpool should score another before johnson and gerrard gift everton a couple .
come on everton
amazing merseyside derby so far . superb suarez free kick . mirallas should not be on the pitch though . time for ale !
half time .. !
luis suarez has scored 21 goals in his last 21 liverpool appearances .
switched england on whilst everton n liverpools half time
everton scoring again is inevitable , need another first asap
miralles should be praised for clattering that shitbag 
come on everton !
 who cares ? they're all annoying & anyway ! on the other hand come on ‚öΩÔ∏è
need everton and saints to do me a favour

i'd have more respect for everton fans if they just admitted mirallas should've been off . not saying " it's on suarez so it's okay "
liverpool = rt everton = fav -carter

liverpool top of the league ... let that sink in 
he's done it against man city now everton 
today is a liverpool day . but oops i already said smth about manchester 
deffo should have been a red for mirallas , but the liverpool physio is a gobshite and has no business stirring the shit on the pitch .
martinez mouthing off to the press and then liverpool going out and doing this is brilliant ! if it stays this way i'll be a happy man
big second half come on liverpool !!!
suarez and coutinho you amazing lads 2-1 to liverpool
dat beard on the everton goalkeeper is just ... distracting

absolutely dirty tackle on suarez , should have been a send off liverpool showing strong midfield play , lead by 1 
liverpool <3
liverpool had a plan for lukaku and its working sadly
missed the 1st half of the merseyside derby .. in time for the 2nd ..
just a notice for some la liga fans : this merseyside derby is better that el classico . and i'm a chelsea who's saying it . 
terrible defending from gerrard for the everton goal . not surprised . has anybody seen him in the 1st half ? 
i'm unsure how any night out can be better than last night . that was ridiculous . liverpool was kind to us .
liverpool 2-1 everton

half time , everton 1 vs liverpool 2 .. what a game
everton vs liverpool . 1-2 . at half time . the player that fouled suarez should have been given a red card .
decentish half . made it difficult for everton to penetrate & all the wide players putting in a good shift to prevent balls coming in .
big first half 
 1 - 2 at half time at goodison . reds good value for the lead , everton should be down to 10 men for a shocking challenge .
okay back to liverpool match :-)
phil dowd is normally a great ref , but man did blow that call on mirallas . red card all the way . everton gifted . liverpool & suarez robbed .

crazy half . thought everton were better side in opening 20mins then we took control of things . dowd is a fat shithouse tho
merseyside derby , return of the jedi and froch v groves . great day of tv !
liverpool fans are fucking annoying

robbie earle is a pundit on my link for the liverpool game . didn't know he was still around , jesus .
liverpool vs everton . both shows a quality game .

its a good first half for liverpool . lets hope we can keep the ball more on the second half 
i really want liverpool to win üôè
liverpool mode on
first half of vs was incredible ! free kick was unreal . 
liverpool needs to beat everton by 3-1 to retain in 2nd position in league table . 
liverpool really playing at a high standard right now .. if i ever is to stop support arsenal that would be my next team
that liverpool set piece was beautiful
how is that not a red card ? 
brendan rodgers liverpool we're on our way to glory
liverpool 2-1 everton
liverpool
everton are just freaking foulers . they should've gotten a red card . they are purposely trying to hurt luis su√°rez .
enjoy being top of the table whilst it lasts liverpool fans üòí

warnock analysing liverpool for bt sport - now there's irony ....

stay 2-1 stay 2-1 !!! 
come on liverpool you never walk alone :)
my dad is en route to liverpool with mel & linds because he's taking them to a show and he put direct hits on in the car and phoned me .
every ' merseyside derby ' is always hot and there is always a story about referee .
hey everton mind the gap . accuracy from suarez . wow . üëå
oh what i'd give to be in the everton end now in me liverpool shirt what a day that was
good first half of footie , both teams seeming to be very solid . wouldn't be surprised if everton get a goal back , it's anyone's game ! 
need liverpool and everton to draw 
liverpool leading
maybe what we need to win the league again , with a new manager and all , is not to play in europe next season . like liverpool right now . 
everton is very lucky to still have 11 men at field .
made a very serious bet so everton need to get their act together
mirallas better thank his lucky stars . everton should be down to 10 men . dowd knows that call was bs .
firsthalf liverpool 2 - everton 1
liverpool leading by 1 ..... lfc-everton 2-1
come on liverpool ... let's do this ! 1 more half plus some more goals would be nice :)
l'pool have been lucky so far possession has been all everton suarez wants shooting the ugly buck tooth bastard .
come on everton
liverpool will be top of the league tomorrow night .
first experience watching a stream with high definition and no lag . tasman family thanks u . merseyside derby time . 
would suarez have stayed on the pitch for a similar tackle on an everton player ? somehow i doubt it 
hahahahahahahaha thank fuck i chose to watch merseyside derby lets all concentrate on united now 
great tackle kev , if you'd of done it in july liverpool fans would of agreed whilst burning his shirt üëçüòÇ 
... again , last season his game winning goal was wrongly given offside and now this and moyes said everton never get a decisions at anfield
what a cracking first half ! well done liverpool 
come on everton , at least a draw . 
if suarez had made that tackle he would have been red carded and suspended for 3 games . everton got over on that one . 
don't support liverpool , but suarez without a doubt is an incredible player and intelligent indeed .
 : suarez has now scored on all three of his trips to goodison park with liverpool
everton still in the game thanks to dowd really . a red woulda killed it .
bt sport has some budget laa haha better training equipment than everton have by the looks of it ! haha 
everton should be playing with 10 men thanks to a criminal tackle from mirallas to suarez . that would've been a red if it weren't suarez .
everton should be down to 10 , they look so dangerous with ross barkley though what a player he's going to be !!
og liverpool er best‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
come on everton
amazing first half . liverpool winning at the moment . hope it stays that way . 
merseyside blue try to beat liverpool player lke kungfu hostile haha lolx

liverpool winning through set pieces . haven't done much in open play . lets see how the 2nd half drop off factors in .
only a couple of hours ago that a small selection of liverpool fans were praising gerrards challenge on naysmith and kuyt's on neville .
in all seriousness though how he is still on the pitch i don't know . definite red card . 
liverpool have scored just five goals in the second half of their previous 11 pl games this season , conceding seven .
sergi canos got his first goal for liverpool in the 2-0 win this morning
 wonder what the liverpool fans reaction would have been if it was the other way round .... oh . lets look back to last season ...
everton's defence is vey poor today
look at how gerrard lost mirallas for the everton goal . fucking gormless twat .
everton 1 - 2 liberpool
missing the second half for a track workout . it's only the merseyside derby , what else could happen , right ? yes , i'm booing myself . 
what an interesting game between two merseyside teams .
everton fans doing everything in their power to stop suarez by abusing him likewise their players by fouling him ! nothing can stop him 
my god bt's coverage of the liverpool match is muck
merseyside derby ! go !
a very pulsating and entertaining first half ; everton are the side doing the playing and liverpool doing the scoring
a feisty merseyside affair so far . three goals , and a contentious refereeing decision . looking forward to the second half ... 
decent first half , everton should be a man down
can't believe that everton scum didn't get sent off for that challenge on suarez . if it was the other way around suarez would be off .
everton v liverpool then work üëç
 1st half answers : 1 ) 2-1 everton 2 ) steven gerrard 3 ) david moyes 4 ) andy carroll 5 ) steven gerrard & phil neville

sat‚öΩÔ∏è everton v liverpool 12.45 pm arsenal v southampton 3pm westham v chelsea 5.30 pm followed by 80ssoul & 90sdance with dj martin allenüéµüéâ
i don't like liverpool , but suarez is a fucking beast !
great first half for liverpool what a free kick that was miracles should of been sent of there though 
everton fans are booing suarez because he carried on after a leg breaking challenge ? everton logic .
now i hear everton fans spitting at suarez , fucking classless scumbags !!! üëé
if suarez had of done that challenge mirallas did , everton fans would be going mental right now lol
early goal and everton will win this .
sitting here think how fat mrs reilly fits threw the turnstile at everton 
liverpool be playing as if they wanna win the league .... by may , i see dem at no 6
suarez can win liverpool the title .
everton will score again in this game so you need another goal liverpool
correction : no more goals for everton , just alberto getting an off the volley goal from 35 yards away . üíÉ
enjoying the highly energetic merseyside derby . what an amazing start !? an extremely fast paced game ! 
terry butcher must be regretting taking the hibs job , he could've been watching the merseyside derby like everyone else
everton vs liverpool 1:2 half time . harsh play from the everton forward mirallas , terrible decision from the referee .
guy from liverpool
what liverpool should do now is enjoy being on the top while it lasts . üòÜüòÇüòÇ
half time liverpool everton perfect timing to see the try of the 
halftime everton 1-2 liverpool
anyone know the score in everton and liverpool ?
everton fans are so angry
lukaku in a back pocket of a liverpool defender jokes being written as we speak will appear in the next hour
c'mon everton get a goal back 
ht - everton 1-2 liverpool .. suarez is little bit injured 
suarez has now scored on all three of his trips to goodison park with liverpool 
no matter the result . everton cry for everything and are a bunch of filthy tackling diving bastards
half time : everton 1-2 liverpool 
my irony meter has just exploded . everton banner calling liverpool " bitter & twisted ". good one .
hopefully liverpool will keep this lead ! ¬£250 looking good if liverpool win ! #6fold
i predicted this everton collapse . replacing phil neville with gareth barry is like replacing tom cleverley with steven gerrard 
plis everton ... win this game ! :-(
liverpool leading woi
2-1 liverpool at half time top of the league at moment . like bt coverage first time sat through all of it
come on everton
would you think anything less from everton/liverpool ? suarez " bit " that free kick perfectly around the wall .
everton have only come from behind to win one of the last 91 derbies with liverpool . can they recover today ?
su√°aaaaarez scoreeeees !!! everton sucks !!
liverpool vs everton is such a famous derby
apparently missing a cracker in the derby . come on liverpool !
ilori is actually so hot . put him on to make up for the lack of sexy in everton's team .
need a goal from liverpool an everton 2nd half and il be happy
everton-liverpool 
hopefully liverpool and arsenal lose today
blimey , bt sport's dummy wall done a better job than everton's wall .
so much more passion in the merseyside derby than the manchester derby
well that miralles cunt should be off , and i'd love to give gareth barry loads of punches to the throat the wanker , come on liverpool 
whenever i watch liverpool play , i always look up at the score wondering quite how they've managed it ? sign of efficient finishing i guess ?
liverpool's first goal is proof that set-piece training can easily win you matches
liverpool game !
delighted to go in at half time ahead against everton . we recovered well after their equaliser . 
just turned over the merseyside derby at half time to witness the best pass i've ever seen in rugby league ! cummon new zealand ! 2013
i just want liverpool to lose today . thats all . and arsenal too . yup
liverpool will finish top 4 this season , favourite this tweet if you want , it will happen .
suarez will leave liverpool by january 2014
if liverpool signed one decent midfielder in january i could definitely see at least a top5 .
c'mon everton !

everton needs to not concede the easy goals as they did in the first . lukaku is due for one . up the blues ! 
liverpool get mad bench oo .. this match is gonna be deadly 
strange getting a everton decision to our advantage . that never happens .
lukaku was as poor as i've seen him all season in that first half - will need to improve if everton are to get anything from this game .
im confident everton will bounce back
the defeat of at old trafford changed the psych in .. it gave a chance to see the top4 , ginger in this game
the defeat of at old trafford changed the psych in .. it gave a chance to see the top4 , ginger in this game

andy gray and richard keys as pundits on the everton liverpool game , brilliant ! welcome home

any pubs in edinburgh showing todays semi final ? usual pubs showing merseyside derby . 2013

come on liverpool ! üôèüëå
half time : roberto martinez sings an old spanish folk song to the everton players . " we dont care what the red shite say " he croons . coyb
half-time replays show steven pienaar at fault for both liverpool goals . should've tracked coutinho and left a gap in the wall 
yes . the wednesday going down comfortably . will the rovers step up to the plate and get twatted ? liverpool letting me down , but still time .
merseyside derbies were obviously never friendly , but seems even more cynical from everton without moyes around .
le watching liverpool .. ynwa ... c'mon reds , beat the blues ..
" you'll never drink alone !" nice crowd for liverpool v everton at the half ... could use some more blue , though ...
liverpool day
i know a certain everton fan who will still claim dowd is biased towards liverpool 
also are everton fans genuinely ever happy ? their fans spend every derby just up to their neck in yearning for ' redshite ' blood !
looks like i'm missing a good merseyside derby ‚òπ
why is it derby day ? i thought everton was in london ?
come on everton get into them wall pushing bin dippers second half !!!!
gooolll naufal ahmad menit 43'liverpool 3-1 everton

i'd love love love to end this game death by football style in front of martinez & his " new everton " ... which looks a lot like the old one
everton 1 - 2 liverpool at half-time ! one of the most entertaining matches i've seen this season .
laughing at liverpool fans complaining that everton should be down to 10 men ! yeah ... i am afraid the correct decision was made 
can't stand liverpool fans !
counting on lukaku and barkley to screw liverpool over 
if you're amazed at how well flanno has done today and vs arsenal , then you clearly never watched liverpool in 2011
liverpool up 2-1 , half-time .
barkley better not do a rodwell . stay put in everton and develop .
everton should be down to 10 men , but dowd has less backbone than a jellyfish , and brains to match . 
come on you everton ...
would love to turn this round . i hate everything about liverpool fc - a club living on pat success .
just realised i'm out for the merseyside derby with a united fan on my t-shirt . 
can only laugh at the liverpool fans questioning people booing suarez , they're the lot who boo evra for a being a victim of racial abuse .
everton/pink floyd another brick in the wall ???
3-1 liverpool i predicted
if we win i will be the happiest girl alive today . come on liverpool don't let me down now
betfair lol . texting me the sp's for liverpool v everton game when its half time , bit l8 that i think
liverpool are very very very lucky to have a player like suarez coming from a liverpool fan
what did my fav player ( coutinho ) atm do to everton guise ?
more premier league action coming up after the merseyside derby ; it's arsenal v southampton live on setanta sports 1 from 2.30 pm .

we are allowing everton play all the game , we must bounce back
everton r lucky to still have 11 players on the park 
barkley to score hat trick in the second half c'mon for my fpl and to shame liverpool
honestly flabbergasted that dowd hasn't given that . did stevie not speak to him ? 
chicharito is one of my fav player even tho i support liverpool
luis suarez has scored more goals this season than everton ! haha 
despite this current result martinez is doing a good job at everton
english premier league half time everton-1 liverpool-2
coutinho is probably the only liverpool player i rate . the others are shit .
why do you do this to me everton ?
liverpool , you have to ... win ! 
perfect timing for half time of the merseyside derby . amazing try for new zealand in the rugby league semi final .

cska x spartak ou everton x liverpool ??
everton in running 7/1 to beat liverpool !!
liverpool need another goal ... 
 everton vs liverpool
goal goal liverpool !
everton players made themselves look like right cunts starting on the liverpool physio . their player nearly killed him for fuck sake
we need to hold the ball better next half , though i admit that everton did not threaten much . neither have we though ..
lol the liverpool physio was like give him the red card
how much i hate suarez but i would love for him to come to everton
everton liverpool and bayern dortmund .. today is a good day
up liverpool ...
i never enjoy liverpool games but this , this is a great game .
the referee must take out a red card against everton player intervention against suarez
the liverpool line up looks weak tho ! who's the falangan guy tho ?
it's a shame when pundits go on and on about a shocking everton wall and say nothing about a brilliant strike from luis suarez .
we are showing live football everton vs liverpool 
hope everton bring it back
4 me its eitha everton win or the game ends as a draw
liverpool :)
mon the liverpool !! ‚öΩÔ∏è
all these liverpool fans tweeting pictures of then being first üòÇi didn't know a football match was only 45 minutes long you mugs
the ref , everton fans and their players are all piece of shit ....
everton fans are similar to melbourne heart fans
one thing i know the ref is not in favour of liverpool
staying off twitter today until i can watch the everton game . i will not be looking at any of my interactions
but wait a minute , when a liverpool player gets away with a red it's a footballing disgrace ain't it blue boys ?

you're missing the heat if you're not watching everton vs liverpool
i believe in everton
the merseyside derby has everything again . great atmosphere , passion , tackles , goals . one of the best club clashes in the world . 
good result so far at half time for liverpool :) 2-1 against everton !
don't think gerrard had a great half nonetheless . we don't like the amount of pressure everton put . forcing mistakes
that sounds wrong . i only wore an everton top for an hour . honest .
walk on , walk on with hope in your heart and you'll never walk alone ! 
liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool liverpool
so far so good , next goal is incredibly crucial - come on liverpool !
liverpool :)
liverpool
suarez is so racist that out of all the everton players , he had to take advantage of a south african's stupidity .
cmon liverpool , come on ! 
liverpool standing second , you go babies :-)
need to keep the ball better .. decent half though ! c'mon liverpool 
coutinho adds creativity in liverpool .
sigh . everton , please !.

so just a norm saturday sat in the pub . watching the liverpool derby with the legend jim steele ! #76facupcaptainmom
people always want liverpool do badd -__- !!
can't really knock dowd as kev should probably have gone . took a lot of discipline not to send him for that in a derby game . 
c'mon everton !
everton are scum . 
imo liverpool are doing just a little bit too well , at the moment . note , i said ' at the moment '. 
barkley and mirallas look most likely to produce something for everton‚Äîlukaku very quiet . pienaar or howard at fault for second goal ?
half time : liverpool 2 - 1 everton 
dowd should have sent off the physio .... lol 
great first half , hopefully liverpool keep it up
liverpool have had alot of decisions over the last few years in derby's mirallas should of walked but ' it swings in roundabouts '
everton should try putting suge knight in goals and see if anyone notices
 - liverpool vs everton @ supersport
liverpool 2 - 1 everton !!! yeahh !! suarez !! more goal !!
ht : everton 1 - 2 liverpool . walk on !!!
liverpool have been fantastic tho ...... kudos to ' em
i should have known ! up liv'pool! merseyside derby !
watching the merseyside derby , in manchester 
refs are having far too much influence on games . if liverpool don't win then dowd will be slaghtered for not sending mirallas off .
liverpool can't win everton need to score
so far , me mother , the wife and i are winning . me father has a everton win or draw ...
why does the merseyside derby have to be on bt sport ? :( missing it
impressed by joe allen . broke down a few everton attacks and distributed the ball neatly . assured first half .
anyone mind telling me where the hell the everton v liverpool game is ?!
liverpool need to stay strong and score more in the second half
typical merseyside derby this morning . little blood , some colors flying . come on reds !
everton will score in the 2nd half so we obviously need a 3rd
liverpool ( y )
this merseyside derby should just end in a draw or a win for everton
away win at everton would be different class , can't see many teams winning there this season , good first half !! 
refreshing my twitter like fuck so i can see someone tweet about another liverpool goal ... c'moom you redsss

lukaku has to pull his finger out here , liverpool have had two shots and are winning . need that outlet up front !
liverpool please just maintain the lead in the second half .

eh how boss must it be scoring for liverpool in front of the glwadys imagine the fall of dickheads
liverpoolüòç
watching the liverpool game on canadia tv , just so i don't have to listen to owens abysmal commentary . 
just putting it out there , but everton would have a fucking great futsal team : pienaar , mirallas , deulofeu , baines , howard . 
liverpool 1.57 = the greatest bet u will ver have . 100 % free money . mortgage job . this will not lose . full bank on .
everton are a top side though .. this game is far from over ! need another goal still ... sturridge shud be fit enough to play 20min atleast
45 mins left . pride of merseyside
make me catch the second half of the merseyside darby ... it's a great day for football
retweet if your a liverpool fan !

epl : half-time update everton 1 - 2 liverpool

liverpool can win already please ...
everton vs liverpool then the arsenal vs southampton then dortmund vs bayern then i fall asleep . this is why i fail my exams .

 merseyside derby 
if liverpool win today i will put a liverpool player on the line for my next pink slips if everton win i will put an everton player up !

everton is gonna win this .
what a miss !! suarez was juggling the ball against 2 everton defenders then the ball falls to allen , 1 on 1 , and he puts it wide . poor
come on everton knock them the fuck out !
allen misses a perfect chance . it was totally disaster for liverpool . he had to score it .

allen during a torres . 
joe allen you have no impact in the liverpool squad . leave
sies these liverpool player is a cow ... how do u miss 1-1 lyk that ? foolish
liverpool have only scored 5 goals in the second half all season . joe allen has made sure it stays there .
he won't get a better chance than that to score his first goal for liverpool
joe allen endearing himself to liverpool supporters ... 
woah liverpool had a chance 
joe allen ! now i understand the reason you never play 4 liverpool 
everton are getting back into this game

and he never played for liverpool again
funny game this liverpool game !
yeeeepa !!!.. seee that miss !!! liverpool o

sheep shagging cunt wtf is he doing at liverpool dirty welsh cunt fuck off back to swansea
got to work late . didn't finish the liverpool game . and i'm mega tired . but my hair is great .
liverpool abusando de perder gol ... 
joe allen scoffed a great chance ! by the way , why everton defence would allow a suarez meandering into the box beats me .
seriously liverpool ?! how the hell can you not score with that opportunity !
jehovah !!!!............ how did that not go in ? what a miss and liverpool may just rue the chance
thank god they missed . everton will get back in it !
fucking hell dad watching some stupid award show then cant watch liverpool and everton fucking cb

looooool another torres at liverpool üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ i'm so dead so so dead üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üòÇüòÇ
how could a liverpool player miss such an attempt like that "?!?!
joe allen = not a liverpool player
a draw would be nice ... 
that miss sums up joe allen's time at liverpool .
wow joe allen did you really just miss that ? 
everton deserve a draw they just have to . 
hopefully liverpool will regret that miss
liverpool vs everton , score guys ? ma ele jlede dawe el tv .
seems to be lots of space in this game . joe allen insistent on remaining goalless for liverpool . don't remember him scoring for wales either
refs an everton fan
come on liverpool 
that's 3 times everton has hung howard out to dry . can't believe that wasn't buried in the back of the net . 
darn ! what a miss !!! how do you miss that ?? should have been everton 1-3 liverpool . awesome work by suarez . went unfinished . 
the everton vs . liverpool game is a great so far .
liverpool could regret missing that chance
that's it joe allen is officially the worst player to have ever put on a pair of liverpool boots , and that list includes diao + traore 
everton vs liverpool
mugeyi is playing for liverpool .... as joe allen !!!
i will celebrate when he leaves liverpool , he is the worst player ever to play for them
let this be the final word from me on him . joe allen was a good prospect two years ago . now he is not good enough for liverpool
everton should just become a rugby team
just started watching liverpool game , anyone know why sturridge isnt involved ?
come on everton
that jus sums up his liverpool career so far ! 
liverpool's small tribute to torres . 
liverpool's very own xavi hahahaha
if not i think 4 goals . but ah wasted too many alrd . c'mon liverpool .
it could have 3-2 to liverpool by now lol 
cracking game this merseyside derby
wow probably the goal miss of the season there by liverpool's joe allen
miss of the season by joe allen , 60 mins gone , everton 1-2 liverpool
miss of the season . joe allen should have buried that for a liverpool 1 : 3 lead .
: everton have only come from behind to win one of the last 91 derbies with liverpool . can they recover today ? "
even liverpool fans will laugh at that miss from allen . shocker .
that's the end of allen's liverpool career . 
i will pay money for joe allen to leave liverpool
supporting everton is sore ... but then again liverpool have allen
allen is possibly the worst liverpool player since poulsen/konchesky ??
with the screams coming from the kitchen i'm assuming liverpool are playing and they aren't doing too good ? do i want a drink that badly üôä
come on everton wake up lads
everton vs liverpool , good way to start the morning 
hahahhahah joe allan you moron , and that right there is why liverpool will never win the league again
will that allen chance go down as a failed pass forward ? 
everton have no tactics . just cross it to lukaku .
joe allen you have gifted everton a life line it should be 3-1
everton(mirallas ) is getting away with so much
liverpool 2 vs everton 1 now live !
indeed liverpool needs quality after what i just saw from allen
if liverpool don't win , joe allen shouldn't be aloud to play football ever again !
that's definitely not going to help allen's return to popularity amongst liverpool fans
everton could of take cuenca instead
hows heskey looking now liverpool ?!
i‚Äôd be happy to never see him in a liverpool kit again
with no goalkeeper this piece of shit cant score ????? jesus , man ... this is a fucking merseyside derby .
 what a bad miss . liverpool could have sealed the match .
joe allen what are you doing that would of been game over if everton draw or win now i will be fuming
what a miss from allen :( c'mon liverpool keep going !
gr8 match 
 lol 
liverpool will pay for that miss .
ahaha joe allen is fucking wank ! but liverpool's 2nd best player
liverpool's midfield definitively more into the game now . anything can happen .
allen defending well - for everton- that was a wtf moment !!!
how is joe allen even still a liverpool player ? he's fucking awful
just seen the 1st half tackle on suarez how on earth is that everton psychopath still on the pitch . dowd needs glasses .
liverpool just missed the easiest open goal , oh lord .
if liverpool dont win now i wont be happy !
everton playing rough
nearly missed the merseyside derby
damn , liverpool was nothing without suarez . he was invincible .
i hope everton score after that miss from joe allen . awful !
liverpool's welsh xavi . haha !
in this merseyside derby
what a miss joe allen . should be 3-1 for liverpool .
joe allen with a level miss . wow . that could‚Äôve sealed the merseyside derby .
frustrated everton is frust . lolz
unbeaten everton down the drain ?
you better win liverpool
whoaaa liverpool fans u still can't @ me till end of all games !! if u win that is lol
 ... gooo ..! hidup liverpool
everton just survive but how did allen miss that
buen liverpool . 
damn !! just missed a sitter . 
joe allen may pray that liverpool win this 
allen doesnt deserve to wear the liverpool kit . end of
why does joe allen play for liverpool
when did liverpool sign matri ?
why couldn't that be anyone else in a liverpool shirt , if it was it'd be 3-1 
i really hope liverpool get punished ... fuckin idiots
i think joe allen is liverpool's equivalent of tom cleverley . never really does anything
joe allen just pulled a torres , maybe even worse 
joe allen is wank in my opinion ! since he's been at liverpool he's not done anything good !
had allen somehow managed to put away that sitter , it would have been awfully harsh on . total luck the ball ended up there anyway .
is there a worse sound in the world than the everton whine ? 
dowd seems to have a grip on merseyside derby
one of the liverpool players need to crack an everton player to get this ' proper ' merseyside started üòâ
in which liverpool tempt fate . 90thminutedraw
whew . can't believe allen missed that . shouldn't have had that opportunity in the first place . come on everton ! 
lukaku and delofeu . all of everton's scoring is loaned .
i've half a mind to travel to merseyside and burn everything that joe allen owns .
i'm sure if liverpool don ; t win this game suarez will kill allen after the game lol .
joe allen to accrington stanley for ¬£35 , that'd be a good sell for liverpool
if everton end up coming back . allen will never wear the red shirt again
c'mon liverpool üò¨üòè
what a miss . joe allen is an undercover everton player .
yesterday this liverpool girl did not stop speaking to me and i didn't understand a word she said
who the fuck is joe allen anyway and why the hell is he playing for liverpool in the first place shit cunt
will that be a costly miss on liverpool's part ? 
loo even mi lil sister would a score dat 
everton better equalize tho
miss of the season . if everton get back in the game that could cost big time .
what a mistake allen !! u must could change score 3-1 for liverpool ..
liverpool had the opportunity to kill off the game there , let's hope it comes back to bite them in the back passage !!!
joe allen better get off my tele n never show his face in a liverpool shirt again !!!!! how ?!
im a liverpool fan and even im clueless how people can say suarez is the best striker in the world 
nw // everton vs liverpool #1 -2
ohh ! almost score for liverpool-__- " 221
everton gin equalise tho
everton needs to bring out mirallas
liverpool 
joe allen yel3an abo omak 
come on everton we need a draw or let liverpool lose
 everton vs liverpool
allen ?! brendan rodgers thought he wa better than sahin , i like allen but sahin walks into the liverpool midfield .
can this liverpool keeper be injured already
i say liverpool should bring on sturridge .
everton living dangerously . but how naismith can't get a start is something i'll never know
how on earth did you miss that one , joe allen ? 
everton fans are like carlton fans . just argue everything that goes against them 
if they tie this match liverpool should suspend allen for 6 weeks
 could still end up costing 3 points
everton are worse than stoke ..
if mirallas scores an equaliser liverpool fans will be vexed
 : miss of the week ? joe allen misses a chance to put liverpool ahead after been teed up by luis suarez , allen shooting wide !
i'd have scored that with my left foot ! dreadful ! ..... i'm terrible on my left foot ! 
kevin mirallas can literally do whatever he wants ! dowd must support everton
that allen miss might just come back and bite liverpool on the ass 
everton fans gutted with allen's miss . 
i'd be happy for joe allen to be sold ... been useless for liverpool
cmon everton ffs get the draw .
i don't understand why everton persist with the high crosses when its 3 v 1 in there and lukaku is better with back to goal .
even torres wouldnt have missed that !! thats gonna cost liverpool .
that was liverpool's first open play shot by the way
liverpool shouldn't pay allen for this week . that was a sitter he just missed .
everton vs liverpool what a good game .
what a miss 
what a miss ! joe allen just missed a sitter ! everton 1 v liverpool 2
everton , come on ; don't let these dildos win .
its astonishing that instead of everton vs liverpool or dortmund vs munich , the only game skysports has today is sheff wed vs huddersfield .
oh putain le rater de fou ... üòÆ 
 liverpool vs everton
joe allen might just have cost liverpool few points with that miss 
joe allen seals his name in the liverpool folklore , poor kid
joe allen refuses to give liverpool some respite after all that pressure .
liverpool down to 10 men . joe allen . 
lol ! that was an open goal . liverpool could have made a 3-1 already .
but still go go everton
liverpool you better effin win this one my dad just said " shit " just cause you missed a goal
saurez should leave liverpool for title winning team
allen is crazy ..... dat was a sitter !!.. liverpool's joe allen i mean ... lol !
is joe allen is a everton fan ?
i fucking knew everton would fuck it up big time today .... cunts
liverpool has torres no more . but liverpool has allen now .
why do we play joe allen ? what does he seriously bring to liverpool ?
c'mon everton one goal !
haha . liverpool get a free kick for flanagan draping his arms across the back of mirallas .
luis suarez is a king in liverpool . that guy can't just stop scoring goals 
amazing merceyside everton and liverpool both missed great chances
watching football with my dad can get pretty annoying , cause apparently any player who's not a liverpool player is a ' cheat ' - . -
joe allen hasn't scored for liverpool . after missing that chance , he doesn't deserve another chance ! sell him . useless . if we lose now ...
everton should of had player off by now
supporting everton cause liverpool 2nd place on the table and ni tkle jady
if liverpool don't win now i shall hunt down joe allen and snap my fingers in a z formation in front of him
joe allen is fu***ng shit what did liverpool see in him when they brought him
freekick to liverpool ...
that's why liverpool will never win anything , if they continue to keep signing shitheads like allen and henderson etc
everton vs liverpool match is just like gladiators @ war
hope that allen miss doesn't come back to haunt liverpool . 
how has allen missed that sitter ? lucky there 
joe allen gets through after the ball hits off a few everton defenders . 1 v 1 around the penalty spot . hits it wide . huge chance
i need everton to score abeg
one more goal everton , please :)
2 absolute sitters missed so far . everton could easily be level , liverpool could easily have made it comfortable .
come on everton
joe allen spurns a clear-cut chance to make it 3-1 to liverpool , sliding the ball wide from only 10 yards out .
everton will now score smh
liverpool misses and pirates scores to make it 1-1 against supersports
joe allen why why why come on liverpool put this game to bed
liverpool deserve to lose after that attempt from joe allen
if liverpool fail to come away with all three points today , joe allen will need to be taken out the back and shot !!!
watch everton equalise now ...
come on liverpool !
the only reason why i want liverpool to win is because i don't want arsenal to be top of the league and liverpool are closest to them
wow , liverpool do have some really shit players
everton have been the more dominant but not created much . liverpool been clinical with there 2 chances but not joe allen .
hmmm i wonder if liverpool will go on to regret that chance !
what ... a ... miss ! hasn't been as good at liverpool as he was at swansea 
that should have been 3-1 liverpool ‚öΩ
 wtf !! vs 
come on everton . 
come on lah liverpool hoi
joe allen ! take off that shirt & vanish back into the hills of wales .. what a cunt ! how did he miss that ?! 
what a missed opportunity from liverpool ... 
kevin mirallas is battering liverpool , just not in the way a quick skillful winger should be . 
joe missed a game clincher for but the reds still lead 1-2
i'm sorry i don't watch liverpool games .
unbelievable pass from the new zealand guy for their try .. unbelievable miss from joe allen from 6yards for liverpool ! 
 vs .... got me at the edge of ma seat !!
joe allen's career is now over if everton come back haha
joe allen should have a months pay docked for that . my 9yr old would have buried it . 
did everton pay off allen to miss that goal ? shocking miss
 liverpool vs everton
being in a scouse house with a mixture of liverpool and everton fans on derby day is tense
who be this " deulofeu " for everton na !, no be spanish league be this oh ..
everton didn't even need howard on allen's shot , that was just awful to watch
i'm sorry joe but for that miss you deserve to be taken off . absolute shocking miss should be 3-1 . come on liverpool !!
come on liverpool one more goal needed and it's the 3 points #3 
this merseyside derby looks like a championship game 
why is joe allen even with liverpool never mind starting !
ferocious miss by allen ! i would have scored that ! still everton 1-2 liverpool . 
wow joe allen is shite . liverpool completely bought the wrong welshman .
if everton equalise then joe allen should seriously be benched
why are fans standing behind goal and fans also standing in away end plus liverpool fans stand on kop standing
why does joe allan play for liverpool ? :/ 
that would've been 3 - 1 to liverpool
come on everton
liverpool's players like to milk the challenges ....
liverpool's joe allen miss should be the miss of the year . idiot . 
liverpool ‚úå
flanagan is ripping everton a new one , its actually embarrassing for them
well ... joe allen leading everton into a false sense of security there obviously 
omg , that miss was everton luck man .
those who doubt jagielka's ability just because he plays for everton , really are foolish .
there you go liverpool . you get your own torres moment !
idiot . 
well that has just summed up joe allen's liverpool career ..!!
some fantastic attacking from everton and liverpool !!!
che gran derby di liverpool 
literally can't stand everton . distin is basically heskey if he ever played in defence
everton come on ! just get those goals !!
everton are missing a trick here .
freekick to liverpool
60 mins gone 1-2 liverpool
vital that liverpool shore up the gaps at the back . cannot let everton break through again .
i hate joe allen with a passion . rogers needs to rethink his strategy ... and how everton still have 11 men is beyond me .
joe allen has just been pure ass for liverpool 
bt sport you liverpool loving pricks .... keep trying to say mirallas so be lucky but lucas is giving away free kick after free kick
liverpool need to release joe allen right this minute how did he miss 
it's amazing how liverpool actually win games when they play players like flannagan allen and henderson üòÇüò≠
lets go 
this is what liverpool are without suarez : shit
how mirallas is still on the pitch for everton baffles me
hahaha fuck off bumming liverpool ! red card my arse
finally home , now to sort myself out and get ready for liverpool tonight ! yessssss 
what a miss from allen . my nephew can scored it 
liverpool are going to be top of the premier league aren't they ? what a shite state of affairs that is .
no barclays for tonight , my liverbird pls lead our match against merseyside blue , im counting on you
joe allen misses absolute sitter . he'll hear about that again if don't end up winning this . 
if liverpool lost today itss all because of allen .... stupid he missed that golden chance ... shittttt man
 liverpool vs everton
coutihno is playing frighteningly well but , seriously , why do liverpool waste their time with joe allen ? 
everton need to use lukaku's power and ability to hold th ball up , he's not seeing much of the ball but he's a game changer 
the quality on display in this merseyside derby is of the highest order ! excellent football ! 
no . 11 best player on this everton side for me
in the pub with loads of liverpool fans . god they are funny
what a miss by allen ! damn ! personally hope equalize .. 
i fucking hate everton ! finish them of liverpool !
that is a great miss , because , if liverpool dont win , allen will get the blame . pressure of dowd . but oh my
deulofeu looks piss poor for everton ! üòú
dinguerie le match liverpool everton dinguerie total
come on everton .
even if everton lose this game , still satisfied , joe allen's point blank miss made my night 
it still 2-1 to liverpool .
i think that miss alone should mean allen never playing for liverpool again ! 
everton vs liverpool now ! 1-2 with liverpool leading ! hell yeah ! beer , soccer and buddies .
great merseyside derby so far , froch groves on tonight too . a wonderful day for betting
everton x liverpool ! pace and strength .
everton > liverpool
remember i said this .. joe allen just cost liverpool this match
come on everton get these scouse bastards beat
c'mon everton ! 
mirillas your fucking scum 
come on liverpool ! ynwa 
dont think suarez will still b at liverpool after january ..
i'm sure phil dowd will sleep well in his everton duvet tonight you fat shit
 with an astonishing miss ! still searching for his first goal and it's pretty clear why ... 
get of the way merseyside derby , nz v england in rugby league semis is where it's at
oh my gawd how did he missed that if he was right in front of the goal üòÇ 
this liverpool everton match sweet die !
how is worth 15m !! 
joe allen is unfathomably bad . end the nepotism , rodgers . 
awesome match vs 
how is allen inbthe liverpool starting eleven . more useless than a chocolate fire guard
can't believe liverpool spent so much to buy allen ... 
liverpool v everton - joe allen , what a miss ! miss of the season ?
we can't beat everton and the ref
nanny just comes out with it .. ' had a dream last night that i walked to the liverpool match with gerrard holding hands ' hahaha wee petüòÇ
this is a real feisty merseyside derby ... end to end stuff .
allen for just clear everton's doubt
i swear those bt sport models would be more effective than the everton defence today .
not building any momentum here whatsoever . lucas played well for liverpool today , as much as i dislike using those words consecutively .
lucky sia liverpool din score !
how can mirallas still be on the pitch ?!?! 
what a chance 2 on 1 , pretty much an open net for joe allen and he missed , if we lose it's on him ! still 2-1 liverpool
joe allen cost liverpool ¬£15m you know
60mins : everton 1 v 2 liverpool
 liverpool vs everton .
these liverpool swine and play acting
missed 5 games for liverpool , but has scored more goals than the entire side . 
that was the game right there - should be interesting to see if liverpool do tie/lose , they'll reflect upon that moment 
lets be honest ! luis suarez is too good a player to play at liverpool . come on real .
kevin mirallas has drawn blood from two liverpool players but still remains on the pitch . 
like huddersfield and sheffield wednesday is on sky sports one and liverpool aren't ?
everton everton evertoooon
flanagan putting in a shift here 
that sums up joe allen's time at liverpool , a complete joke !
liverpool would hate playing on the outdoor pitches at the soccerdome . they're dead rough there .
3 players that have drawn blood today what is wrong with everton
when liverpool finish sixth they'll look back at that miss as the turning point 
aah liverpool playing with chances !
liverpool all the way
liverpool going hard on mirallas
amazing dribble by suarez to pass 3 defenders with through pass but poor finishing . lucky everton .
don't you just love when liverpool players get yellow cards
everton are so there for the taking its unreal .
liverpool are the biggest gangs of faggots hahaha
if that score i think everton can bye bye ald .
that was a great miss for liverpool 
if liverpool don't win this game me and joe allen are done
liverpool fans will still argue that joe allen is the 3rd best centre mid in the league ( 1st- gerrard , 2nd- lucas )
go liverpool
dowd ?? how the hell have everton still got 11 men
the red and blue of merseyside and manchester are nothing compared the londons arsenal and chelsea 
mirallas ths boi has is causing a headache for liverpool
martinez has made everton a better team , can't say the same of moyes .
wow ! liverpool just missed a wide open goal . wide open 
61 minutes for the first yellow card on a liverpool player .
hope liverpool win
am hoping everton draw with liverpool . is lukkaku part of this game . well am listening to commentary , well his name is hardly been mentioned
what is allen still doing in liverpool
come on everton !
 everton vs liverpool 
come on everton :d
phil dowd , fucking terrified of sending an everton player off at goodison
allen best hope liverpool take all 3 points after that miss ! üôà
everton under david moyes won't be losing this game .
come on u everton !!!
61 ' yellow card for liverpool's joe allen .
joe allen is the shittist liverpool player to ever put on tha shirt . ever tho
phil dowd is an everton fan !!!
allen ?!?! please score liverpool 
i really want joe allen to do well for liverpool . the same way i really want to win the lottery . odds are stacked , 
how the fuck is mirallas still on the pitch ? üòí 
 everton vs liverpool .
i hope liverpool finish off everton i fucking hate them , shit fans shit team shit club
joe allen you are woeful ! also how is mirralas still on the pitch ?! come on liverpool !
watching the merseyside derby wondering why fellaini isn't on the pitch .. then i remember where he plays * sigh *
nice to know that with screech gone , everton still have a moronic thug like mirallas in their side .
great shot from above of liverpool's 1-4-1-4-1 . they have a 2-1 lead , away from home and have 10 men behind ball . will play on counter now .
 proving , you never score alone 
joe allen is liverpool's fellaini !! 
joe allen is the shitest player to ever put on a liverpool shirt
if liverpool don't win now because of joe allen i will be pissed off .
for all the liverpool fans who claimed allen was better than ramsey , you need medical help
they need to exploit liverpool's 3 slower players in the middle by playing lower , speedier crosses and cutbacks .
59 ' easy chance for allen , but not goal in . 99% goal chance wasted . 
i sincerely hope joe allen never puts on another liverpool jersey after this game
joe allen forgiven by liverpool fans now ...
go go go the reds . liverpool 
why is joe allen still in liverpool
everton fans have stopped booing . oh we got a yellow card
cmon liverpool !!!
liverpool vs everton what an exciting match !!
bet liverpool fans wish that was a red ...
62'- everton 1-2 liverpool 
liverpool need one more goal
joe allen is genuinely dire . cannot believe he's in a team like liverpool 
that should have been 3-1 liverpool
these everton matches always piss me off .
if everton think they're a good team , then play football . unbelievable thugs , tragic to watch .
fuck everton liverpool it's all about england new zealand
allen , if everton scores you're gonna get so much shit .
this mirallas .. number 11 for everton is a dirty player b 
joe allen misses a glorious chance to put liverpool ahead . harder to miss than score there . still everton 1 liverpool 2 #61mins
if liverpool dont get 3 points it is absolutely 100% that sheep shagging cunts fault 
how can joe alln miss 4rm there come on boys , now yellow card great everton
come on everton üëè
and now allen gets a yellow . worst liverpool player on the pitch today .
wow ... i love my blues .... but your defense is absolutely horrible . should have been 3-1 if liverpool hadn't missed that goal shot

brandan rodgers is great friends with martinez . that's why joe allen is starting . liverpool started the game with 10 men !
i will say this that based on this performance , liverpool won't be anywhere near the top four . just too many weak links .
liverpool's pressing intense so far today . everton have no time whatsoever - wonder if they'll be able to keep it up for 90 mins . 
how do you even miss that ...... shitty liverpool players
watching merseyside derby in south stand with my two lads
u cud see some of these everton attackers dont play enough fifa

liverpool always seem to beat everton at goodison park
joe allen's liverpool days have got to be numbered .... 
everton are playing stupid
there are far too many players in this liverpool team that are so far off suarez's wave-length it's painful to watch
how the hell did joe allen miss that ... should have been 3-1 to liverpool
a big collective fuck off to everton
with 1 kick joe allen underlines why his days at liverpool are numbered and the number is low .. 
considering mirallas has bloodied 2/11 of the liverpool starting lineup maybe he shouldn't be on the pitch 
this liverpool vs everton game is too good
everton wasting a million chances !
how much liverpool paid for allen ? ¬£15m yeah ?

lukaku should have scored there , everton got to take their chances 
damn you , mignolet . come on , everton
this liverpool game is bonkers . bonkers in striking . chance after chance going begging !
two of evertons best chances in this half have come from liverpool errors
goal keeper for liverpool good man
everton dominating 2nd half 
if liverpool had a midfield and/or a defence they could really go places .
do everton players know how to chip the fucking ball ? 
come in everton get a draw here at least
mignolet has been brendan rodgers best signing at liverpool . guy have been pretty fucking good for them this season
liverpool are so much better without reina
how the hell can everton squander these chances ? it's disgusting to watch
everton to score now
why ain't everton scored yet they playing üíØüòí
liverpool doing their best to chuck this away . so many unforced errors .
come on everton ..
it should be 1-3 liverpool 
why do liverpool piss around with the ball too much ?

liverpool have a quality top class goalkeeper good saves in the second half
however much liverpool spent on mignolet , it was a bargain . everton could easily be level , if not leading , at this point . 
that should be an easy pissy goal for liverpool .!
leighton baines has been substituted off in a premier league game for the first time since september 2008 ( everton v hull) .
everton neva ready to equalize
everton cant score .. smh
come on everton !
as much as i want to see deulofeu stick one in the net , flanagan's immense performance deserves a liverpool win to go along with it .
come on everton
if it wasnt for mignolet liverpool would be sitting where they were last year !
what does joe allen actually bring to this liverpool team ?
come on everton !!
mignolet was a brilliant signing for liverpool top keeper

63 ' lukaku chance , but simon block it . good saved ! 
too many wasted chances by everton today ... nice save tho frm d liverpool goalie .
mignolet has kept liverpool in the game 2ce now . man of the match ??? 
everton are well on top atm
mignoley brilliant there but everton continue to pull them apart . don't make changes , roberto .
everton needs better finishing and some luck
liverpool living very dangerously here . have a feeling they could come to regret that joe allen miss
no matter how good lucas gets , he'll never be a proper replacement for what xabi alonso could do at liverpool .
a good buy for liverpool
everton's finishing has been so poor
poor decision making from everton strikers . shooting when they should go round the keeper/trying to go round the keeper instead of shooting
some say the referee is everton's 12th men .
matchday merseyside derby , 1-2 for anfield gank
everton is gonna win this they are flying all over the place .
that allen miss will haunt liverpool here .
this is a cracking merseyside derby .
liverpool may have the best striker and goalkeeper in the league .
yeah he's playing quality ! if everton score joe allen is gonna get so much shit
wonder if any liverpool players fancy helping mignolet ?
if it wasn't for mignolet everton woulf have been leading 3-2
chance ! lukaku muscles his way through liverpool's defence , shoots strong and mignolet saves well again , liverpool still lead 2-1
liverpool matches seem so happening . then all of chelsea‚Äôs matches are boring crap .

this merseyside derby hasn't been overflowing with quality but it's made up for it with pace and passion . mignolet has been outstanding .
what is worry with this refree ?,.. give these eventon's player red card , is it untill they broke someone leg here ?.... eventon 1 liverpool 2 .
actually love the liverpool accent
won't be long until everton scores if they keep attacking
mignolet has kept us in this . liverpool haven't really played well tbh . gerrard in particular has been crap . flanagan's been great though !
i always shake unbearingly when i watch liverpool okay . idk if it's cause i'm nervous or that the games are always 4 in the freaking morning
mignolet you're my favourite . 
mignolet vs everton
we have mignolet , they don't . 
liverpool lacks the finish yet again in the second half . thats two crucial save from mignolet so far in the second half 
liverpool vs everton ... this aint a soccer match , this is war ... game aint even flowing , all i hear is the referee's whistle ..
come on everton .
lukaku with another one-be-one chance , but mignolet comes out tops everton 1 liverpool 2 #65mins
phil dowd should never be left near a liverpool game
terrific save !! lukaku was put through on the left side but mignolet's outstretched arm saves liverpool
everton vs liverpool üòç
come on everton
" everton looking disjointed " claims michael owen . what fucking game are you watching ?
liverpool has the best keeper in the epl
frustraaaaaating that everton are doing well in getting the ball into the final 3rd but can't finish * cough * lukaku * cough *
everton ! come do something
liverpool made a brilliant signing in mignolet ..... and he is second choice in d belgian nt ....
everton have had more than enough chances to equalise , maybe even take the lead . game will stay as is or pool gets one more .
watching everton liverpool on my own as the liverpool fan in the house has fucked off to the cinema .
i think someone is smiling on everton today 
how many times he has saved liverpool's arse this season .. 
it's been busy in the shop today and come on you red's 
that guy can win liverpool fc the league
is it possible to cheer for both everton and liverpool this merseyside derby ? no ? well i will do it anyways . great game so far .
liverpool : 3 shots , 2 on target , 2 goals . that's the difference . we cannot finish .
this everton v liverpool game has been pretty exciting actually
simon mignolet , the best thing that has happened to liverpool fc since steven gerrard .
wonder how many pundits say mignolet is world class now that he is doing exactly the same things he done for us but now for liverpool
everton giving everything they got .
woahhhh baik uh mignolet . twice you saved liverpool's ass
everton more like " everton " 2nd half . faster tempo all round . fancy them to get something now . just got to be wary of the break
everton should be winning
reina would of saved that and then scissor kicked it in to everton's goal
mignolet with another huge save for liverpool . possible man of the match .
 : en 64 ', [ everton 1-2 liverpool ]
shocking that players didnt have a minutes applause for paul o'grady before the merseyside derby
( 63 mins ) still 1-2 to hope our defence can hold on to the lead . 
liverpool 2-1 everton
how many times has mignolet saved liverpool this season ? great buy .
mignolet has saved liverpool today , what a keeper
let's compare liverpool to a club elsewhere in europe apart from england .
everton knocking on the door now . 
liverpool fans are gonna be so pissed off if mirallas grabs a 90th minute equaliser ...
the fact that we've had more shots on target shows that liverpool have been better tbh ...
liverpool are the luckiest epl side this season . their gk is top class
everton have combative midfielders tho ...
mignolet the man , saved liverpool's ass
jake garlitz and i could've finished both of those 1v1's that everton had ...
liverpool are almost the surprise of the season for me . still can't see them making top 4 .
lukaku . so class . mignolet makes himself big and denies the everton equalizer .
wasteful everton 
twice mignolet saves liverpool after defenders give the ball away sloppily high up the pitch . great shot stopper . 
if everton loses , its their fault
another good chance for everton should of taken it really good keeping though
everton cant finish their dinner
this match must end on a 
red card for any liverpool player would be so acceptable if mirallas got chopped in half as a result
one more goal , come on liverpoolüòâ
reminded me of schmeichel then 
watching lfc vs everton ! 
what must have stopped me from watching today's merseyside derby must be something very significant
local football derby .... everton vs liverpool ..... most inconsistent on the pitch is the referee
before the allen miss the goals were liverpool's only shots .
big simon !!!! c'mon !!!
the fuck is this man ?? everton you're getting these crazy chances n missing
wth r liverpool defense doing
lukaku , baines and barry are the only good players for everton
everton looking really good , one chance will be put in the back of the net shortly 
if liverpool win this match , mignolet is motm surely . 
i'd lose my shit if everton score now . i will come to liverpool from australia to find joe allen and teach him how to score
come on everton !!
home at last . now time for the merseyside derby
everton should have scored twice in the half ....
mignolet could be motm of this finishes 1-2 to liverpool . saved three 1on1s and a crazy good barkley attempt !
come on everton !!
mignolet is the reason why everton are trailing
another poor finish from yet another everton player .
how good is this merseyside derby ? best premier league game of the season so far .
miglonet for motm today . keeping liverpool in it
mignolet was good business by liverpool . those are the sort of saves reina had stopped making . he'll get better too .
come on liverpool , hold on
mignolet ( spoonhead ) is definately liverpool's saviour today
liverpool can't win the league with mediocre players like allen and henderson
philippe coutinho a star , and the keeper having a blinder for liverpool . still reckon everton have another goal in them .
when we watch liverpool my dad constantly shouts at the telly
liverpool har to attempts on target , tre totalt .
 should have taken the lead by 3-2 already . 
come on everton , get this equalizer 
liverpool's defense is so so bad .
glad i've finally managed to tune into this match now , everton and liverpool going at it big style .
now i see why these liverpool fans say mignolet > szczesny .
come on block everton
mignolet should also earn me some points he has saved liverpool twice in the second half 
if allen could pass it into the net , like he does his teammates , this could have been 5-3 to everton with mignolet . phew .
liverpool thank you
everton's level of douchiness has decreased just a tiny bit since the departure of fellaini
mignolet keeping liverpool in this game 
mignolet saves liverpool's bacon like every match üòí
haha merseyside stand up . wonderful football on show
everton score pls !
from what i've seen everton are working a lot harder than liverpool , they'll be lucky to keep their lead
coyb everton
seems everton are running out of steam . liverpool much in control .
still mad mignolet went to liverpool 
everton taking the piss . can't finish
why are we leaving so much space for everton to counter ?!
i'm wondering how is this match of everton and liverpool gonna finish
 two bleeding liverpool players .... one studs up and one punched ?!?!
everton unlucky in this game simon m is playin well
this will be the kiss of death ... flanagan is having a good game for liverpool so far
liverpool are quality this year
this everton v liverpool game is very entertaining ...
mignolet has been immense for liverpool today
liverpool is the best
liverpool everton game is quite good considering
just tell we'll get caught on the break soon enough . prove me wrong everton just fucking do it
not a chance everton are scoring . this will end 3-1 .
either mignolet is very lucky , or everton is super unlucky . or both . yes , both .
this l'pool everton game is end to end stuff .. superb for the neutrals !
flanagan backs up what i fully believe about the merseyside derby . always play the scousers .
when we signed mignolet i gave him alot shit because he replaced reina but he is a great keeper and a great signing for liverpool 
everton threatening a lot but i guess liverpool might get the goal .
everton's pressing so good
that right arm of simon mignolet just save liverpool from being equalised by romelu lukaku .
liverpool defense slipping ... thank gos for simon
this liverpool goalie is on top form today ! 
liverpool should share points na
everton need to be more clinical ..
8 ocasions d gol pel everton , 3 pel liverpool ! still 1-2=efectivitat ! 
this liverpool game is freaking awesome
i recall liverpool fans being underwhelmed by the signing of mignolet as well . absolute spacks .
liverpool are very average .
che giocatore james mccarty .. 
mignolet probably the buy of the season for us ! like pepe played when he started at liverpool . 
liverpool : 3 shots , 2 on target , 2 goals . that's how you win !
liverpool !!!!
liverpool winning a match where they are stolen ... where are the red cards ?
rugi la everton so many one on one situations gone .
if liverpool lose , blame it on allen lol
wouldn't mind a liverpool draw !
everton are out playing liverpool deserve more
the tackling by liverpool's defenders has also been spot-on today .
migs has kept liverpool in it , just like joe allen has for everton üòâ
everton , all i want is a draw .
welcome to champions league 2013-2014 . good job ! * liverpool *

it's getting intense in the girls group chat 
i swear i'll cry if i find out everton equalise and finishes 2-2 üòÇ 
mignolet with 3 top drawer saves keeps out everton ....
liverpool would have a better chance of winning today if steven gerrard was playing .
everton deserve at least a point
mignolet is really keeping liverpool in this game today . everton could easily be in the lead right now
everton continue to lose sitters . they're losing this one .
everton be making mignolet feel high ... smh
everton wives , run for your lives .....
come on everton .....
the goals has lost ehn ....
everton are playing like their life depends on it . which is the way to go . 
the difference between liverpool 2013/14 season and last season is simon mignolet !
can see an equaliser from everton ..
thats it , liverpool need reina back . 
lukaku will be everton's saviour
this is the best everton i have ever seen .
absolute cracker of a derby ! 
that is why i bought skrtel . stopping lukaku and shit . one of the best for liverpool
everton playing a 6 man defense from my point of view
mignolet keeping liverpool in the game ! 
i'd get sturridge on . put everton on the back foot .
come on everton haisss
simon mignolet has won liverpool about the same number of points as luis suarez has so far this season . great shot-stopper . 
win for everton .... hopefully
c'moon liverpool , win this one 
amusement at liverpool having flanagan and allen playing . give us a song !
liverpool .. everton .... match on fire
simon mignolet is with out any doubt the man of the match ! #2pl
aysh everton score a fucken equalizer already u biatches !...
how many chances do everton want before liverpool go up the other end and give suarez a tap in ?
how many more chances will everton waste ?
i fucking hate everton
i'm on mignolet quite a lot and to be fair shot stopping is not his problem but he's kept liverpool in this
come on liverpool keep it together
anak lem liverpool . mignolet -_-
everton should level up already
no matter what the result , mccarthy has been everton's man of the match in his first , he's been everywhere ! 
lrt my cousin who supports liverpool called joe allen a wanker for his miss lol .
if liverpool win this mingolet has been the difference
liverpool signing mignolet was an absolute god-send
 liverpool vs everton

mignolet saving liverpool's asses with some unbelievable saves .
liverpool fucking bitchin '
liverpool are playing counter attacking football but have no pace
so many missed chances in everton vs liverpool .

liverpool keeper best keeper in the league so far liverpool lead 2-1
everytime everton attack it's like 3 vs 3 .. are we definitely leading this game ?
liverpool wouldn't be anywhere near the top of the league if it wasn't for simon mignolet this season .
remember when liverpool fans thought skrtel was as good as vidic . hahahaha
everton vs liverpool match is a very amazing match !
i hate derby games ! come on liverpool !
c'mon everton .. shape up -mand
mignolet and joe allen are the reason why everton are still in it
come on everton !
everton should have level it now , come on everton .
this liverpool everton match is a great match
lukaku is not ready for big games bla bla bla . then loaning him to everton will make him suddenly ready ? lmao
can't afford to let everton hang around . studge for allen and go for the kill
come on everton üòÅ
watching liverpool everton with a mcdonalds at work üëÖ
everton will definitely pay for missing these chances . i've seen it happen many times . u spoil chances then ur opponent scores .
either my followers don‚Äôt like football at all or they like it enough to be ignoring my tweets . either way , hope wins
mignolet is having a great game , that's the 3rd time he has denied a clear goal scoring opportunity for everton
liverpool doing a huge game ! but they're wasting chances 
wasteful everton
how about you slot one of these anytime soon everton ? 
everton vs liverpool
my liverpool friend here went absolutely ape-shit after that allen miss ! made my morning . 
liverpool , with the help of phil dowd and some nice saves by mignolet , have stayed ahead .
come on everton !!!
watching the merseyside derby with korean commentary . don't understand a word of it , but when someone nears the goal , announcers go nuts .
mignolet man of the match without any doubt 
everton are a highly talented , well drilled side . not today , but they'll do well , great job from bobby martinz up there
i am thinking if allen is that good to play at liverpool
liverpool have got an absolute bargain in mignolet 
everton has been unlucky o .
 : save !!! mignolet rescues liverpool again by saving lukaku's shot with his right arm ... everton still looking for an equaliser
i'm guessing it's until a liverpool is killed before phil dowd will take action -___-
everton is throwing this away !
liverpool score one more please .
liverpool kill this match off and give mignolet some breathing space !
keeper saving liverpool ass each game
 has been producing chance after chance but mignolet has been extremely sharp in net . 
everton counter attack soo fast jed !
liverpool giving too much ball away .
tbh it was a wrong move for jose to actually loan out lukaku to everton
come on everton what are youse doingüò©üôè
how great is to see with a real goalkeeper 
my hatred for liverpool can't be expressed in a tweet 
the everton fans at goodison park are so noisy that i've got to turn down the volume of my tv ! 
skrtel has returned to the liverpool fold , and made the position his own . 
love watching liverpool this season so much better than last season
in the pub watching the liverpool game with the two ste's

this merseyside derby is quite dirty innit
65 ' everton mounts more pressure for an equalizer as the time winds down ...
this is one hell of a merseyside derby so far !
liverpool keeper is saving them
joe allen is world class remember :/ ??? liverpool ?: /////
this merseyside derby is a turning into a bit of a 
minyooleh is on form today . liverpool would have conceded lyk 4 goals by now
for saying liverpool have so many supposedly world class players , it really is strange that they aren't even in the europa league
watching liverpool vs everton .... tense
liverpool 2 - 1 everton good save . mignolet ! 
come on everton ffs
at what point is dowd going to reveal an everton shirt under that yellow ?
mignolet to liverpool's rescue again
top of the table :d 
joe allen would fit right in the everton team . they can't do 1 on 1s either ! 
last chance to lump on liverpool winners at 1.4 chooooochhooooo 1.01 train
everton are wasting some serious chances against looserpool 4goals
regarde everton liverpool !
merseyside derby is a half decent watch today ! some dirty business though !
swear dowd is reffing for everton .
don't understand why sakho isn't playing for liverpool ?! 
that everton pricks all late challenges
watching the merseyside derby in an awesome mexican bar
watching everton vs . liverpool ! let's go liverpool !!! ‚öΩÔ∏è 
lucky you liverpool have a good keeper .
liverpool look really nervous big holes in defence , everton better team 
how many fouls are everton allowed to do before they get booked ?
everton are wasting . you can take these fvcking scousers c'mon!
suarez scored a wonderful free kick !! 
everton is trying too hard to tie it up
oh my . everton is trying to kill suarez ? keep bringing him down .
come on everton !
is dowd afraid to book everton players ?
put sturridge on now whilst everton have this pressure , his pace will , drop them deeper .
merseyside derby is so quiet it's like being in church ..!!
c'mon reds ! merseyside is red . porno is blue .
everton is so dirty
everton starting to play the channels now for lukaku and gerrard . not so reliant on left flank .
liverpool could've made it 3 . it was a good assist from suarez and a fantastic miss from the striker .
 poor 2nd half continues . has been the difference btn equalizer 
everton fans are the angry mob . blatant fouls being committed and they're furious
mongulet keeping liverpool in this . he's had a lot of practice throughout his career though to be fair 
distin is a liability for should have left the club years ago
there is a goal here for everton
why am i up so early watching a liverpool game ?
i hope everton can punish liverpool for not scoring
if suarez had done that to mirallas , he'd get a lifetime ban . 
and that's why it's the merseyside derby
so liverpool takat ni yang control game , ahahaha why me look at this channel ...
it's going to be really frustrating when liverpool dont won't this game after that miss ..
liverpool just cant keep the ball
 would be leading now if they had taken their chances .... 
merseyside derby forever exciting and dramatic
everton liverpool
so mirrilas draws blood twice from two different liverpool players ? good refereeing there dowd !
such an open game this . everton slightly on top .
everton to score next . sitting back too much
although it was while liverpool were losing the run of a game so i can see why .
how many fouls to everton have to commit before a card comes out ????
it would be amazing if i can watch the premier league with english girls . watching liverpool matches with a liverpool girl , etc ..
in the world there are manywelsh wonderkids , madrid=bale , arsenal=ramsey and liverpool have someone better than that 
game is too stretched . liverpool lose the ball and in seconds we are making a saving tackle . midfield need to get a grip in the game .
simon mignolet = 's best signing last 2 years ..
liverpool still come back to score# 2-1 everton
come on everton just 1 more goal for the draw
everton are trying to kill suarez
liverpool are so lucky to be winning this everton should be up
everton have a quality team , lukaku , barry , mccarthy , baines , coleman . would be surprised if they don't get europa this year
so happy mignolet is liverpool keeper , making brilliant saves and keeping us in the game ! top notch keeper ! always admired him !
i've said it already and i'm going to say it again mignolet is liverpool's savior this season
hahahaha ! my small sister would have scored that .. 
liverpool keeper has kept them in lead . having a great game mignolet . 
towers !!!......... lucas and skrtl have been very impressive for liverpool it must be said
mourinho shouldn't have lones lukaku to everton . this guy is beast

brilliant save by simon mignolet . this liverpool side is so incredible . go for it reds . 
don't know much about football but does liverpool usually score goals ?
we're getting pounded . we need to make a change . everton much more physical . we need to crack someone . 
everton attacking a lot . bet joe wishes he slotted it in the back of the net earlier .
wish i went home this weekend instead of next because then i'd be able to watch liverpool vs everton on bt sport while watching the rugby
afternoon watching the liverpool vs everton derby in the village inn 
who scored in the liverpool match ?
we need sakho sakho sakho .. fucking head butt every everton player on the field .
joe allen is so shit i don't know how liverpool paid ¬£15 million for him !!
common everton !
everton getting away with murder
c'mon liverpool 
only 2 more goals everton , 0 more goal loserpool
bring on arouna kone everton . that outta help .
this liverpool vs everton game is getting intense üòÅ
everton are extremely limited in attack , in terms of lukaku's and barkley's limited cognitive capacity . no understanding of the game .
suarez has been battered by everton today and he keeps on coming !
everton , just dirty everton you'll bring us down for ever and a day ......
come on everton
everton are just after suarez ! 
 liverpool vs everton
let's go everton

everton attacking non stop .
go go go liverpool , you'll never walk alone
 it should be 3-1 with 30 minutes to go . 
another superb save by mignolet , denying lukaku .. boy he has been terrific this season for liverpool 
mignolet has kept liverpool in this 
everton just want suarez legs on a plate
so many missed chances . get a goal , everton !
mignolet has been liverpool's man of the match here
liverpool should be winning 3-1
no contact on suarez there . frustrating for everton ,
a good sign that i'm hungover is when i'm wondering why it's not an everton penalty for handball when the liverpool keeper made a save .
everything is a yellow card according to michael owen , unless you're liverpool .
merseyside derby ? how the fuck did i forget about this
everton's tactic against suarez foul him and hope for the best
dear everton , please win this derby .
seriously everton passing is like shit .
suarez has more ability than everton's entire team , hence why theyre turning sunday league on him hahaha 
meanwhile liverpool is leading everton 2 1 at goodison park
suarez diving again , gerrard getting away with everything c'mon everton
ref being really nice to everton today .
don't worry liverpool fans , i've got 2-2 at 14/1 so that means everton will not score again .

we need to get the ball and keep it . everton controlling at the moment .
 liverfool vs everton 2-1
the everton tactic is clearly to kick the crap out of suarez
the problem with liverpool is they buy players with one good season in the league .
yet , same for liverpool to find that killer goal .
1 former city player on the pitch for efc and 1 loanee in the merseyside derby . 2 former players on the bench for lfc ! 
the finishing from everton has been absolutely underwhelming , especially from lukaku
everton are playing so dirty it's ridiculous there just all marking suarez he's gunna go off in bits
liverpool are definite challengers for top four spot . 
everton need to score !!! üò†
lily allen would have scored that 
liverpool score another pls
liverpool win just a small matter .
come on everton !
you have to hand it to suarez , the guy is tough . pretty sure the entire everton squad has taken a swipe at him .
mignolet superman !

suarez needs to leave liverpool and go to either real madrid or chelsea
well i'm gonna win 33p cause it's a rush i could win ¬£ 1.33 if liverpool win . woooo
di bully trs liverpool sama everton -_- come on liverpool !
liverpool's defence has been really organised

i should buy liverpool jersey t.t
tbh liverpool deserve to win ..
reds are winning against everton 1-2 .. come on ! 
okay , i think everton deserve a draw here ... especially after allen's miraculous miss .
liverpool what's happening ??? its not rugby ooo
everton has looked good at times
liverpool have done nothing in open play barring allens shocking miss . ridiculous that we aren't in front
this ref is incredible . giving everything the everton crowd ask for . while sucking off miralles . bent twat
watch the rest of the everton liverpool game now
liverpool will always give you a reason to smile
everytime an everton player goes down he gives a free kick what the fuck is he on
c'mon everton !
comon everton
go head everton you soft cunts !!!
this ref supports everton . so obvious .
liverpool v everton looked a proper decent game . had to cut the viewing short to attend the real football . 
why does have to scream like a wasp-stung brownie when he gets challenged ? fecking pansy . 
everton should av equalised
man liverpool's living a little dangerously right now . sort it out .
c'mon liverpool ! let's fucking have this !!

a lot of bedwetting over hooiveld starting . did he not play in wins over city , liverpool and chelsea last season ? 
everton keep the ball very well , that reflects awfully on david moyes .
allen denied us a win with that miss .... everton will come back 
everton should equalise !!!!

come on everton , make a 
this merseyside derby is mad !! comon liverpooooool
i'm sure lucas gets a yellow card every liverpool game

liverpool trending wottt
everton should equalize on time biko
everton playing so well , missed 2 great chances !!
everton pressing all over pitch . it's working quite well against liverpool's intricacy .
come on everton
it's not a liverpool game without a lucas yellow card .
book liverpool players for nothing don't book everton players for murder well done phil dowd
ffs ! is dowd on everton's payroll ?
joe allen must be the most disappointing signing liverpool have ever made !
keep solid liverpool . a free kick coming up
bring sturridge on everton will get something from the game
liverpool fucking robbed us of migs , 9 million was a bloody bargain . well worth more than that
since when did mignolet go to liverpool ??
if liverpool win this game im gonna put a bet on them to win the title , why not ' ey ?
aah ... come on now everton ! 
hope i don't eat my words about lucas now ... 
joe allen spurns a clear-cut chance to make it 3-1 to liverpool , sliding the ball wide from only 10 yards out .
what a game between liverpool and everton
liverpool i swesr god you are lucky 
everton are quicker all over the pitch . tellingly , they're also stupider
that's a fucking tame yellow card you fat fucking cunt phil dowd , hope you drown in everton semen you cunt

anyone remember that being liverpool programme on channel 5 ? god that was cringy ...
everton is pressing and missing chances but lfc still has the lead . 
come on everton !!!
haul allen off , move henderson inside and bring on sterling to shore up the centre and push everton back or risk breakaways at pace , surely ?
joe allen missing that means he still hasn't scored for liverpool in the leagueüôà
we need to step it up . if we continue sitting back everton will score .

why is phil dowd never booking the everton players ! 
haha i'd almost forgotten liverpool bought allen and henderson . hahahahaha
the last two cards liverpool have gotten have been deserved‚Ä¶which only shows how dumb it was that mirallas only got a yellow earlier .
victor moses to come on for liverpool .
that ref's a everton fan a hink hes giving them everything the useless bastert !
' 67 yellow card : lucas leiva Óôñmirallas ' 8Óôñeverton 1-2 liverpoolÓôñcoutinho ' 5 ; su√°rez ' 19Óôñ #221stmerseysidederby
our defence ( including mignolet ) has made lukaku look like just another average everton player .
look de rudeboi fuh liverpool ! dan !
phil dowd starting to flap 
this is liverpool a year . i need liverpool to win especially since derrick rose is hurt
everton deserves at least a point from this game .
67min . lucas received a yellow card . everton has a free kick .
67mins gone and still everton 1 liverpool 2 as lucas gets booked for a foul on south africa's steven pienaar .
seriously if reina was at liverpool the amount of goals we would have conceded so far this season would of been ridiculous , mignolet is justüëå
mignolet saving liverpool for the 5th game this season . looks like their most important player haha
my dad is screaming " you dickhead " at the tv üòÇ this is new liverpool vs . everton
liverpool and everton are going at it
mignolet is really after keeping liverpool in the game 
everton should be level ... mignolet has saved liverpool today !!!
moses on for joe allen . his pace and strength will cause more trouble for everton than allen's feeble football player impersonation .
liverpool still winning !
i don't think liverpool need reina again
go liverpool !!!!!!
haziq should stop supporting everton
moses is coming on for liverpool hopefully allen is going off
suarez should be taken out the everton players are trying to injure him 
literally despise everton fans , horrible
so annoyed !!! everton can go fuck themselves !!!!
woah liverpool winning with sas(sturridge and in form sakho ) pm the bench
liverpool's defence has been well organised throughout the match
our best winger is on for liverpool 
how has everton only had two yellow cards so far ?
moses to come on for liverpool . 
liverpool !
shite , did liverpool win ?
everton threatening to equalize . 
... feels a lot like old liverpool , getting it to suarez and hoping he does something with it . not the way we want to play .
everton are proper girls , grow some balls the shit heads
be amazed if everton don't nick a point .
a well deserve yellow card to leiva lucas of liverpool
wouldn't be a liverpool match without a lucas yellow card
liverpool , never drink alone !!!!!!
phil dowd why do you support everton ? miserable life awaits
el liverpool necesita que entre sturridge ya !
i don't know what happens to liverpool defending after the second half . 
did liverpool won ? please tell me they did .
everton deserve at least a draw so far
everton using suarez as the football ... score stands@ 1-2 to liverpool .... 20 minutes to go
come on everton
everton deserves to score
victor moses coming on for liverpool and joe allen coming off .
this merseyside derby ... dammit ! 
even if liverpool win this il always remember this game for that joe allen miss .
nik postinger is a liverpool fan isnt he ?
who says liverpool can't win d title
huddersfield concede a last minute goal but hold on to win 1-2 ! that's half of the early double landed !! lets hope liverpool hold on !
i want everton to win
everton can't keep up with suarez so they are just trying their best to injury him "
having a good keeper might be the change liverpool needed since tho 
 getting saved by the ref again and again .: @ he should've been sent off at least 30 minutes ago . still he's on the pitch . 
anytgng interesting happening in the everton liverpool game ?
it has been long since i watched liverpool match shea
lmao everton are very stupid
this ref is so biased for everton
it looks like alar bet d yaris on liverpool today
how is it 2 yellows apiece ? everton have liked anything that's moved second half
feel sorry for joe allen - if liverpool don't win a lot of people will blame him ..
suarez is on fiiiiiiiiirreee !!!!!!! fantasy points pap ! # liverpool fc
thank god allen is coming off , the biggest dickhead to wear a liverpool shirt .
come on everton get back ! :d 
come on liverpool !
joe allen gets the shepherd's crook just minutes after being outwitted by the everton goalposts 
i'd love to see southampton beat arsenal , as long as liverpool win first that is .
nice set piece there everton
i think liverpool's bench is better than the starting line-up haha
come on everton
i'd hate suarez if he was playing against liverpool .
selena mackay is looking for cameramen and sound recordists manchester/liverpool based . email details to : selena.mackay.co.uk
liverpool need an injection of pace up front for these counter attacks . moses ... thought so
just seen a fella in an everton shirt coming home from b&m with his wife clearly she put her foot down today 
how fast the yellow card is issued to reds .. if everton's assault on reds ... sooooooo slow or even worse , no card at all !!!
i'm no football manager , but when it's a tight game and everton are threatening , why would you bring on a purely attacking minded winger
fuck off liverpool !!!!!!!!
22 minutes to go plus stoppage time . still 2-1 to liverpool , no goals in the second half . sturridge still on the bench .
victor moses getting ready to come on for liverpool . 
everton vs liverpool live .......
liverpool to me is like shalke04 . they have the players but lack so much .
how many chances do everton want !!!! lukaku showing why he will never be a top player !
liverpool would have been behind in this game , if it was to be pepe reina on goal .
liverpool vs everton
another poor yellow considering some of the everton tackles that have gone unpunished .
good free kick , everton . really good .
i'm late ! liverpool against everton .

everton and these hail mary shots
mignolet on fire . come on liverpool !!

everton has no game plans ...
everton's short set piece routines are dreadful . they scored their goal from a free-kick into the box ... put it in the mixer !!!
moses for alien .... liverpool is in for an attacking approach
that was a brilliantly executed fk by everton ... not ! 
watching liverpool vs everton to win . ( man u fan )
the liverpool vs everton game is intense 
dang it time warner cable .. why did you choose to go out in the middle of a liverpool game
after keeping mirallas on through so much , dowd can't send a liverpool player off for anything less than a broken bone
can't believe everton started with hashim amla as goalkeeper 
haha everton fans prolly clapping cos of his miss
liverpool why is sturridge not in the start
everton are all over liverpool the shit cunts
feelin heavy tense cos a need liverpool win but ma bt sports no up yet , pub is callingg

phil dowd should never referee in the premier league again never mind a merseyside derby . fat useless prick . 
starboy in for liverpool , moses !
laughing so hard that everton lost 
liverpool sitting very deep now . maybe moses will bring more dynamism on the counter .
piss poor finishing from everton
mane lagi goal liverpool
what makes for an exciting match ? either liverpool or everton can score next . flow of game providing chances for both teams . mignolet huge
moses in allen out 
ffs sometimes being direct works . show some urgency everton 
so far the merseyside has been a good one . great goal keeping by mignolet !
 playing good game !! the boy has too much to give 
liverpool is now 11 players on the pitch after the alien was replaced by victor moses
every time everton get the ball liverpool just start hacking them . typical .
and with that , joe allen's liverpool career ends .
everton will be disappointed if they end without a point !
victor moses will be our first substitution ¬†and i said kicking off 
allen-out moses-in 
here comes victor moses on as a sub for liverpool - could he make a final bid for bbc african footballer of the year with a goal ? 
come on you everton
everton are fucking shit
aaaargh everton are frustrating me right now .. they have the quality , just making stupid mistakes !
everton midfielders ' plan of " blasting from long distance instead of trying to find big striker " is not working ...
everton fans are fuckin boring all they sing is everton everton evertonn
#2pl phil doubt liverpool will win ?
joe allen has been everton's best player today . ‚Äù
liverpool vs mancity , or its moses vs jesus üòÇüòÇüòÇ
watching merseyside derby starting to revise my view on mourinho's decision to let lukaku go out on loan
everton are fcuked , no free kick taker no corner kick taker , just playing like a pulis alehouse ream
arsenal really need to win to stay on top if liverpool win ! but then again we got a great bench alongside an awesome squad playing today ! üëåüôè
everton 1 vs 2 liverpool
ref might aswell have an everton shirt on !! !!
vamos liverpool
everton don't really have a patient build up in their game . defense to midfield- to the wingers- shoot/cross
moses no liverpool como assim ?
in terms of the technique , touch & skill of the players on show , this is the classiest merseyside derby in years ...
in : victor moses out : joe allen 
everton players really struggling to score an easy goal
allens put in a good shift , been everywhere . motm i reckon . liverpool will win the league with this amazing squad .

the welsh xavi has been taken off before he embarrasses everton more than he already has 
i want a draw , come on everton
 1 # liverpool 2

may the gods of football grant liverpool and everton a draw

69 ' allen off , mosses on everton 1-2 liverpool
because of moses i want liverpool to draw not lose

liverpool's defending has been fantastic , defending deep , shielding the area to a t .
all-time record : tim howard becomes the only player in the history of everton to start 272 premier league games ( david unsworth = 271) ."
lukaku should score for everton and moses should make sure liverpool dont score again . win win for chelsea .

everton's no . 10 misses a great opportunity . so does joe allen . torres everywhere :d 
can't wait to get to liverpool

all liverpool's goals this season were scored by sturridge , receive the crown of life , ~ bible
i have a feeling everton will score
jogo com cara de empate ! 
liverpool could win the premier league this year , it's gonna be interesting !
good call rodgers üòâ . moses on the break should keep everton honest .
mignolet has been a beast for liverpool . everton should be winning this
everton finishing pretty poor !
everton deserve a draw
everton should just stop now because they aren't getting past mignolet
everton will snatch a draw surely ...
it's coming for everton .
stupid stupid everton ... can't finish
everton couldn't score in a brothel
saturday mornin football . come on everton u need to atleast pull out a draw
flanagan has 11 everton players in his back pocket 
joe allen his absolute shit , doesn't deserve to wear a liverpool jersey , thankgod moses is on now
mignolet as usual saving liverpool
o time do liverpool ta pica
simon mignolet saves liverpool's ass . again , again & again ..
mignolet is keeping everton at the bay
everton are starting to piss me off , just fucking score .
liverpool's passing has been way off today . good to win ugly if we can hold out 
mingolet ........ good signing for liverpool this season .... i still miss pepe reina though
lucky liverpool ..
mignolet is class . he gets a lot of help from everton strikers , but he‚Äôs done all the right things so far .
how have everton only scored one . they're all over us
63 mins liverpool still leading
am i the online one watching liverpool vs everton ?
come on everton need you to score otherwise my coupon is fucked already
mignolet , the great wall of liverpool .
69 ' liverpool sub : allen out , moses in . 
liverpool should of killed this game of with that joe allen chance .
everton are wasting their chances to score . the attackers need to work on their ' finishing '.
liverpool are really luck still to be leading !!
dear jesus ... thank you for making everton switch that updated crest at the end of this season . with liberty and justice for all . amen .
do liverpool have any away support cant hear fuck all out of them haha 
why are everton players not releasing the ball quickly
c'mon liverpool , make good use of chances and score the winning goal ..
good play liverpool .. especially mignolet ... good saves ..
come on everton
and hopefully , as i am on my way to the oval , the merseyside derby will stay as it is ...
link to the liverpool match ?
will liverpool keep this lead
mignolet having a spectacular second half so far , although everton could probably have done better with a couple of chances .
this merseyside derby na war o ... kilodede ?
no jerome thomas today , as groin problem keeps him out . shame . he worked hard/did well v everton last weekend . 
mignolet's keeping liverpool in this one !
just score everton
after missing the first five games due to suspension . has become top scorer so far this season with 9 goals 
sub : 68 ' moses on , allen off . everton 1 - 2 liverpool
 almost saves 2 goals for . one of his best displays for while misses a sitter . great derby on play .
everton shots are as if they never had shooting practice before
a lil unselfishness from everton lads and they can turn this game to their favour
no one has been better than barkley today in the merseyside derby
liverpool haters are tired of mignolet
you know everton , there's this rectangular thing at the end of the pitch called a goal . perhaps you would like to try a get the ball in it ?
game has all the markings of a late everton equalizer .
if you give them enough chances , even everton will score . let's close them down before they get the chance , eh ?
 
if liverpool wins it's all down to mignolet .
liverpool are much better this season to what they were last season
how many chances should midfield create for their strikers to score ?
c'mon everton ... make something happen !!
come on liverpool !!
blame it on lukaku just in case everton fails to get atleast a draw
everton vs liverpool damn exciting can !
mignolet keeping liverpool in this
important game for arsenal a win restores the 2 point gap at the top . liverpool currently top by a point but arsenal have a game in hand
liverpool should just kill this game off
lukaku with another chance . great save mignolet . still everton 1 liverpool 2 #70mins gone .
everton i need a draw please
how many chances do everton want
liverpool gk has been very good
why have i just seen someone in a liverpool shirt with david guetta printed on the back . feel ill
everton look certain to score .... look how they play at such aggressive tempo
dear lord !... please let liverpool win this match ... everton are the cheat ... always committing an offence ... 
i don't need a boyfriend to make my heart skip a beat . i have liverpool :')
this liverpool keeper is

difference between arsenal and liverpool , their welsh midfielder can score 
i can't take anything away from mignlolet but everton shot were aimed at him .
nerves are gone here üò´ everton well on top
can't believe everton hasn't scored a second goal . so many chances .
everton players making mignolet a hero . not taking anything away from him though .
partidazo el everton - liverpool !!! 
everton v liverpool is happening and the pub is showing a dire 0-0 between st mirren and hibs 
cracking match now everton v liverpool !
everton are making flanagan look like lahm ffs .
lukaku should of done better 
this is maddening , cmon everton !!
liverpool really lucky
liverpool's defense has been so poor that mignolet stands out .
can't see liverpool hanging on here . some dreadful defending as jockey would say ......
how have everton not scored this half ?
mignolet is why everton won't win this . he's been unbelievable today .
ask positive and powerful questions and allow your mind to find the answer , well done southampton , man city , liverpool
can't wait for everton's equaliser :(
lol listening to live radio commentary of the merseyside derby , liverpool up 2-1 fucking stressful ...
mignolet keeping liverpool in the game singlehandedly
mignolet with multiple nice stops today , liverpool with the clear advantage there today
these everton players r tryin there hardest for suarez to react
come on everton
 vs really is the best derby game in the premiership ! not many games are this good in a season , 
everton have got to score soon
can't find a pub accepting of united fans ... 
been informed everton are singing ' allez allez '. " from li-ver-pooool " wont sound as good ..

liverpool 2-1 up but mignolet is their man of the match 24 
lukaku again wtf everton una no get sense
dunno why i didn't do the wednesday and everton game as goals galore
mignolet has saved liverpool in the second half ! 
this everton team is very good . very quick , strong , commited
martinez is gonna be pissed if everton don't at least get a draw out of this ... wasting a lot of possession & chances ..
everton . please make a comeback .
i rate reina a lot , however should he move to barca , liverpool will cope just fine
70 ' mignolet preserves liverpool's lead with another brilliant save ...
danny agger being toyed around by the front line of everton . ha .
i honestly want liverpool get beat though . a use sturridge on the bench
liverpool fans crying about mirallas , don't you remember last year when suarez wasn't sent off after studding 3 people ?
everton 1 - 2 liverpool
c'mon everton . if liverpool win this i have to go another week without looking at the league table ! 
my dad is like cursing the shit out of everton right now üòÇüòÇüòÇ
has the everton tanoy tried making all the fans in the ground sit down yet or are they allowing it cuz its a derby
sub joe allen , who missed a great chance for liverpool a moment ago , is replaced by victor moses . everton 1-2 liverpool ( 69 mins ) 
lukaku should be burying them .. getting into good positions and making those runs .. needs to make it count .. can see everton scoring ..
everton have had some great chances . they really need to bag one of them soon .
simon mignolet will be liverpool motm .
watching liverpool vs everton 
liverpool needs to stop losing the ball !!
sat in a play centre instead of watching liverpool v everton
everton playing better football geez
i want liverpool to draw and southampton to win üôè and all the rest to lose or draw
so is barkley like everton has quality players
you can see that everton will score . need the third goal to kill of the game 
mignolet has got his positioning spot on today , but you have to wonder why the everton players have been shooting straight at him .
mistake after mistake being made by the liverpool defense . need to stay composed
liverpool just trying to find ways to let everton back in the game
mignolet dey save liverpool
everton has a freekick more or less the same place where suarez scored 
come on everton
all these ibo liverpool fans no wan lemme hear wetin commentator dey talk sh* .
i honestly can't see why everton spent so much money on james mccarthy .
everton should be back in this .. mignolet different class
liverpool play the most boring , least creative midfield i've ever witnessed yet still win games
everton are trying to over-complicate it a tad in that final third , no ?
we need to get the fuck out . too fucking deep liverpool .
all everton at the moment , but fancy liverpool might nick a goal on the break 
liverpool living dangerously
everton looking very dangerous now , goal looks like it's coming .
 
liverpool need to kill this game
c'mon liverpool we need another goal here 
baines : miss me everton ? :d
liverpool getting sloppy we need to bring on sturridge 
not happy with all these free kicks liverpool keep conceding
the red devils shouldn't consider liverpool as arch enemy because without them lending help after munich aircrash , mu would be relegated
everton deserve something out of this . mignolet keeping lfc in the game .
barkley is a baller needs to give it though . lucas is liverpool's flamini , proper important for them
get a grip liverpool
liverpool's defence without toure and sakho is shocking today 
mignolet keeping liverpool in this . joe allen keeping everton in it .
liverpool ! focus !!!
everton knocking on the door , lots of pressure
everton deserve to win this ...
liverpool !!!
the commentators and referee clearly supporting everton today . 
 free kick for everton
merseyside on fire at 1 2
only on radio commentary but wtf ! put your fucking on ffs ....... 
everton deserve a draw to say the least , too much effort wasted
my hearts telling me we can see out this win , but my heads telling me there is an equaliser for everton coming ..
hey everton try shooting at goal away from the keeper .
70 mins gone 1 - 2 - everton have a free kick now .

how has lucas not been booked ? the barry of liverpool
in this case . liverpool might be draw : 0
merseyside is blue ! haha .
how many chances do everton need ?! would love jelavic to come on and score a couple 
i'm backing everton cos of lukaku 
o ship free kick to everton 
everton are pissing me off
everton have a solid squad . they just need someone loke fergie to bring the best out of them
the way that liverpool's defending is really frustrating to watch .
johnson and gerrard the worst liverpool players today for me . two of our key players .
mignolet is liverpool .
this match is crazy . liverpool should have 4 or 5 goals . hoping everton can make them pay . lukaku is starting to look dangerous ... 
obviously this second commentator is a liverpool supporter
liverpool is the . arsenal fan .
everton deserve win !
too much cheap ball given away from liverpool in midfield .
everton cutting through our midfield too easily .
eyyyyyyy everton letting the reds win only
when ? reply #2002 #2006 or #2007 ? everton beat liverpool 3-0 .. while justin timberlake topped the charts with " sexyback "
everton brought the game to liverpool .... lfc needs to score two more goals to bury the game .
i'm neither supporting nor hating everton and liverpool so i hope its a draw üòé
everton having no problem opening liverpool up but they can't put it away
everton must score
mignolet superb right now . 2-1 liverpool 70 '
fuck you mignolet ! let everton score you prick !
liverpool don't deserve this if they win , they've been rubbish
lukaku is a beast upfront . his movement so far has been absolutely brilliant . getting closer and closer to liverpool goal .
a 3rd goal will do . come on you liverpool . 
suarez's free kick goal was amazing . tim howard still almost got it . liverpool still up 2-1 on everton .
if liverpool don't win joe allen should be shot
everton should have scored three goals , lukaku's being a waste
barkley from everton kind of looks like blake griffin 
nz just gone ahead , lpool 2-1 up at everton allen misses sitter , i've just ironed shirt & two pair trousers , all happening on super saturday
liverpool keeper too nicee
everton will equalise eventually . come on .
when ? reply #2006 #2007 or #2008 ? liverpool beat wigan 4-0 .. while take that topped the charts with " patience "
these faggot everton players üò°
liverpool probably resting sturridge for their mid week european game .... oh wait ... .
oh liverpool is wonderfull !
everton all over lfc in the last 10 minutes but still no equalizer .

alllll everton . so expect a liverpool goal on the break . 
liverpool has one sick goalkeeper .
everton is bad today . just bad .
i know i am a gooner but honestly to be fair to liverpool , everton is playing the bully . suarez is very good . mignolet , excellent .
what has the merseyside derby turned into ? 95% of all the players are faggots .
liverpool defenders have been immense today . kept lukaku relatively quiet , and that's not an easy job for any defender .
liverpool getting sloppy , everton getting in behind at will .. goal is coming 
free kick for everton :)
lucas has done well breaking up everton's moves today .
suarez is too good for liverpool
mignolet is playing a fantastic game today . 
come on luh liverpool ! score one more ! üôèüôèüôèüôè
stop f*****g around over there ! 
liverpool looking shaky
liverpool are going to be the cause of my death i just know it 
the way i see it , liverpool's best players are much better than everton's; but everton look like a better team . 
our player moses can score third goal against everton
everton deserves at least a point in this game ... 
liverpool , don't let everton score this
why is liverpool making this so difficult now ... keep the ball .
free kick for everton . i'm not going to breathe .

everton could rue all these missed chances at the end ....
imagine the scoreline had pepe reina been in goal for liverpool today ... üòÇüòÇ

phil dowd has been the best player on the field for everton today
lukaku should have a hat-trick by now but the liverpool keeper aint giving him room
liverpool being raped
liverpool have no depth at all ! arsenal have more depth than them this season ..
rosicky could get into this liverpool xi and be the best midfielder there

just thankful that liverpool is winning
liverpool are playing so well 
been very poor in 2nd half here ! everton better team need to keep ball high up the pitch ..... counter attack after counter
everton getting through centre of midfield too easily . lucas giving them free kick after free quick , sure to be punished soon

good save by mignolet from the freekick , everton did well not to rush the chance .
always have been an everton fan 
the way i'm celebrating everton's goal you'd think i was a toffee
mignolet's been excellent though , did everything he possibly could to keep liverpool ahead
lukaku is a sick striker everton derserve to win
luck just ran out for mignolet , the belgian finally strikes . everton 2-2 liverpool
the 3 belgians are making the headlines at merseyside
liverpool 2-2 everton , wonderful
i hope joe allen remember if this game ends as a draw or and everton wins its entirely his fault !

the way everton recycle the ball though ...
lukaku you little beauty , come on everton . great composure . .

game should already be out of sight , typical liverpool
fml neverton 2 - 2 liverpool fc 
does joe allen want to destroy liverpool our what's going on ?
goal ! lukaku and everton deserved this point . mignolet was brilliant tonight no matter what this game will end at .

frustrating to concede that equalizer , liverpool just not playing well enough today at all in my opinion .
everton 2 - 2 liverpool
that number 11 for everton did a great job bow down to him
come on everton . put these reds down .
merseyside darby hot !!!!
have everton just win the league ? went out the room for a sec and when it came in it looked like they had 
everton must win .. its their own ground though .
everton back on level terms . romelu lukaku what a goal !

cmon everton !!!!
phil dowd goal for everton
mourinho you idiot . look at what lukaku is doing for everton , and tell me which chelsea striker you kept has more goals than him ? mxm .
calling a mirallas winner . would be funny to see how liverpool react .
what a game everton - liverpool . pretty fucking intense
everton 2-2 liverpool 73mins .
liverpool can't keep depending on mignolet and suarez
so long liverpool ;)
that was so unfortunate , still fancy liverpool to win , though !
liverpool for real
kemon toffes yu kan du it 
loving it . liverpool fans blaming their one and only 
excellent team play from everton .
keep it up everton
liverpool never dealt with the free kick properly and an industrious lukaku made them pay .
everton have played well and deserved a 2nd goal but the score should be 3-2 due to allen's horror miss . 
everton managing the rare feat of not just shooting from any angle when the keeper is off his line/out of his goal
everton vs liverpool ---- hot hot hot that's y i love the bpl just classy
 : goal !! everton 2-2 liverpool . romelu lukaku's low finish brings everton level again .
lovely goal from everton . he's been quite quiet by his usual standards today lukaku but he wasn't going to miss that !
where the hell did all these everton fans pop up from 
everton 2-2 liverpool ynwa <333 cmon liverpool
mignolet has got to be annoyed . only so many times he can keep everton out . defence need to fix up . 
but liverpool goalkeeper is pretty awesome
now win it 
deserved goal for everton , they've been far superior since the break
so dad only manage to realise that i am hoping for liverpool to lose . so slow . lol
the zip had gone from liverpool's movement . that goal was coming . 
nice ar everton ..!!
ohhhh ! what a goal ! .. gol de everton ! lukaku scored an equalizer goal ! 2-2
please liverpool
liverpool don't deserve anything from this

apart from suarez there is no difference between everton and liverpool
lukaku is the one that got away , everton to go on and win it now
everton should have gone down to 10 in the first half & the game should have been over long ago sick of referee's going against suarez 
as much as i'm a closet everton fan , mignolet is quality
aah shit , worst time to concede . we are playing poor , everton with all the momentum and 20 mins to get a winner . need to hold out here .

soon as allen missed that chance i knew everton would equalize , complete giveaway ... not over yet though . 
everton with the deserved equalizer ! lukaku wasn't going to be denied the whole game .
mignolet's saved liverpool way too many times today . my man of the match so far .
cracking match . merseyside derby is the real .
wake up liverpool
we gotta score common redmen 
the merseyside derby never disappoints .
mignolet's earlier saves could be the difference between a draw and loss for liverpool .
can still see liverpool nicking this
go on everton
defensively liverpool just don't quite cut it !!!
chelsea dumb once again for loaning out lukaku , everton smart for scooping him up . 
i hope joe allen feels really shit about that everton goal
 is not a small team anymore ! or maybe i was dead wrong !
everton will win though
one more goal everton
goal everton 2-2 liverpool ( 72 mins ) romelu lukaku brings everton level with a precise finish from inside the area "
lukaku is a best ! everton 2-2 liverpoopl yipee !!!!!! :-p
why are liverpool so fucking shit in the 2nd half of every fucking game ?
only so much mignolet could do to stop lukaku . giving everton too many opportunities and been punished for it .
celebrating an everton goal is one thing bit celebrating an everton goal in the derby is on a whole different level ! 
come on liverpool , get another goal , don't give up ‚ù§Ô∏è
can see everton winning this
watching everton v . liverpool premier soccor league #17 scores tied .... crowd a huge form on screen in here am . dona
everton will be disappointed to draw/lose this . so many missed chances .
damn it , like seriously i need another goal from liverpool ! - . -
the man of the hour lukaku scores for everton to level things up ! did the belgian beast do it for me though ?!
been all everton second half apart from the joe allen comedy
everton 2 2 liverpool
beg everton win one more goal like
c'mon liverpool
beautiful football from everton , shlda watched this match from the off

" fuck yeah !" - lukaku after he knots the merseyside derby at 2 . 
everton afi get something outta this game
i hate everton
who's that amish man in nets for everton ?
to liverpool defender - " push up !" " push up !"
the dynamo is the only team me & my dad root for together . clearly he is pulling for everton while i pull for liverpool
we'll start playing now but why should it take an everton goal for us to do that ?
mirallas should be off . barkley has been guilty of diving six times . everton should be on nine men .
goal ! everton 2 2 liverpool !! 
everton might end up winning dz match
come on liverpool !
liverpool today and huddersfield later yayyyyyy

the day everton's barkley gets sent off- cue all the barkley card jokes .

mignolet man of the derby merseyside nih , haha
lukaku is on fire at everton , with the service he'll recieve at chelsea he will be easily scoring 30 a season !
if it was not mignolet idk how liverpool can survive now
i would ask why liverpool are so shit but no point
2-2 now ffs , but come on liverpool !
good to see not a lot of fans in this pub !
screaming lukaku like i'm an everton fan . vested interests .
liverpool's goal keeper is one of the best in if not the best
i bet you everton will win this at the last minute ...
liverpool would go top of the table if they win .
this merseyside derby is outstanding . once again shame about michael owen on bt , but you can't have everything
is timmy howard angling for a contract from the red sox ? 
was it so hard to clear the ball there ... that goal was gifted to everton .
looks like that allen miss could cost liverpool come on you blues !
it took everton good team work to score that goal
lukaku lets get it everton ! 2-2 
enjoying liverpool vs everton
i'm so done with this game . everton is playing so freaking aggressive and referee act as if nothing is happening ???? wth
liverpool would be nothing without mignolet ! absolute shit they've played let everton attack and attack it was coming sooner either way !!!
everton have deserved that , better side most of the game .
couldn't give a fuck about liverpool
this everton vs liverpool match is epic
if games ended in ht , liverpool would be 5 points clear at the top of the table . 
merseyside is always good fun
come on everton grab the winner .
3 - romelu lukaku has scored in his last three premier league appearances against liverpool . target . 
might write a letter of complaint to liverpool over the waste of space that is joe allen who should make a public apology .
3 goals in the last 3 games for lukaku against liverpool !
come on liverpool !!
mirallas should have chopped red ! allen should have scored ! oh poor liverpool !!!
duel sengit derby merseyside broh .. mignolet onfire -__-
liverpool everton ... game on
don't be complacent la liverpool !!!!!!!!
everton have been so lucky so far !
blaming johnson for that goal . tried to be clever and gave the ball straight to everton 25 yards out immediately before free-kick conceded .
so after that build up , the news that everton and liverpool are now level at 2-2 as it finished last season . 5 players have that spot on
fair play both merseyside teams do look good this year , got a soft spot for everton and martinez though so go on lads !
phenomenal game on nbcsn right now , 2-2 its everton vs liverpool and i couldn't be happier . this is a phenomenal game .
liverpool are lukaku's bunny .
if liverpool go on to lose this game joe allen must forfeit a week's wages .

the everton loan was such a good move for deulofeu . as amazing as he already is he'll be much more prepared for the first team when hes back

ffs liverpool should have had this game wrapped up , joe allen's miss has cost us . . n.w.a.
i think if there is a winner in this game it be everton
this merseyside derby must end in a draw . 
lukaku ! ties it up !
goall everton
everton deserve a winner in my opinion .
if you want entertainment , start watching the everton vs liverpool game .... the pace , the saves , the goals .... as good as it gets .
why can't liverpool hold a lead
well deserved equaliser for everton , cracking game !
yes please keep the score a draw or an everton win ! 
liverpool loosing today ... my prediction
are everton the new manchester utd with refs in their pocket ? or is this just typical anti-liverpool bias we hoped we had seen the back of ?
can see everton winning now ! after that allen miss we been all over the place !! fix up boys !
what's going on ?!? liverpool can't keep relying on mignolet ! if joe allen scored then it would be a different story . 
liverpool has sterling still brings on moses hahahha
the moment when a scouse fan rings you and everton score during the call ... haha
i think lukaku would be better off at everton than chelsea
oh dear ... liverpool may need some defensive help eg . no flanagan !
come on everton !!!
masterclass frm everton dey deserve d goal
that was brilliant composed football by everton
i refuse to watch another liverpool game where joe allen is involved , he is a useless shite
everton leveled the score though lukaku its now 2-2 see i told u . but there is still time .

distin is one of the most consistent defenders in the premier league ! 
damn -- " everton score -- " now everton 2 - 2 liverpool , come on 
argh everton equalises by r . lukaku , 2 - 2 .
everton 2 vs 2 liverpool
2-2 in the merseyside derby would be spot on !
whoever beat mignolet to rebound and kept play alive for everton- good star . couldn't see number . that hustle play led to goal .
" everton deserve that " - right , cos goals for assaulting our best players is exactly how karma works .
such an unboring game - liverpool to sneak it i think
finally ! 2-2 
liverpool will be left to rue that missed chance by joe allen . have a feeling everton will steal this at the end .
come on liverpool , late winner please üôè
liverpool don't have the defense to win the league , but have the firepower to make a case for a champions league spot .
come on everton
mignolet has been unbelievable this match . that second everton goal was a long time coming .
this merseyside derby , a draw will be good # evevsliv
deserved goal for everton

great persistence from everton . proper derby attitude . well worked goal in a congested box . seeing lukaku reminds me i hate chelsea 
mignolet fuk up come on reds

deserved equaliser for everton 2-2 "
 your prediction everton vs liverpool comes true at 71 ".... bt liverpool will win by the 90 " +
liverpool has a reason to complain , mirallas should've been sent on in the 1st half . i'd rather say allen wastefulness compromised them .
i remember the days liverpool were the biggest club on merseyside

yaay , everton
everton should have 10 men as well .

everton's equaliser owes alot down to mirallas & the way in which he is quick to keep the ball alive off the free kick save 
everton can win

gerrard , lucas and henderson = most mediocre midfield in the league . the liverpool attack and defense is on point though .
please win this game liverpool man üò©
johnson and allen could have made it 5-2 to everton with their silly mistakes
nice job~ another goal and i'll love you . go everton !
 allen miss could prove costly . everton to maybe press for a winner ?
 everton - liverpool

why oh why is lukaku at everton and not in a blue shirt of chelsea ?
come on everton . but a draw will be great too .

yes everton
everton are on fire ...
come on liverpool enough of this bullshit !
everton from ' attacking ' to ' contain '
75 ' 2-2 .
i wonder if as many everton fans are blaming delofeu and lukaku for missing their one on ones as liverpool fans berating joe allen ..
mourinho i guess you were drunk the day you allowed lukaku go to everton ‚òπ
this is one of my favourite games so far this season . everton are relentlessly attacking liverpool .
come on everton !!!
come on liverpool !!
one more goal everton one more !

liverpool now fucking up most of my bets ...... on the other hand hahahahahaahahahahhcyxpydptdptdptxyf !!!!! fuck off you scouse twats !! üòÇ
it took like 3 years for the liverpool players to go help the goalie after he parried the ball
liverpool tolong menang please , im begging .
like i said , suspect a draw this match . everton is really good at home .
first an absolute howler of a miss by allen and then a stupid , tired foul by lucas . mistakes like this will keep liverpool out of the top 4 .
mirallas puts the ball in and shouldn't be on the pitch . more dodgy decisions at goodison going against liverpool
this liverpool-everton game is amazing
mignolet has been fantastic . everton deserved that goal . 
merseyside derby is serving up a classic ... very entertaining ...
yess ! a draw will be a fair result ! 
come on everton üôè
liverpool or everton winner ?
aha liverpool
can everton just grab the 3pts !!!
merseyside is blue , red is film !
everton refuses to loose and are determined to extend this home streak
as good as mignolet has been everton deserved that , they've gotten behind liverpools defense a lot , mignolet's been bailing liverpool out
liverpool failed to clear their lines after mignolet keeps out a powerful low drive from lukaku's freekick which led to the equalizer ...
go liverpool :)
everton are cheating scum
yes yes com on ye blues , lucky lukaku does it again com on everton everton-everton-everton oh we love u coyb-nsno-imwt-iewb-etid-batb-ftrs
i will vomit if i see allen start a game for liverpool again
gerrard og for the everton winner pls !
everton deserving this
mignolet could only save liverpool for so long 2-2 
get in ! one more now 
phil dowds been so bias toward everton
merseyside derby at its very best .... that's why i love bpl .. best league in the world
watch now hibs score and liverpool leave me and danny down the rats !!
not an everton fan , but lukaku is so much fun to watch 
with the fans behind them , everton are winning this game
once be a liverpool , you'll always be bangang
everton closing up real good
everton who should be down to 10 men celebrate the equaliser like they've won the league . happy with a point against a big club i suppose .
come on liverpool make louis happy !
we all hate derbies , so fans we understand how torturous it feels ., meanwhile 
important clearance for everton from silver dishpan 
huh liverpool üò≠
i see lukaku has scored for everton again ? businessforus 
if everton wins , southampton has to do same
aaaah liverpool . wtf are doing
i love how roberto martinez's turned this everton into , playing some top class football .
lets win it everton
fuck !! come on liverpool !!!!
come on everton !
if liverpool lose this game allen better kill himself !
allen has fucked liverpool over here ! missed a sitter
haha everton worshiping a man that is only using them to appeal better to chelsea or bigger clubs
so wento switch gen's and everton had equalized .
everton deserve to be level . liverpool have barely had a sniff in the second half 
bet liverpool fans want to decapitate allen lol
this everton y liverpool game is freaking live
i want to scream every time liverpool does something stupid but cheese would get mad at me if i had no voice

as much as united are playing some pretty disgusting football lately , i will not shy away from the fact that liverpool are a useless club

liverpool should have clinched it , but everton scored oops
i feel allen cost liverpool the derby inno
ok everton , you got 1 of the two i asked for , now the next one please to let us win 3-2

it will be harsh if everton were to lose this derby b'se everybody has put in a shift in the game .
eve 2-2 liverpool
still think liverpool have the midfield edge to do it
it was coming . dowd should be happy . now do we risk sturidge or stick . don't think br responded to everton pressure .

i'm watching the liverpool game and have missed all 4 goals ..
no mercy in the merseyside derby .
liverpool for god damn sake ! please score
merseyside derby . doubt you'll see a better game this season and it ain't over yet !
mourinho doesn't make many mistakes but the fact that the giant belgian is playing for everton and not chelsea may prove to be one of them .
minolet's flawless performance could only prevent an everton goal for so long . still plenty of time for lfc to find a winner . 
one more goal now everton ... if coleman still on , it's would be perfect if he scores ..
everton keeps falling so easily . wusses .
come on everton !
liverpool cannot win :o no !
lets go everton !!! 
merseyside derby , it's everton 2 liverpool 2 lukaku with a great equaliser . pray and hope it finishes this way , that will be great results
great great game . i just lost me shit for that everton goal .
the merseyside derby is heating up just like we like it !!! 
if only liverpool had the second most inform striker in the prem on the bench .. oh wait üòè
everton are the better team by far . fucking shite defense and havent made a decent play in like 45 mins ...
really want everton to win this now
i'm angry at phil dowd , i'm angry everton still has 11 men , i'm angry at roy hodgson , i'm angry at joe allen ... i could go on . 
3 - romelu lukaku has scored in his last three premier league appearances against liverpool .

wheres the best to stay in for one night for four people ?
 to win this game .. fingers crossed .

mirallas was the only reason everton were able to score that goal , fantastic play to steal it away from mignolet . 
neighbour obviously an everton fan ( who would have thought) . the noise he's making ! smh
this liverpool - everton match is great football !
cmon liverpool
lock ih dung everton !
everton
2-2 good stuff everton for the win
oh shut up everton
get in everton !
that lukaku goal shows how jose sent him to take points off potential rivals . liverpool could leave with 1 instead of 3 because of it .
mignolet can do all he wants but when you leave the most dangerous player unmarked what the fuck do you expect liverpool
current everton chant : hence the small time mentality .
yessssss lukaku !!! i'm an honorary everton fan for the day , genuinely celebrated as if spurs had scored
have a word with yourselves ffs . everton should have ten . we may as well have . get danny on and who knows ...
keep singing everton fans !
set for a thrilling last 20 minutes of the merseyside derby . * 2-2 
so many happy liverpudlians at goodison park , which will only last til they wake up tomorrow realizing they're still in liverpool ...
i would just love everton to go and win ( mirallas winner optional ) just for rodger's interview . he would go just mental about that tackle .
everton did everyton to get this equalizer .
not even an everton supporter but i'm glad they've equalised , they deserved it !
come on everton ! martinez can do anything
liverpool will win
the ref has been so biased to everton it's unreal !! üò°üò≠
please liverpool

go , everton , go ! lukaku , you awesome person , you .

i need liverpool to score now and park the damn bus . can you do this for me
comon everton
just got a glancing view of the meyerside derby ... hormones now up courtesy of lukaku's equaliser for everton !
mignolet hasn't deserved to concede today , but everton have been flying this second half .
i wonder who is more upset at the moment : jose mourinho for letting lukaku go out on loan to everton or joe allen for missing a sitter ?
allen : everton's fans favourite player . 
in the 2nd half , mignolet has been liverpool's best player . when your goalkeeper is the best player you know there's something wrong .
everton coaches to foul hard and go down at contact . worked well toay
i am so pissed off with joe allen right now . to miss that sitter . if that had of gone in everton would of been well out of it . 
marouane fellaini has told everton that he wants to join manchester united , [ mail ] today via 
all of a sudden everton are dominating
everton are starting to piss me off now ... wankers

liverpool 2-2 everton
goal everton 2-2 liverpool ( 72 mins ) romelu lukaku brings everton level with a precise finish from inside the area 
argh lukaku scores , had a feeling the joe allen miss would come back to haunt liverpool . kmt
hunting in ' 13 . sitting in stand , i just watched suarez score a ridiculous free kick goal for liverpool in a soccer match across the globe
so basically joe allen is a bag of shit and everton get a goal via an assist from a player that shouldn't even be on the pitch ? typical
hope joe allen has a post match interview and apologises to every liverpool fan around the whole country .
 : everton 2-2 liverpool . catch 22 ! last mersyside derby ended with this scoreline .
rossss barkeyyyyyy ! everton 2-2 liverpool
only once in 91 games have everton come from behind to beat liverpool .
it's been all everton dis 2nd half
haha liverpool fans ain't so loud now aha fucking gobshites
i did say 3-2 everton
martinez is actually doing a good job with everton .
everton everton everton 
martinez's everton > moyes's everton
latest goal !!! lukaku finally gets some joy against mignolet everton are back on level terms everton 2-2 liverpool
everton fans singing gives you goosebumps !

everton the greatest team the world has ever seen ? the delusion of this crowd
liverpool fans feeling sick !! what liverpool fans ?!

everton deserved that equaliser , if it wasn't for mignolet , liverpool would be losing right now
if liverpool do not win the derby , the blame is on joe allen .
how can liverpool fans be blaming joe allen if we lose or draw ? yes it was a shocking miss but defense has been fucking awful
in the name of fuck any chance here liverpool silly fucking free kicks is costing us
damn , woke up late and now missing the merseyside derby 
another everton goal please ;-)
if he'd just put away that sitter it would of been a sure thing but no once again liverpool play some daft cunt who everyone knows is shite
liverpool will win .
allen should never kick a ball in a liverpool jersey again .. shit player 
if this is liverpool's so called year , they need to win today . you have a champions mentality when you win derby games .
lukaku has now scored in his last three premier league appearances against liverpool . consistent .

everton to take the full 3 points ?
liverpool has a keeper at goalie though .

common everton u guys re almost there
come on everton !!!! fuck off you dirty moaning liverpool scumbags
liverpool will nick this
everton fans are quality
fingers crossed for liverpool to get another goal in the last awaiting minutes 
mourinho loaned lukaku to everton just so he could troll our pl title rivals .
good game this . the merseyside derby is never a game to miss , unless united are playing . i see a late everton goal for some reason .
ahhh everton deserved that ! joe allen's miss is going to haunt us fuck sake
everton should be a man down & allen should have scored . what a miss that was . 
pls lose liverpool :d
if liverpool give the ball away 1 more time this half üò° ! mirralas is also a dirty horrible rat ! and suarez is a queer !!! 
so i told dad about everton scored a goal and he said " padan muka , you better sleep la " . which side are you dad ? - . -
everton make me proud
thok 1 goal more 
i'm watching the liverpool's game live , via timelime .
in the 2nd half , mignolet has been liverpool's best player . when your goalkeeper is the best player you know there's something wrong ."
mirallas is too good for everton ... he is not world-class but could play at a higher level ...
everton are throwing themselves about like a bunch of pussies , man up
everton one more goal and that's all .
 everton vs liverpool
,... come on everton ,... give me something ,..

romelu lukaku has scored in his last three premier league appearances against liverpool .
* cue liverpool fans having a meltdown about how bad the refereeing decisions have been in this game *
come on everton !!
i actually need everton to win this match for the sake of arsenal's lead
apparently when lucas first moved to liverpool they had to teach him how to use the squirty water bottles
wtf dowd basically an everton player 
everton really want to win .
i truly do not understand henderson's game . need to watch liverpool games more often
sturridge is coming on , hopefully to get a winner for liverpool .

the joe allen miss is going to haunt liverpool . 
i can see everton getting the win here , clearly playing the better football
home for the last 20 of the match , and its 2-2 , should be some finnish 
everton have played brilliantly so far in the second half .
the commentator spoke about everton's famously loud fans . was pretty quiet until they scored there - and it's a derby ! this is football now .
lukaku is really poor with his decision making , everton shud av score 2goals .
everton comeback ? holy jesus

everton have been asking all sorts of the questions this second-half and finally they've been rewarded üëè

liverpool draw would be a good result for arsenal
go everton ! go everton !
joe allen has single handily cost liverpool this match if they don't win . taxi for allen ! 
liverpool will complain about the non-red but you still have to play even when that happens . everton bossing midfield . where'd we see that ?
jose's plan is working . sent lukaku to everton to take points off the title challengers
an everton winner would be ace , but i'll take this result all the same .
everton have the momentum here .

eighton baines has been substituted off in a premier league game for the first time since september 2008 ( everton v hull )
for 20 years or more , liverpool have been playing with 1 striker . and what do they have to show for it ? no premier league title .. shame
liverpool had better lose this game ! the drawing scoreline's favourable though ! :)
as long as lukaku is the only everton player that scores i'll be happy
80 ' everton 2 - 2 liverpool
hope everton hold liv to a draw

i guess i want everton to win as roberto martinez doesn't look like an extra from mi6 in skyfall .

:( 3-2 everton . 4 goals out of 5 are from my fantasy team though so i guess silver linings .
lukaku shows why he's too good for the chavscums and puts the blue side of liverpool in the lead 3-2 to everton
lukaku is a beast ! defenders overpowered on that headed goal . mourinho was mental to let him go . now up 3-2 . 
hold on everton
why oh why did we let lukaku go to everton
oh , now you're just showing off , lukaku . everton are looking down upon moyes/fellaini in the table and that's just too good .
ok this merseyside derby is more than just a warm up to arsenal vs southampton this has been so good . 
what manager wouldn't want lukaku at their disposal ? mourinho has fucked up big time letting him go to everton . a beast of a player .
loooooool liverpool thought they had this
too many mignolet saves . handed everton this win on a platter .
love seeing liverpool get beat fucking hate them
hold on everton
yes everton . lets get the 3 points here . come on
liverpool are nothing but shite . just absolute shite . done nothing but miss sitters and play shite football . just shite altogether 
go'ead fook off liverpool

wow liverpool üòî
liverpool are so so so shit in the second half 
liverpool have a great goalkeeper in mignolet but this everton attacking force can only be kept at bay so much .

as chelsea supposedly eye another big money striker move in january , it seems bizarre that their best striker plays for everton ...
lukaku u beast !!! everton deserved lead . 
everton just turned it on liverpool holy
everton yes
mignolet has been outstanding for but has conceded 3 goals - sorely lacking in other parts of the pitch 
cracking merseyside derby .
lukaku . enough said .

everton have to understand it not over yet calm done and keep possession
ohhhhhh and lukaku puts everton in front from for the 1st time !!!
this is why i love liverpool ' brother :p

" lukaku ! fantastic scoring goal against liverpool " - commentator . well , that was an awesome goal , i admit . but still ... ah </3
he loves playing against liverpool , destroyed them when he played for west brom last season too .
lukakuuuuuuuu again liverpool are just an average team with one special forward !
gonna be class watching liverpool slip down the league to the pony position they belong at
is it possible to make a season long loan player ur legend ? if so everton can make lukaku theirs
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah running around my house !! lakaku is a beast !! come on everton !!!
liverpool desperate already .
everton 3 - 2 liverpool , arsenal - southampton , fulham - swansea city hull city - crystal palace 
you'll never walk alone lah liverpool

fuck sake üôà everton u cunts
stat : all 5 goals have come from a set piece in the merseyside derby this afternoon . 
everton !!!!!!! yeah !
being a liverpool fan is so fuckin annoying . fuck you joe allen i blame you
liverpool haven't created much from open play . relying on suarez really won't get you far . everton deserve to be ahead .
liverpool fans be like we got sas . lmao more like ass .
doesn't look like liverpool's gonna win the wanted
lukaku has now made it 4 out of 4 against liverpool .... still see liverpool gettn a late goal
g'wan everton
and just think .... everton couldn't score past us !! ;)
yes everton
c'mon liverpool !!!!!
liverpool are so fucking shit
liverpool piss me off

wow , lukaku on fire ! goodluck to liverpool
i think maybe 4-3 everton lol
arsenal fans cheering for everton thinking that the title race is between them and liverpool . 
e gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg lukaku de novo - everton 3x2 liverpool
lol liverpool
epic derby yes derby
typical liverpool ....
joe allen you can fuck off out of liverpool as well you useless prick
well i won be winning 100k üòÇ liverpool are such bottle jobs !
if you're watching the merseyside derby instead of the england nz game you're a tool
lukaku transformed west brom last year . he's done same at everton this year .
liverpool fans feel 3-2 to turn over to the rugby
typical liverpool should be 3-1 up and now 3-2 down
everton game and the england new zealand games have been epic so far 
everton games are the best just because of lukaku . can't wait to see him in chelsea blue .
liverpool are just dead food .
said it would be a good game if turned up 3-2 ! nice one everton . not disappointed this 
the amount of stress being a liverpool fan is too fucking much
everton have gotta love us 
liverpool why ?
game would have been over if joe allen wasn't a retard . fucking dope . never ever good enough to wear a liverpool shirt .
shame liverpool
mup everton
everton have battered us in this second half . once again , no control of midfield , carved open so easily . league position a deception .
lukaku agaaaaain ! only just listen the roar of goodison park stadium !!! liverpool looses !! what a fantastic match !!! eve 3-2 liv
can't handle everton fans right now , especially when half of them are girls
liverpool don't deserve this
i hope liverpool fans weren't lukakuing ( looking ) to be first place after this weekend :/
chelsea why did you loan out lukaku to everton why
a comeback from everton . hehe
don't think there's a more hated team on my timeline than liverpool hahahahah .
that was deserved . liverpool have been fucking shit today . schoolboy mistakes could be 6 only for mignolet
* o * watch a # ! @%ing goal !!! 
yes everton !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
moyes ' work at everton is still paying dividends . 
liverpool fans üòÇüòÇüòÇ
yes lukaku , cant fucking stand liverpool 
sterling performance 4rm liverpool !!
so . a 4-2-4 with a gerrard who can't go 90 and was key in everton's first two . everton swarm . corner . johnson on lukaku . drinks all ' round .
what a great comeback by everton 
have to say though , everton have really upped their game this season . probably to do with the fact they have a better manager .
yes everton ! thanks for that ( y )
i fuckin knew this ! the international breaks come to fuck liverpool ! always
merseyside derby is better than manchester derby
now that we're getting beat , i guess i should be bitter and point out the fact that everton should be down to ten men
it should be 5-2 ... but that liverpool's goal keeper's toooo stubborn !!!
romelu lukaku fires everton into the lead . what a game this is . everton 3-2 liverpool . 
now defend your led everton , less than 1o minute to go
can you tell i'm chuffed with that everton goal ?
ha ha ha 
lucky everton we dont have our first 11 .
lukaku and everton just ruined liverpool's party . 3-2
piss off , i mean seriously liverpool .
bloody hell need to sort this defending out 
heweo liverpool !
fuck bt sport !!!! why am i not watching this liverpool vs everton game üò°üò°üò° sounds like a worldie !!
yeah had liverpool on my treble !! 
everton has been playing better . their midfielders dominate the game
this is unacceptable liverpool
this is a result of everton being brave and getting forward in numbers . fair play to them .
yass everton fuck jed
typical liverpool .....
everton deserve this . liverpool have been awful defending this half . mignolet has kept them in it before now .
no excuses for liverpool there . lukaku with two in 11 minutes . he's the one guy you have to watch , and they don't . basically asleep . 
now , the comfortable liverpool has just become the frustrated liverpool . lolz .
no liverpool !!!! can never keep a lead ! üëéüò°
yes , ! my day is looking up . 
while it might be a canny move loaning lukaku to everton to do damage against the other top teams , i still think chelsea are barking mad
everton leading liverpool . what a cracker‚Ä¶
piss off everton
everton vs liverpool ... such a great game !
but this everton vs liverpool game .... ehh , true ‚öΩ at its best ! ‚ò∫ ‚úå blood-draining !
poor defending once again . detrimental from liverpool .
lukaka . everton doin it for me . this epl . its stil goin to be excitin . wht a season we have .
no matter what happens , we are still the best on merseyside , 
man crush on lukaku continues . pencilling in everton home game to pay my respects .
it seems like utd fans care more about liverpool match then they do ehen utd are playing
omo liverpool get haters oh .... see people wey want dem to drop points .... hahahaha !
lukaku makes it 3-2 .. first brace in his first derby merseyside .. you mad , mou ?
come on everton ! lets get the job done !
so sorry liverpool
boy liverpool match hot ... hope a so manning cup finals stay lata
if everton hold on to this omggg come on !
joe allen is going to be popular in that dressing room . misses an absolute sitter to make it 3-1 and now everton go 3-2 up 
just a thought but - remember everyone being upset about lloris getting clattered at everton ? same thing with lukaku at upton park , no ?
the pigs(liverpool ) must die
my brother nearly put money on a 3-3 draw at the merseyside derby ..... at 67/1 .... if liverpool score now ...
the butlins everton section just went potty ... üéµüéµüçªüçªüéµüéµüçªüçª

bye liverpool , great work everton ! if liverpool only played 2nd halfs , they would rank 14 !!
there . nuff said . credits to everton for never giving up . liverpool didnt control the game when they should and we paid for it . nights 
this is exactly why we sent him to a team like everton ... take points away from big teams so we can win epl 
this is too much pressure now . i cant stand it . please everton please . 
my brothers just in his room raging because of everton üòÇüòÇüòÇ
and liverpool defense melts like a walls ice cream on a hot summer day 
damn lukaku puts everton up 3-2 against liverpool with under 10 mins to go . why the guy is not in a chelsea kit is beyond me . hurm
lfc has such a shit defense , for fuck sake . every time everton attack , shit cunts . forget strikers rodgers buy some decent defenders
everton 3 - 2 liverpool . premier league is back
lukaku is awesome . i dont know why or how mourinho let him go on loan . 2 goals to go up 3-2 on liverpool , good work brother .
adu liverpool . ..: -)
 powerful header ! everton surely have won it now 
i love merseyside derbies
that was such shocking defending by liverpool , not taking away anything from √©verton though , great goal !
cracker of a merseyside derby !!!
despite lukaku getting everton in front , he has been terrible today
everton attacking a lot if course it was gonna happen 3 - 2
merseyside derbies been the shit tho ...!
yess everton 3

arsenal fans are happy liverpool are loosing because they don't go on top of the pl table
liverpool are losing , took lukaku out of my team and i'm injure great day so far ..
what score was liverpool vs everton ?!?!!
if liverpool did 2nd halves they'd be unstoppable .
 
everton 3-2 liverpool
fantastic game by everton !
i love watching everton and asking myself which players will be with larger clubs next year
fuck a !!!!
freekick .. liverpool has a chance !
wow everton what a comeback they deserve to win this !!!!
god will u punish u liverpool fc .

chelsea best striker plays for everton ain't that some shit
everton go defensive ! hoping to runaway with this 3-2

everton deserved that . we've been woeful second half .
terluka hati fans liverpool
how the fuck can everton not score in three games and score 3 in one game ! fuck off !!
liverpool goal coming
assist kevin mirallas provided the corner from which romelu lukaku powered home everton's third goal 
holy shit lukaku what a leap ! everton leading the match with 8 minutes left !
liverpool go still score , all na draw
everton have been better but how they have 11 on pitch fucking disgrace ...
come on merseyside blue !!
lol lah liverpool miss so many goals
i honestly don't think everton would swap lukaku for ba/eto'o/torres combined , unbelievable young striker 
allen's miss looks a bit costly now doesn't it . had he squared that/hot the target everton wouldn't lead 3-2 . they'd be 1-3 down .
for fuck sake liverpool
liverpool lol
unbelievable . fair play to everton today , totally jumped on our weaknesses of set pieces and lack of midfield .
what ! wow ! im not a fan of neither team but lukaku just scored another goal to put everton up over liverpool 3-2 . 
come on liverpool !
one more for everton go on
what a match . everton deservedly ahead . mignolet the only lfc player to show up . efc should be up by 3 or 4
great game of football this , want everton to probably win this , hate liverpool scum
thank you lukaku , thank you everton .... uas truely manu fan .
if everton can hold on and the roughriders win tomorrow . perfect weekend .
wow wow wow , the game just turn in favour of arsenal in the mersey side . lukaku scores his second to put everton up for the first time
chelsea scored a brace for everton to make it 3-2 . everton 3 - 2 liverpool
lukaku <3 . liverpool got a taste of their wn medicine . torn apart on counter attack by everton .!!! merseyside derbies awesome .
good one everton . liv is finished now .
all everton fans outside are goin nutss hahaha
somehow i think lukaku has become something of a legend to everton fans right now !
 : belford , richards-everton , richards , courtney ( c) , peniket , capaldi , todd , chadwick , hildreth , morgan and keane .
my mum predicted 4-3 to liverpool .. maybe ? wishful thinking ?
pointer sister 3 liverpool 2
everton of now is fair better than before
liverpool not winning this is 95% joe allen's fault in my opinion . 3-1 would've been game over . 
come on !!! everton !! great comeback !
gotta love these merseyside derbies .
don't care that i had a draw in this accy . hate liverpool
romelu lukaku very strong in the air he has really made his mark in this merseyside derby
fuck everton .

the merseyside derby is killing my fantasy team , 3 liverpool players and they're losing , and only everton guy i had in got subbed off injured
wtf !! lukaku again ? everton 3 - 2 liverpool !
lukaku scored 2 goals for everton i mean why the fuck did we loan him ...??!!!
yesssssssss ! gotta hold out now ! 6 minutes to go ! 
did liverpool really think that they'll remain on top ?? that goes for arsenal and southampton too 
i might just do one for all liverpool fans and stab up henderson
hahaha ! liverpool will always walk alone !
i wanted a draw but am still happy everton are winning
everton ! what a derby this has been , glad i woke up early .
i thought the massive cheer as i walked down the steps to the stadium was a sign of my fame finally being realised . actually an everton goal
lukaku is a beast , liverpool should be thinking there goalkeeper , this could have been worse
liverpool bamutta . i expected that but chose to leave the match
yes ! get in ! come on you blues ! everton 3-2 liverpool !!!
hahaha , see i told you everton 3-2 liverpool
come on everton .....
to all those team that haven't played everton , i sorry for una

liverpool fc do yawa .... dem get mof too roff ..
what a game 3-2 come on everton !!!!
the corner kick .. the head .. lukaku scores for the advantage 3-2 
everton deserves it thou . they'v wasted too many chances
liverpool is droping all three points :) time to grab this chance with both hands for arsenal ! 
outstanding performance , great job everton 
my feed is basically alan sugar and john green tweeting about the merseyside derby
ohhhhhh yesssssss lucky lukaku does it again 3-2 everton com on ye blues we love u coyb-nsno-imwt-iewb-etid-batb-ftrs
please lukaku stay at everton or come to arsenal you'll waste your career at chelsea
classic ' oh shit a ball quick guys run away so it doesn't hit us ' defending from liverpool there
joe allen could of sealed it , 3-2 everton 
mignolet has really been class . the only reason liverpool have had a chance all day .
cba with out adam dancing round cos everton are winning ahha sit down right now üò†
oh well as long as liverpool are losing !!
ahh come on liverpool let's go
great game in the merseyside derby 
love see drawn
what a turn of events at godison park . lukaku has just scored a stunning goal . liverpool needs to pull one back . it's 3-2 everton .
arsenal &liverpool dead dead dead !!!
can liverpool come back
detest disillusioned liverpool fans
was gonna put a tenner on everton 3-2 as well . then again if i'd have done it , we'd be winning .
hope everton keep this up
everton has turned d match around
walk into the kitchen at work to see the chef dancing because fucking everton scored , god damn it
after wasting a great chance deulefeu win a corner , lukaku towers above flanagan . goal 3-2 everton .
can't help but laugh at liverpool
romelu lukaku has scored more goals against liverpool than any other premier league side with 4
now what liverpool ?????
liverpool would be wondering where it went wrong
why is flanagan marking everton's biggest threat on a set piece ? 
lol .. liverpool , how market ?
another goal from lukaku !!! everton up 3-2 !!!
cheers joe allan for missing that fckin sitter ya fuckin knob ridin high heel wearing bastard ye 
why are we watching everton vs liverpool when we support manchester united
what a cracking merseyside derby 
the merseyside derby is most definitely living up to expectation !
what a game the merseyside derby is , come on everton !
mignolet is outstanding , but liverpool's defense is very poor , especially against balls in the air . 3-2 . 
come on everton !
go everton go !
would be difficult to begrudge everton the win . mingolet doesn't deserve to be on any losing team , though .
not necessarily on that goal but reds defense is getting shredded . this game could easily , probably should be , 5-4 everton
come on ! you deserve this ! 
everton or liverpool !
well deserved everton !!
i think mourinho has regret loan lukaku to everton
lukaku rules . coyb ! pride of merseyside !
a liverpool draw , an arsenal draw or loss , a chelsea loss or draw then a united win will automatically make this weekend lovely . 
ohhh man ..... thats bad defending by johnson he let lukaku run ahead from him ... goal conceded by us .... 3-2 to everton ~bharat~
those everton fans wouldn't be celebrating any more if they'd won the lottery . what a game ! 
good work 
this is joe allen's fault . we had the game in the bag then allen went and missed the chance and gave everton hope and belief
if i don't see an everton player being stretchered off i'm gonna be pissed .
this everton versus liverpool is definitely a front runner for best premier league match of the year . 3-2 blues now .
laughing at liverpool right now
he's blown it for liverpool today . changes required , but wrong ones made .
hopefully liverpool drop points and arsenal can capitalise
every bit as much as we expect from a merseyside derby . tim howard's beard has magic .
yes everton
ohh noo ! everton leading .. go ! go ! liverpool ynwa
where to go in any one got any ideas
liverpool losing . that means that arsenal have a chance to stay at the top of the table .
thank you everton . thank you lukaku . god bless your souls !! lol :)
if anyone thinks we will equalise now i admire your belief ! but everton want this more and that shows
yesss everton
everton everton everton !! go cold every time ! get in you blue boysss !!!
he keeps proving jose wrong ... lukakau got his second of the afternoon . 3 liverpool 2 .
lukakkuuuuuuuuu 3-2 ohmaygoosh i love youu ! everton , you rockss ! you're hootttt !! rambut gimbalmu mengalihkan duniaku
the merseyside derby is everything you want in a derby ! really entertaining game for the neutrals too ! always prefer the games at goodison !
shaking like a leaf , come on everton !!!
this deulofeu kid for everton is sick . they must be pissed he's just on loan from barcelona ..
impressive performance from today ... great game for the neutral ! 3-2 ahead now .
how good is this game ! won't lie i hope liverpool score
another set piece . lukaku is the one player on everton you can't let get a free header . for the umpteenth time , how did chelsea loan him ??
who is this lukaku guy ? he new ? when did everton buy him ?
liverpool lousy ley . cannot maintain
fucking liverpool again can't finish teams off !!!! need a goal asap !!! 
omg lukaku , you awesome beast !!! everton came back from 1-2 to 3-2 , hope they win this , they deserve this win . 
will liverpool ever win the epl ? 
come on liverpool
everton liverpool lourd le derby
liverpool can still pull it back though . they have enough fire power in their arsenal .
3-2 everton ; cracking header by lukaku but some slack marking by johnson left him free there 
this why we probably won't finish top 4 . not beating small clubs is unforgivable 
lukaku is a beast . a very well deserved win for everton , the better team is winning .
tuseme this liverpool vs everton match is awesome !!! lukaku ... roooaaar !
everton must be winning because tony is really happy
an amazing merseyside derby . but still 10 minutes to go .
everton should also have 10 men .
lukaaakuuu my congo donny ! get in there everton !
brilliant header from lukaku ... everton takes the lead
liverpool getting a beat down aye !
everton 2 : 2 liverpool ( 84 ' ) if any one is missing this because of election :) 
everton comeback
merseyside derby proving well worth the outlay for bt sport ... perfect hangover cure & post-poker win celebrations ! 
liverpool is making me cry already !.....
just like didier had an affinity to score against arsenal , seems lukaku has developed one for liverpool .
joe allen's liverpool career is over .
and we love you , everton !!!!!!!!
dirty everton bastards shouldn't even have 11 players .
can not believe that anyone views liverpool as genuine title contenders . they are truly inept at the back
yes !!! well done everton . xx !!!!
liverpool don't deserve anything from this game we've played fucking awful !
great game . are wonderful to watch
liverpool
fck everton
merseyside derby off the hook . wow ! worth every bit of lost sleep this morning . can sturridge help pull lpool level ?
jesus christ . mignolet didn't saw that coming . congrats to lukaku to take everton into the lead against liverpool . solid header 
if only joe allen would hv scored 
this everton game is unbelievable !! 
my mate just said " that's y we loaned him to " 
i can see the sense in bringing on stones like , helps everton plug those little gaps suarez seems to find .
lukaku going rampant versus liverpool ; how come it was everton and not to go after him in the summer ? i know : he costs money to buy !
although i wanted a draw , i'll still be satisfied seeing liverpool lose !
fuck off liverpool .
this is easily the best match of the season so far . you don't have to be an everton/liverpool fan to say that . bloody brilliant .
god help everton
on scale of phil dowd to howard webb how much do you hate liverpool oh no difference y'all hate liverpool anyways
wow everton , really ? lol
notice how liverpool have been vulnerable in transitions since lucas went off .
what a comeback by everton in the merseyside derby .
it would be a completely different match if everton went down to 10 men like the should !!
love how the whole nation comes together , as one , when liverpool lose .
gollll everton
the joy of liverpool losing 
lukakuuuuuu , what an animal !! if everton win this be some win !
please hold in to this lead everton !!! üôè
liverpool till i die
last bet for liverpool if it finishes a draw 5k gets 10k
le derby everton - liverpool >>>>>
lukaku has single handedly crushed liverpool !!! 
come on everton 5 more mins
typical liverpool
everton have some kind good youngsters
what a merseyside derby this is !!
make that 5 in 4 for lukaku against liverpool ! maybe it 4 in 3 but i'm sure he scored for against in league cup last season ?
everton are an average team with a ace manager . fair play to martinez unbeaten at home this year .
everton are looking solid this year , bit of a slow start but on form now .
the reason why liverpool ended up like this is allen's miss and gerrard , he's been out of this game since the 1st minute .
liverpool have never been able to cope with lukaku ! 
hunger games sucked . maybe you will like it a little if you don't go in thinking it will be good and dammit liverpool wtf
3 - romelu lukaku has scored in his last three premier league appearances against liverpool . target ."
nd so everton is changing it for liverpool
everton takes 3-2 lead over . stadium goes ballistic !

such a same that cpfc didn't get credit for holding everton . lazy journalism and simple narrative about eagles this season 
love watching liverpool get beat .
lukaku scored 2 goals against liverpool , have now 7 goals in the league . amazing talant . 
keep calm and merseyside .
lukaku scores the 2nd , brilliant play from everton here 
to be fair that was coming everton all over liverpool . say joe allen is gonna get some bollocking for earlier ha
he loves scoring against liverpool .. at west brom too .. 2 goals against liverpool
everton vs . liverpool is always a great fixture 
fucking happy when everton scored !
he's on fire , that belgian , romelu menama lukaku . everton 3-2 liverpool . with 5 minutes left it wouldn't surprise me to see another goal .
with 10 to go everton 3 , liverpool 2 . great match !
goal ! everton is leading by lukaku header ! 82m - everton 3-2 liverpool 
been a cracking merseyside derby .
so how many goals has lukaku score liverpool ? 5 ?

victor moses can in when it was 1-2 , now its 3-2 to everton .... am just saying tho
 vs great game !
the best derby ever !
oh dear , there goes my prediction of 2-2 out of the window . everton score through lukaku to make it 3-2 to everton . 5min to play .
siala . 6min left and everton takes the lead . this game intense sia
great fightback from everton . joe allen should go to his room and think about what he has done 
goal everton 3-2 liverpool ( 82 mins) . romelu lukaku powers a header past simon mignolet from a corner 
so da prediction turn ... i predicted a 3-2 liverpool win
october 2010 last time liverpool lost to everton .. 
liverpool must always piss me off haaa t actual fuck !
what a turn around for everton fc . its 3-2 with seven minutes remaining ...
everton , newcastle and southampton are such likeable teams
keep it up for the last five everton that is what i am talking about , can you hear the red shite sing nooo nooo 
lukaku is better than torres nd eto put together .. miles b√™tr .. some1 should tell jose he loaned his best player to everton 
feel for liverpool thoüòÇüòÇüòÇ but when congo's on the scene ... üî• 
everton turned it around and the highest we can get is a draw nw ..
come on everton . fuck the bin dippers over
liverpool , what is this shit
but who knows ? maybe liverpool might shoot back
goaaaaaaaaal everton ... fuck liverpoooool
everton refused to give up like himba girls refusing to wear bras !
well done liverpool , thrown it away again ...
well , liverpool could have finished the game off if that goat had passed that ball to suarez . everton lead 3-2 . 
let's all laugh at liverpool .. hahahaha !
all i can hear is jamie screaming every goal scored for everton üòÇüòÇ brilliant
allen has lost this for us . 3-1 up everton weren't coming back

haha go on everton
everton
liverpool under the pump . fucking 3-2 .
liverpool one goal only . pleaasseee
liverpool doing an amazing impersonation of a team playing down a man .
lukaku , if only you scored that penalty in preseason you would've been at chelsea & not on loan . it's a pleasure everton .
in work an everton fan running round like a idiot and a liverpool fan whos not talking to any1 haha love footy me
great comeback by everton
40m + torres for falcao ? why don't you just pay everton to call lukaku back ?
everton is playing so well . 
lukaku 17 or lukaku 18 , what else matters ? turning to be liverpool nemsis 
everton have played well though
terrible liverpool performance . worst ive seen gerrard play 
hahahahaha . this is absolute shite by liverpool , again . unbelievable ! 
49ers and liverpool both losing to muchüò•
i'd like a draw but i don't mind everton winning
come on everton !
if joe allen put that chance away when liverpool were 2-1 up it would be a much different game !
oh my c'mon everton
game of set pieces this ! lukaku is so frustrating at times in open play . need to do more than just score to play for chelsea lad . everton üëç
oh liverpool . lukak-your defending . it's been horrendous . 92 
lukaku gets his second of the night . everton came from behind to lead 3-2 now at goodison park 
call yourself title challengers ? you can't even beat your neighbours . everton are bigger than liverpool
da merseyside derby rarely disappoints . gr8 game by all standards .
come on liverpool , get the equalizer
everton 3-2 liverpool . 6 mins plus injury time . can liverpool score to equalise ? or is it ?
fuck it now liverpool are behind
liverpool have really messed up 
i'm so happy liverpool are losing
this everton v liverpool game is why i wake up early the watch the english premier league 
there it is 3-2 everton's advantage . way too many second chance balls given by liverpool .
can't believe i'm missing the merseyside derby . sounds like an absolute cracker .
liverpool defending of all the 3 goals is questionable . their defence has been lethargic in this game .
my house just erupted when everton took the lead
looks like umma win my 200 dollars !!! üëèüëèüôåüôåüí∏üí∏ thank you everton !!!
would much appreciate liverpool if you could score a couple goals as arsenal are about to run away with the league
5 minutes + extra time .. u can do it 
woah liverpool is losing ?!
yes everton proooo
there's some right sport on in the pub today , merseyside derby has been quality and the rugby league
liverpool get off me
what a cracking merseyside derby 3-2 everton
liverpool are shit
everton now lead 
if liverpool could defend they would be a half decent team
everton rocked the day ! liverpool is losing ! yayyy
great title challenge from liverpool
come on everton 
come on everton pls do this we'll give you fellaini back
merseyside derby is class .
liverpool though .. phuck
where is all the football quote saying how good liverpool is ?!
lukaku is a beast ! we're all doomed everton is top notch ... fucking shahin !
yess . still top of the table . thank you everton .
everton 3-2 liverpool
didn't expect everton to be winning this one
eish . this match is bp inducing . come on liverpool !
awesome . i'd just stuck a fiver on everton to nick it , at 7/1 . hold on everton !
well played everton !
tf liverpool !!!!
 what a game ! liverpool had the game but now its 3-2 for everton !
merseyside derby has got to be the best saturday lunchtime kick off i have seen in a long long time
thanks everton
he had no problem loaning him out with the belief that he will help everton take points off the other top teams . today is proof that works .
everton have gone up a few levels since martinez took over from moyes 
switching between the merseyside derby and the rugby league semi final , both great games !!
do everton go top ? got to say that martinez has done a brilliant job so far .
we ain't doing shit . i feel these men don't know nothing about the merseyside derby cause this ain't fucking it /:
liverpool needs to pick it the fuck up !
everton comeback huaaaaa yeaaahhh
glad i got up to watch liverpool - everton . what a game ! 
lukaku puts everton 3-2 up in the merseyside derby . everton have a chance of going 3rd in the league with a win
great header !! lukaku , next drogba !! 3-2 for everton , amazing comeback !
romelu lukaku is such a machine ! come on everton !
liverpool playing ordinary today , hate to say everton deservedly leaders but i haven't given up on the reds
yes lukaku ! my betting jinx has been lifted ! had a feeling liverpool wouldn't leave goodison with anything more than a point
lukaku won't score those goals against a good defence , liverpool defending has been awful .
liverpool you can't lead the game , set up the set , and then start losing :/
sooooo peak for liverpool
this liverpool vs everton match is shaping up to be the best match of the year so far
what a game ! everton haven't come from behind to beat liverpool since the first world war , is it gonna happen ? lukaku take a bow üëå
barkley , deulofeu and lukaku just orchestrating the entire everton attack . what a game . what a game .
can't wait till lukaku leaves at the end of the season , everton will probs get relegated
liverpool are the shittest team in the league
after this performance by mignolet you'd think liverpool are up
how is everton beating liverpool 
dat everton's no 10 is useless
but for now i'm happy liverpool are so crap
goal everton 3-2 liverpool ( 82 mins) . romelu lukaku powers a header past simon mignolet from a corner 
liverpool pancut awal ?
really hope everton win ! 
everton everton everton everton everton . but i do respect suarez . cause he's the top scorer eventhough he mises 5 matches . everton !
how and why is mirallas still on the pitch ? and liverpool are sloppy , starting to look typical
all liverpool players do is five lol 
liverpool kena por . _ .
liverpool diersea
it has been confirmed , liverpool is blue !
everton dominate me on fifa 14 anyways
ha liverpool are shit !
everton liverpool , what a game
liverpool back on form .

i love the merseyside derby !!!
everton these points are yours
drinking coffee next to the christmas tree and watching donovan have a meltdown over the liverpool game 
poor from liverpool ! that allen miss is looking very very costly
lukaku is proper nutty 3-2 everton what a game
everton need to defend more or simply score another goal .
what a game ..... lukaku puts everton on the brink of an important win . living to its expectations .
how the father fuck did we fucking lose the fucking lead to fucking everton fuck me fuck you fuck l u k a k u
dragged out shopping and now everton are winning ... typical
so by the look of my tl i can see liverpool is doing any-fxcking-thingüòí
this game is just phenomenal , 100 miles/hour . awesome lukaku ! everton should have been out of site . hope the win 
there's so much space at the back everton can win this 4-2 if they get this right ...
no i think lukaku saw my tweet your welc liverpool :)
yes liverpool drop points :)
and lukaku saves the day at the liverpool derby . 
liverpool are good in attack but completely shit in defense .
everton would deserve be winning but mirrallas shouldn't be on the pitch !
who's going to finish higher this season . everton or liverpool ?
life is hard when you support liverpool
everton vs liverpool ...... game of the season so far !
yes everton !!!
though an everton win won‚Äôt let us leapfrog them in the table , it means with 3 points we could be 1 point behind liverpool .
fucked off , liverpool are fucking soooo shit
yes good one everton !! 
everton doin liverpool strong tin .
everton is awesome .... goodison park is a fortress anyday anytime
don't think i actually know anyone who is an everton fan
miralles makes two assists to probably win the game for everton when he shouldn't be on the pitch ... 
epic stuff from . brilliant comeback 
liverpool getting me vexed

come on everton hold on
fuck you liverpool scum
belgium vs liverpool right now .
to be fair we have capitulated in the second half and everton were running straight through the middle . if allen had scored ...
i can imagine liverpool's midfield being invisible . can't rely on suarez for everything .
who knew that joe allen was keeping it all together for liverpool .
that has been coming everton better without moyes utd are worse with him 
joe allen wont play for liverpool again
i've shrieked & zita's brought me a toy to make me better ;)

shock-and-awe as lukaku powers everton ahead . piercing noise from goodison stands .
that was a great finish by lukaku powerful header . 
retweet if you're laughing at liverpool
everton are just spoilers
that deuloufeu is a pain in the ass for liverpool
fair play , joe allen didn't take his chance to win it for us . everton have battered us overall
liverpool proving how good they really are when they come up against good teams
everton fans , your team are only improving him for chelsea .
cone on liverpool !
crazy derby lƒ±ver vs everton
serves us right everton well better team
only thing i'm happy about right now is next year lukaku will be demolishing everton the same way he's doing it to liverpool now
 is probably the best loanee-striker the premier league has ever seen . west brom last season and now .
finally got it up and running . hold on everton !
yes everton !!!
omg everton can't win then it'll mess up man us points
if i were manager i'd look back to the bench to allen and give him a fuck

everton wanted it more from the start , they deserve a win , mignolet had been amazing for liverpool , could have been worse
thomas signed a form saying if liverpool won the league he'd eat his own shit , so it makes me kind of sad that the kop are bottle merchants
you'll never walk alone liverpool‚ô•

in the gym listening to the merseyside derby on the radio and watching the rugby on tv having a bit of a 
not good enough today liverpool . poor in possession , created very little in open play .
everton getting rid of moyes is the best thing they've done . moyes never won a merseyside derby and martinez could the first time asking
think united playing everton next tooo enuh ! gonna be a hard game !
i swear eventon roll ball over liverpool rite about now
wanted to ask my dad for money but he's a liverpool fan and we're watching the match :( ....
everton beat liverpool ? 
everton getting stronger , so liverpool take off a midfielder and put on a striker .
joe allen has been smuggled out of liverpool in a burka
no less than everton deserve . arsenal should tap up lukaku ..
fuck off liverpool
people can whoop fuckin whoop about lukaku scoring for everton against others , it still pisses me right off hes out on loan in the 1st place .
c'mon liverpool !!!
a liverpool loss would be most undeserved . clearly the better team are losing
i don't see everton as top 6 . this ain't good . quite a few players who've been v poor today . gerrard . johnson . allen . agger .
bless the everton fans celebrating a lead like a title though .
if liverpool aren't in the top 3 by january 
liverpool go everton nyash go find wetin de smell ....
i don't wanna see joe allen in a liverpool shirt again
everton should have about six goals . outclassing liverpool . better manager also . still time for someone to score either way . fun game .
please liverpool , please !!!

i'm gonna start crying if liverpool don't score another goal tonight .
merseyside is blue ..
1 more everton . come on .
everton are winning !!! ez
lukaku is such a beast !!!!! 3-2 everton !!!
funny the way everton fans only sing when they are winning
can u see after lukaku's header , everton's manager shake hands with the 4th ref . he is bribing for sure
moyes would have gone for the 2-2 if he was still everton manager
liverpool . ah !
everything's fucked now ffs everton
everton claiming full points merseyside derby
i'm fcking exhausted ! cmon everton !!! 
everton ! everton !! everton !!!! 
only liverpool ...
is lukaku's headed goal v liverpool an indictment against man marking corners ? if that had come from a zonal system there'd be 1,000 critics
liverpool horribly bottled it when it matters . another reason why we won't make top 4 .
everton winning 3-2 , wasnt expecting that
hahahaha fuck off liverpool
ehehe .... everton making ma dÃÖÃ≤Ã∂Ã•aÃÖÃ≤Ã∂Ã•Œ≥Ã≤Ã£Ã£ ... yea !!!!!!!! epl getting interesting !

everton deserve the 3 points .. if liverpool get the draw everton can feel well a truly robbed !!
and that was how lukaku raped liverpool fc ...
can't believe liverpool are loosing
desperately want liverpool to win‚öΩÔ∏è
if liverpool are going to lose it , it's all joe allen's fault for not scoring the simplest of goals
waw what a derby ! many saves from mignolet , brilliant play from everton and romelu lukaku !
wow everton fans actually singing for once
everton please win !
liverpool need therapy ...... for fears against being anally raped
worst support in england ! fucking sing when there winning ! fuck off u cunts !

match of the season here but it should be 5-5 with easy misses and great saves 
liverpool are a fucking joke
so happy i didn't put liverpool in my football bet , can enjoy this .
derby merseyside also got interesting ..
i really thought liverpool would hammer everton ! 
interesting early kick-off game for the scores everton 3 - 2 liverpool
i really wanted liverpool to win ):
but merseyside derby is usually the best ..... followed by the north london one ..
lukaku scores a brilliant header to pull everton in front 3-2 of liverpool . second goal from lukaku .
also who would have thought everton and southampton would be the only 2 teams to only have lost 1 game so far this season . nice open league !
come on everton hold on
everton's scored another ? :d
save the 2 set piece goals by liverpool , they've been outplayed here today .

everton comeback bhai
lukaku already proved his worth when he's on loan at wba last season , & again this season at everton . why did chelsea loan him out again ?
everton are the scum of the earth
lukaku is world class . 3rd best player in the world at the mo behind ronaldo and messi .

everton should use him to his max . while he is on loan this season . 
wish they'd stop panning onto the everton crowd 
joe allen is getting blamed for this one by every liverpool fan on my timeline lol
4 - romelu lukaku has scored more goals against liverpool than any other premier league side ( four) . beast ."
just like to congratulate phil dowd and joe allen on allowing everton to get back into this game when they deserved absolutely nothing !
see what i mean ? liverpool fans hate him now lol
lukaku is killin ' them softly ! 
bwahahahaha ...... are losing this one definitely , all they can pride in as such would be a draw .....
this was definitely a match worth getting up early for ! 
lukaku is a tank holy fuck !!! mon liverpool
suarez should join arsenal , he deserves better than liverpool .
everton been the better side throughout the game really but they should have definitely should have been down to 10 a long time ago ..
exquisite everton .
85 ' barcelona 3-2 liverpool .
if liverpool lose üôåüôå
now everton lead 3-2 versus liverpool . kevin mirallas and lukaku scored

yessss everton
genuinely embarrassed to support liverpool at times , ahhhhhhhh so angry
everton thisüôà‚öΩÔ∏è
lukaku is from chelsea~ sturridge is from chelsea ... now everton vs liverpool .. i choose ..... chelsea !!!
can liverpool bring it back level ?
 are like saying to " what are you doing up there , come down lad "
joe allen will be one hated man if liverpool do lose
liverpool fans & stupid excuses
fucking knew everton would win this
liverpool is fuckin ' with the boys in blue
what a derby till now everton 3-2 liverpool !! brendan rodgers fucked liverpool's midfield with those changes
omg im dreaming of a 5 point lead again but its bloody forever away :( come on arsenal and everton !!
wow everton is leading .. c'mon lads hang on
liverpool should count themselves lucky that they've only conceded three goals .
people , stop yelling at joe allen for missing a chance . everton should've been doen to 10 men and allen's defense is the real problem .
oh , now you're just showing off , lukaku . everton are looking down upon moyes/fellaini in the table and that's just too good .
typical liverpool cant hold onto a simple lead
most likely moyes gine thief 2 everton players in january lol
what a bullet header by lukaku . liverpool would rue their missed chances[allen and sturridge ] 
its better if it ends a or win 
yes everton !
everton no way !!!!!!
2 goals in 5 mins , come on liverpool . never thought i would be shouting on liverpool
" go find your dad go find your dad liverpool go find your dad " üòÇ
this game has been great theatre . about to take down 
two goodison derbies in a row that a ref's incompetence will be a factor . this second half has been terrible from liverpool
everton win southampton win southampton are 2nd lol
liverpool please score ..... come on !
wanna see liverpool draw though
liverpool is a small team , period ! 
 towering 84 " header from ck powers into goal 3 2 in pulsating 
that is why i bet on liverpool to win cause i never win on the first game of the day ;)
everton fans literally went crazy .
jolly entertaining game of fooootball . 
oh my word everton

everton singing they are the besy team the world has ever seen is as realistic as wyocombe singing that
everton !!: )
liverpool over confident
what a comeback by . shows their strength this season . serious top 4 contenders
thumping header from the increasingly impressive great game this everton probably shading it all in 
lukako has nailed liverpool another goal its now #3 -2

lukaku again !! liverpool 2-3 everton . amazing 7 goal in 8 appearance with everton . 
it's everton ground . what you expect . but still . unfair bitch !

lukaku !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i have always been a fan of there's because of 
liverpool half time , everton full time was always the bet to have

c'mon everton
and everton take the lead 
score one liverpool
liverpool is a good team which includes players who have no determination to win
people , stop yelling at joe allen for missing a chance . everton should've been down to 10 men and allen's defense is the real problem .
everton with 3 at the back ? wingbacks create space in the middle for the carriers to burst through . poor by rodgers to bring on moses first .
everton fans singing lauder

liverpool fans all got pork belly mouth , look like billy trim
liverpool everton is one of the most entertaining games i've seen in a long time , quality both teams just end to end
liverpool r down
even liverpool lose this match then also their on affect their fans and players because they already won league oct . 
and deserve the lead . mignolet kept them out single handedly until lukaku‚Äôs double .
liverpool which had been leading twice now find themselves trailing . brilliant comeback fr the hosts
football is a fucking farce , everton just being given a player like lukaku . feel fucking sick
go on everton !
liverpool why just why
everton are sick i don't understand some people
everton have got to be the luckiest cunts alive
fuck you everton

goal everton 3-2 liverpool ( 82 mins) . romelu lukaku powers a header past simon mignolet from a corner 
wouldn't mind a last minute liverpool goal .

liverpool coach is fuckn da team leave a winning team stop choppin n changing
i know everton is not just about fellaini , they have a lot of very talented players . i know
lmao my father and bro swearing at the tv because liverpool is losing right now .
did say 3 2 to everton though fuck liverpool
getting funny looks here from a pub that erupted when liverpool scored !! 
in other news liverpool is under siege
everton tore us apart üòëüòëüòëüòëüòë
fuck off liverpool last time i put money on them
is liverpool playing with 10 men or is moses going to do anything .
wow !!! lukaku !! damn you ! everton 3 liverpool 2 !! lmfao !!
johnson has had a stinker for liverpool today but the better team is winnin , liverpool wasted 2 great chances they've punished liverpool !
this game is turnt up 3-2 everton right now
everton pulls a ...... a tyranny of goals against liverpool
sat here praying for everton to win so my baba will be happy 
what a derby it's turning out to be ...!!! great persistence from everton . proper derby attitude . 
i love everton !!!
liverpool is in wat to loss happy time
fuck off liverpool
free kick for liverpool
never underestimate everton !
that's it ! that's merseyside lost !
liverpool losing . an arsenal and chelsea defeat today , united win tomorrow and it will be the best weekend in a while
imagine i swapped out lukaku for remy in my fantasy team .... on the flip side , thanks everton .
liverpool come on
liverpool fans really should stop moaning about dowds officiating . suarez got away with a much worse offence last year against chelsea ...
come on everton !
maintain this scoreline until the final whistle , don't let liverpool get 3 points , not even 1 point ! haters gonna hate ! 
mignolet made some great saves earlier on and tim howard hasn't really made any big saves , evidence of everton's dominance for the game
everton could easily have scored 5 or 6 , if not for minoglet .
wtf ... until liverpool get rid of rubbish like henderdon , johnson & allen they will continue being an average side
our defending has been laughable . everton have cut us open a few times and had a man over . that's it even mentioned set prices .
liverpool can't lose
now i can never go back to liverpool fuck this
que grande derby de liverpool !!
go on everton !
the belgians doing all the goal scoring for everton . üòÅ
im friends with the monster that scored with his head ( 8) ... everton fans right now
my friend ( who's a liverpool fan ) told me to look at the table by the end of the day : " liverpool will be first by night time " waste man .
a big massive well done to liverpool for fucking this up you bunch of fucking mups !!!!
that's was how liverpool laana ... 
is now time for liverpool to also show dat dey can com back 
dear , i love the work you're doing today .

everton kicking off my saturday with a smile üòÅ
sial ah liverpool
oh wow everton
oh liverpool
can't stand everton hope they stand in shit
liverpool for the title ? they are not even the best team in liverpool ! 
liverpool fans have to realize gerrard isn't the dominate force he once was .
merseyside is blue
what a comeback ! lukaku the hero for today . 
everton has some of the shittiest fans 
was so close to putting 3-2 everton . chose 3-2 liverpool instead . 
liverpool shouldn't have played lucas n agger #3 -2 
i think is over for liverpool .... everton 3-2 liverpool .
i am not an everton fan .. but yay ! goooooaaal ......
that the hell is happening ?! is rocking ! 
winding him up when liverpool is behind is when i'm at my element . that stuff should be recorded . good craic .
some very effective substitutions by rogers since liverpool went 2-1 up
everton should also be playing with 10 men
liverpool is just a shitty team ..
thank fuck i never put liverpool on my coupon !
everton football club you are not the greatest team the world has ever seen
the merseyside derby turns our house into bloody liverpool - every scouser within a 5 mile radius is here
if everton win the game i'm happy , if it's a draw i'm happy cause i bet on the draw . 
now thinking straight that liverpool , arsenal are going where they deserve . biutiful mufc is uping !!!!
come on everton crush liverpool please we need them to lose
martinez > rodgers ... i know one game doesn't prove much but i could never understand why liverpool would pick rodgers ? martinez is king
who's winning out of everton or liverpool cbf to look its effort
make liverpool loose make chelsea fit climb jere ...
if liverpool score hay i eat my hand .
lukaku is rapeing the premier league liverpool twitter !
everton are doing well to get back in

lmao @ liverpool

how did it feel to be at the top for that few mins liverpool lmaoooo
come on everton .
 is my new favorite soccer club
wenger said by the end of november you‚Äôll know who real contenders are , looks like it‚Äôs find for liverpool to head back down mid-table .
lakaku is too good for everton . no idea why chelsea loaned him out
lukaku with is second goal of the match to put everton in front . is now 3-2 in favour of everton
come on everton . protect the gunners at all costs . 
when we was getting best by arsenal we still did , liverpool fans always do
liverpool fans should be easy tbh mignolet has made the scorline respectable
this really has been an absolute pleasure to watch . roberto martinez take a bow . you have inspired the everton faithful .
i knew lukaku would do this as soon as he went to everton , that's why i was desperate for him to stay at chelsea or go back to west brom
they wonder why tv figures for scottish football as so low ? spfl game at same time as everton/liverpool . ridiculous . why not friday night ?
merseyside derby has to be the best competition n english football .
come on toffeeman 
sometimes i really feel frustrated . and i wanna give up on liverpool
fuck everton .
unlucky liverpool
liverpool fans must be stressed loooool
ha ! everton with 5 defenders . real nyak play
frankly speaking , if it wasn't for mignolet , everton would probably be 5-2 up right now . been immense today .
lukaku puts everton a goal up . let's see if suarez gets back . 
liverpool must not loose this game !
i wonder how this game would've gone if everton were down to 10 like they should've been in the 1st half . 
live update everton 3 liverpool 2 4mins remaining
mad liverpool is mad
feel harsh on liverpool
i wonder what would've happened if martinez was appointed liverpool manager hmmm
what a game between liverpool n everton ; good warm up for the arsenal 
common everton
i can't be sure why the cosmos decided to get me out of bed early enough to watch this merseyside derby , but i am highly grateful .
hahaha love seeing liverpool fans get mad
come on everton . biar liverpool kalah .
its time to play fifa vs everton on amiture

everton virou , que fase hein liverpool

" i ave neva seen a derby as tough as this everton vs liverpool "
liverpool cmon draw pls
this would be only everton's second comeback win against liverpool since the end of world war ii . 
deloufeu managed to fall over himself and somehow liverpool got a free kick
james is nearly in tears because liverpool are losing .. üòÇüòÇ
liverpool :'(
mourinho did awesome job by sending lukaku to everton and destroy top teams and chelsea need to take advantage by not droping silly points
tbf everton deserve the win .. but kevin mirrallas has deserved a red card 3 times .
everton was meant to be playing with 10 men anyway .. fucking cunts
come on everton hold on

liverpool derby at 1am .. different way of viewing the premier league
a merseyside derby is the most important game in any season
everton need to just hold on and and take the points
 2t i everton 3x2 liverpool 
that everton number 10 is the worst player i've ever seen
hold on to this everton !
where would everton be without lukaku
fuck , fuck , fuck can't believe another goal to everton ...... everton 3-2 liverpool
come on liverpool
my bad -over excitement : p 's 3-2 to everton ! 
after having the lead twice , you are now losing liverpool . well bloody done you tossers üòí 
 good to see you losing .
always had a soft spot for everton against their corporate mewling monolith rivals .
yes man everton !!!
this is why i don't watch liverpool matches more time lol no faith
get in there everton !!!!!!!!
liverpool you bag of wank
lool liverpool , who scored ?
get in ! everton . hold on to this now .
get behind your team no matter what ! everton fans have remembered how to do this since the second half 
had a feeling everton would pull it back
everton really a beat liverpool
everton wonderful lukaku killed liverpool
fuck off everton
come on liverpool get a draw
i'll still never turn my back on liverpool
everton can suck my small balls .!! had a desmond .
everton !!! what a game . you can't give 17 that space off a corner . 
chance of liverpool defending a set piece ? wank cunts
that everton number 10 is pants .
come on everton !!!!!!!
surely if joe allen had scored that easy goal we'd be in the lead , everton just would have had the impetus they do now
so fast !!!!! everton .
i wasn't gonna let anything ruin my day but liverpool are doing a pretty good job tbh
 : 4 - romelu lukaku has scored more goals against liverpool than any other premier league side ( four) ... !
hahha fak actuallyyyyy liverpool kinda deserved it laaaaa
everton should be a man down . we should of scored to make it 3:1 before what a joke everton don't deserve it !
i said just before the corner everton where going to score again . if allen would of scored . wonder what would have happened .. such a poor miss
why did chelsea loan lukaku to everton ? not like torres and ba is anywhere as good in front of goal
i'm a liverpool fan and my dad is an everton fan you could cut the tension with a knife
liverpool ! payah !
lol liverpool ...
yyaasss c'mon everton . intae these fucking wanks
everton doing me proud !!
c'mon liverpool !!
allen scores that and there is no everton comeback .
liverpool are shite
everton tho ...
chelsea send lukaku out on a season long loan to rt if you think mourinho is a fool .
i'm gonna be miserable whilst watching catching fire thanks a fucking lot liverpool
this match changed for everton when deulofeu entered the match . created penetration consistently . excellent runs & movement
lukaku !!!! 3-2 with 7 minutes left . dagger in the heart of liverpool
one word " lukaku " with every goal for his current employers everton making mourinho look like more and more of an imbecile . 
3-2 ... liverpool should know peole
c'mon liverpool you've gotta score
equalize lah liverpool !!!!!
ouch ! pierde el liverpool 2_3 :(
conclusion : squad selection was all wrong , dowd allowing every liverpool forward to get snapped and allen's dismal miss .
eeveerrtooonnn !!!! romelu is easily the best summer signing this season in my opinion 
great game this how can u leave lukaku all alone in the box ? sucicidal from liverpool . hopefully the boro game can b just as good
 on the verge of a rare mersyside bragging right in well over 20years .
everton v liverpool has been a great game 
wtf liverpool !
what a come back 3 liverpool 2
i love you everton <3
everton have no fucking money , they just get loaned players the cheap pricks
when i watch everton 1-2 liverpool when i off everton 3-2 liverpool . ok

my boy lukaku is owning the merseyside derby !
although i'm so happy everton's playing v well against liv , im also damn sad . it just proves that moyes is not strong manager . & he's ours .
lukaku is an idiot ! wot a way to break the hearts of liverpool wth a super header !
liverpool fans are so funny when they're losing
liverpool showing true colours now
liverpool one ... carnage !!!
the everton comeback i predicted , i hate being right .
lukaku gets everton the lead 3-2 
bet liverpool win diss
the fact everton should of been down to ten men in the first half and that allen missed the easiest if chances is sickening !

dari allen miss and easy goal tdi da tau its gonna end bad for liverpool . :(
past few weeks liverpool fans think they've already won the premier league , liverpool ain't winning shit this season . üòä
fair play to everton here bossed the second half .. barkley and flanagan have been immense ... but allen you prick missing that chance !
1 ) mirallas should be off 2 ) allen should have scored 3 ) everton's second should never have been a free kick 3 ) lukaku is a beast .
if delafou was a good finisher everton would be winning by 2 or 3 goals 
liverpool is not playing well tonight :/ haizz
suarez nearly scores from close range header , but the everton keeper did wel to deny him .
everton !
everton 3 - 2 liverpool partidazoo

can't wait for the liverpool vs cardiff game next month
fair to say that it had been coming . liverpool have been conceding too many chances . rodgers subs left them too exposed in the back
whoever runs everton's twitter account probably shouldn't .
retweet if you're laughing at liverpool
liverpool sud berra draw dis match
jesus christ i hope liverpool win because my holiday will be ruined .. 
5 - liverpool have scored just five goals in the second half of their previous 11 pl games this season , conceding seven . worry ."

c'mon liverpool !
horunge lag liverpool
wholly undeserved win for cheating everton today .
fabulous game . everton vs liverpool

everton liverpool has been some game
i don't care what anyone says , jose mourinho is a genius . do you know how smart a move it was to loan lukaku to everton ?

hold on everton . hold on .
as it stands table 1 arsenal 11 12 25 2 liverpool 12 10 23 3 everton 12 5 23 4 southampton 11 10 22 5 chelsea 11 8 21
i don't think any one game more polarizes celtic fans than the liverpool derby - we're all completely split down the middle .
if i had a gun id be my way to liverpool to put a bullit in joe allans fucking head !
joe allen should never play for liverpool again .. what on earth was rodgers thinking with his team selection and substitutions today ??! 
everton have outnumbered liverpool defenders on quite a few occasions this half ..
liverpool wined me up la !
haha thats the job everton
what did i tell you liverpool are shit 3-2 
the merseyside derby . nothing like it in sports
good result for the gunners if everton can nick this for us to stay on top until we trash southampton later .
if liverpool loose and arsenal win i'll be soo happy
whoop go everton !
i love liverpool but we played a stupid game against everton today . 
come on liverpool üòî
* liverpool
played everton
 : assist kevin mirallas provided the corner from which romelu lukaku powered home everton's third goal .
liverpool was playing well in the first half
it really sucks if you're at croatian school , the everton liverpool game is pretty sick .
signing of the summer by far is lukaku to everton .
this kid in everton nah wates
1 more mi want everton fi fully seal it
liverpool best get there act together soon !
stupid sia liverpool
are we going to have an outbreak of stupidity from our fans every time lukaku scores ? get a grip . bet he's happy he went everton
please give some miracle to liverpool liverpool 2 everton 3 ...
latest news : liverpool has been regelated . lol
everton don't deserve this
i have been to liverpool once . but i‚Äôd like to go there again‚Ä¶ just so i can slap joe allen .
merseyside derby , soccer saturday , dortmund vs bayern , froch vs groves , city vs spurs , cardiff vs united , survivor series not a bad weekend
cantekk !! go everton ! go everton !
wish i was at home watching my dad start dancing because everton has pulled this back 
well that's the end of that then . liverpool have lost their fucking minds ! 
liverpool hustling
everton are banging idc
c'mon everton !
i hate you lukaku . n u , everton
liverpool's defense has been a joy to watch today
lukaku is a baller , glad i'm in liverpool to join in the celebrations 
everton side a play ball man ..
cannot cope !!!!!! 
martinez substitutions have been spot on today . won & pet momentum , more attacking threat to pin liverpool back ! deserve 3-2 lead 
hold on everton
even though liverpool win , lose or draw i will still always support liverpool !
liverpool is shit
wonderful stuff from the merseyside derby .. especially with that disgraceful cheat being on the losing end
credit where it's due everton have worked there arse off for this , liverpool looked like they thought they won it at 2-1 and slacked off !
everton wins and we have to win tomorrow .
for fuck sake liverpool -_-
lukaku ! gooooal ! 3 ! - 2 fantastic match ! stand up & take a bow ! 606
3-2 we're losing , dam not a good birthday present come on liverpool 
liverpool are moving boookie
painful to watch liverpool's defence today - except for mignolet
everton are playing an interesting brand of football . 
liverpool should keep the score like that
liverpool blind nd relax , lukaku just opened their eyes‚ò∫ , 
just can't see liverpool getting one back . plenty of time left . anything can happen . c'mon everton hang on .
i like when score .... his celebration is somewhat entertaining , lol . what a beautiful header that was to take the lead . 
that 0-0 draw at everton doesn't look so bad now does it you moany cunts .
great game fair play everton . allens miss was crucial but for me agger is such a liability at the back needs to be moved on now
liverpool are more like liverfools !
i'm i correct in seeing the biggest club in merseyside r winning 3-2 & that a chelsea striker scored 2 of them mawhahaha ‚öΩÔ∏è
everton is too good this year
hang in there everton !! 4mins !
get in there everton 2-1 down now 3-2 up haha lovely lukaku is such a beast fuck off liverpool
liverpool have one of the ugliest team in the prem
3-2 everton now , it's what you get for missing a sitter . joe allen , i'm never going to forgive you .
this is derby merseyside !
rogers has gambled for the win here with his subs and it's backfired big time . some comeback from everton though ! 
liverpool trash .. üò©üòÇ
come on liverpool go get that one point ! 
right now .. everton are 3rd on d table .. same pts with liverpool 23
ffs liverpool you shit cunts joe allen is a disgrace
everton still unbeaten at home this calender year .
apparently mourinho loaned lukaku 2 everton so he could trouble big teams . i don't like that man but he's too shrewd .
i like how martinez joins everton and they improve and how moyes joins united and they get worse 
meanwhile romelu lukaku is doing more damage to arouna kone and jelavic than liverpool .
liverpool lose now , arsenal lose later and united win tomorrow 
well , joe allen should of scored , and kevin mirallas shouldn't be on the pitch . but everton simply played better than liverpool today
now everton is gna stoot tyd
haha , lost connection xame back to a 3-2 lead ... go everton !
3-2 everton leading . i did mention earlier everton are full of surprises . guess i'm right liverpool back to reality .
liverpool failed to win this game when allen folishly failed to square for suarez
nothing better than premier league football . liverpool lose , we win . happy days 
good everton !!!!
if allen scored that goal and liverpool were winning right now they'd fucking bum him ! 
look how many chances have been given away by liverpool in the second half . shocking .
this barca guy in everton is a genius ...
i don't want to be that guy but technically everton should be down to 10 men ...
that's a proper derby atmosphere 
come on , liverpool ! don't make me regret waking up at 4.45 am . 
i'm laughing at liverpool haha xd
lukaku fucking made üëå‚öΩÔ∏è fuck off liverpool
hull v palace is going to need 23 red cards and a unicorn entering the field to get on motd before this everton game

 alive with the sound of a winning !
everton are shit aswell , fucksake
sad liverpool sad . you will walk with tears .

i hope this is the end of the idea that allen is liverpool's future .

liverpool not hungry enough 
nothing more stressful than being a liverpool fan
good job everton !! nice comeback
c'mon liverpool > : ( 
liverpool aren't in the title race and they never were . 
liverpool's fight for 5th place with spurs starts today .
theres only one side on merseyside !
and it's cost your team a win in the merseyside derby 
left house for catching fire , liverpool end up losing . sigh .
my dad's here cheering on liverpool .
come on everton !
no worries , liverpool will still win the league 
dont really know wat tactics are today think its let everton through as many times as we can !!! played awful
ama be gutted if liverpool equalises ...
can't believe chelsea have managed to win a merseyside derby 
outstanding performance by romelu lukaku ! 3-2 now and everton leading !
liverpool will never learn . stupid niqqas
i forgot to say thanks to joe allen thanks la 
 showing superiority over 3 - 2
come on everton . just keep it up .
ahaha liverpool chins must be so low
i had a dream that everton would win hahahahha
they said they will beat arsenal , they said they will beat everton . tears for this uefa cup side

merseyside still blue 
liverpool just broke my heart , i will stick realmadrid saa
liverpool are fuming loooooool
i still think liverpool will get a draw out of this game , at least 
everton till i die üòç
conceivably , liverpool could end the weekend in 6th , having started in 2nd . gd suggests unlikely , but the top 8/9 is so close in the epl .
coutinhos probably more creative than every everton player combined
nooooo fuck you everton üò©
merseyside derby ... now this is football ....
's defending is absolute rubbish right now .... 
half of everton's squad is loan
liverpool are just wasting so much possession
lukaku has played terrible but scored 2 just like drogba did a lot and saved us and lukaku has saved everton
üò±oh dear liverpool .. üòÇüòÇ
liverpool have looked shit at the back
liverpool don't deserve to be top of the league with performances like this .
no doubt everton will be releasing a dvd tomorrow 
kut liverpool
fuck liverpool
i just wish he was doing this for us at chelsea and not at everton
mehn wats up with liverpool
what a good day to not be a liverpool fan ! oh dear liverpool üôà
liverpool 3-2 down ! yes
come on everton !
well done everton .
liverpool walkin alone in the boulevard of a broken barclay's dream .
everton are on their way to enter the top 4 slot . if they win then they will be at 3rd spot behind liverpool . 
wow , leave the house liverpool 2-1 up my bet looking good , get to the stadium 3-2 down . fucking shite cunts
everton's best player is phil dowd
everton-liverpool quite enjoyable right now 
" 4 - romelu lukaku has scored more goals against liverpool than any other premier league side ( four) . beast ."
liverpool back to normal hahahaha
please everton , hold on to it !
but liverpool dropping points is great news !
fairplay to liverpool and everton they've gave a great game to us in a neutral position
well played 2nd half everton . game just proved yet again how shot we are at defending set pieces . utter joke 
everton should be playing with fucking 10 men .... this is stupid .
phil dowd and joe allen have cost liverpool today
everton will already
just when i was still writin abt everton gettin a late winner .
i reckon everton can push us all the way for the type this year .

liverpool oh üòÇüò≠üòÖüò± dont make me sad

" suarez with the cross , nobody there " - same old liverpool

everton's official twitter is gng nuts omg they're fangirling in capslock wtf this is too cute

just hope everton hold on and win this game , 3years since they beat liverpool in the league . 
if any everton fan can say they deserve 3pts they got some fucked up disability jesus christ
nooo liverpool :'(
everton taking this piss now , here comes osman .
no top of the table for liverpool
everton !!
out of everyone for the chance to fall to , it fell to an avatar looking little prick ! he doesn't deserve to be playing for liverpool .
remember when martinez was struggling to keep wigan in the league ? look where he is now . a great managerial signing for everton .
kamon everton u can do it
everton have gone into delirium while liverpool are starting to dig themselves into a hole
liverpool = small club , big history .
and the 1st half to second half contrasts for liverpool continue .
everton !!! yeah !!! : v
i hope liverpool equalise and it's a draw so nobody feels too upset about the game :)
fed up of liverpool bullshit . same excuse all the time
well played everton . they were the better side .
wow . liverpool are shit . we can't do anything right .
yeeaah ! its now 3~2 to everton
everton have deserved this . but referee and joe allen need to ava word
liverpool php banget :(
fgs liverpoolüòí
im not taking anything away from everton . they have played well but i cant help but feel cheated by the ref and joe fucking allen
woah without moyes everton are going to be 3rd omg
everton dey hot 
come on you everton !
get in everton !!
goal !!! lukaku strikes again and the goal keeper could do just notin .. everton 3-2 liverpool
suck that liverpool !
everton 3_2 liverpool ( 87mins )
everton vs liverpool and the best on the pitch is a chelsea player hah
would love martinez to get a result here . go on everton .
oooh everton winning the derby ? nice one ! helps us ;-d
roberto mancini is really doing the business for everton . 
liverpool's defence is not top 4 worthy ... like flanagan ?
i , of course , am cheering on everton .
everton vs liverpool is one of the most intresting games of this season !!
liverpool 2 everton 3
liverpool how market ? lmfao !!!
one of my predictions of how this will end : liverpool will get the balotelli treatment in the last minute .
merseyside derby for everton .. :-(
liverpool cant just rely on suarez to win games someone else needs to step up
its ok liverpool . no choice ...
calm down the play and take a breath , liverpool keep attacking so fast resulting in getting quickly dispossessed . everton just counter .
fantastic game of football being played at the moment - end to end with great skills - latest score everton 3 liverpool 2
i tot sas could rap everton down ? lol
 liverpool are so screwed
as long as it's liverpool .. lukaku must score
i would happily take a draw though . just needed to be sure liverpool weren't getting the 3 points
merseyside is blue
the world was rosie at 2-1 liverpool .... now the old cliches are coming out ... allen shit johnson shit br shit ... shit formation blah blah
 ... oh my word !!!
liverpool's goalkeeper did most of the defending for them today so this performance from everton is no shock at all ....
everton yo
liverpool go !!!
liverpool rely on suarez and sturridge too much when they dont play liverpool dont play simple
omg ! everton is 3 and liverpool is 2 . what a match this one ! 
" mehn those everton fans wouldn't be celebrating any more if they'd won the lottery . wah a game !"
have to say , this was always coming for liverpool with the amount of chances they've been giving away
every single braid on lukaku's head is enough for each of everton+l'pool starting 11 . 
if u start joe allen u deserve this 
and flanagan isn't ready to play these games .. not against everton and not against arsenal ..
apparently everton are going for the title !
all the liverpool fans who laughed when we lost to the mackems ... ermmm
i've only been out the room a short while . i'm sure liverpool was winning 1-2 !
please tell me it is actually 3-2 to everton and the internet isn't lying to me ?
although i'm not a fan of liverpool , but stop tweet the " rt if your laughing at liverpool .". it's not funny .
in your liverpool slums , you cant get a job cos your to fucking thick , you find a dead rat and think its a treat in your liverpool slims
everton should be playing with 10 men . mirallas should have been sent off .
never get any sleep when everton are playing early kickoff , my dad just shouting at the tv for about 2 hours . 
merseyside is blue .
merseyside ! 
everton three goals all from belgians
shouldn't be letting a lead slip to a shit team like everton
likely destroyed liverpool !
there are very few things in life more satisfying than the sight of the liverpool end when their team is losing .
bpl latest : everton 3 - 2 liverpool 5 minutes plus stoppage time left 
i regret picking imgur over streaming everton liverpool ...
sigh liverpool üò∞
wow do i hate everton now like fuck the ref for not giving a red . if suarez did that he would be banned 15 games fuck this bullshit fa
nice game everton ...
lukaku put liverpool in their place stilll
everton are gonna win this one , not sure how tho 
liverpool just be liverpool ,, like they used to !
yes everton !
i got up early for this ? ffs 
 has to be everton's standout star really doesn't it ? the referee
this would be only everton's second comeback win against liverpool since the end of world war ii ( bbc )
everton 3-2 liverpool ! what a game this has been !

liverpool need to realise that a football game last 90 minutes not 45 minutes

haha these liverpool fans look terrified

liverpool had a one on one chance but missed
please everton hold out
this merseyside derby is one for the ages !!! lukaku !! 
goal ! everton 3-2 liverpool ( 82 mins) . romelu lukaku's header past mignolet from a corner . good stuff .
lukaku brushing off glen johnson 2 head in potential winner for everton in the merseyside derby . liverpool with disappearing act in 2nd half
i would like to see how this game went on if everton were rightly down to ten men , none the less , it's not an excuse .
what an excellent game for a neutral . everton vs liverpool - can they hold on ? 3-2 everton . who is your mam of the match ?
everton and lfc match is very epic
apparently mirallas played a crucial part in both of everton's last two goals . how controversial is that , liverpool fans will complain .

somewhere within goodison , a member of everton's marketing department tentatively breaks open the cellophane on a new pack of dvdrs .
whenever liverpool lose i seem to have a shit day !
it looks like liverpool will be defeated
who scored the first goal for everton
get in the everton
wonder if liverpool fans will still defeated rodgers ? 
reckon it will be 4-2 ft to everton fs
to be fair , everton have been the better team in the second half , but the fact the guy who should've been sent off is clapped off is a joke
fuck off everton
liverpool are shit . who even suggested we're in the title race .

all these liverpool fans blaming joe allen oh god hahaha
my saturday is pretty much perfect , everton v liverpool , f1 qualifying , dortmund v munich then froch v groves tonight 
and its everton !!! everton fc !!!!!!!!
haha just seen that everton are winning
typical derby . bad refereeing decision , bad miss , loads of goals on and liverpool defending set pieces woefully .
lucas going off is just what everton needed ... barkley , barry and lukaku are now free to misbehave
liverpool please don't score
hate everton luckiest team ever
everton are evil tho
fucking hate everton !
lukakuuu ..!!!! and everton on top ..!!! being a manu fan i am supporting everton ..!!!
another offer from liverpool john moores this morning ! woooo
everton 3 - 2 liverpool
this is very same team that denied league the season before the previous 
joe allen must be sold in january . i didn't watch the game but i think that guy is not good for liverpool
 just seen a tweet sayinh rogers out , best start we have had in years , yes we are losing to everton but can't sack him on one game
liverpool paid ¬£15million for joe allen , laugh with me
oh my , what's happening liverpool : l üòÇ
predicted a 3-2 for the liverpool game let's see if it finishes like that
mirallas should have been sent off and joe allen should've scored !! everton have just been lucky , simple as ! 
games like this liverpool need to knuckle down man , too many times we have invited pressure onto us
some guy whom i think is a liverpool fan has been shouting for the whole neighborhood to hear whenever liverpool has a chance damn sian
top game and a great result in the merseyside derby . .. 
liverpool don't deserve it today ! too many players having a bad day ! gerrard johnson ... allen my granny couldve scored that !
lool gerrard sold suarez dreams when convincing him to stay at liverpool
everton's tactics spot on , can't say the same about liverpool
merseyside derby is classy today ...... 87th min everton 3 - 2 liverpoo cam on 
everton man of the match goes to ..... phil dowd
like i ain't arsed about who wins the derby i just enjoying lukaku destroying liverpool ! chelsea's number 9 next season ! 
mirallas had a hand in both the everton equaliser and 3rd goals 
as sad as it is seeing playing & scoring tonnes of goals for , its reassuring knowing that he's still a man .
go on everton . lakaku the beast !
come on everton get in
only thing that worried me about everton today was lukaku , then to see we don't start a physical cb like sakho to contain him .. poor .
osman in for everton . 
s3 moa y3 shi .... sia 
haha come on everton !
what a dope match between everton and liverpool
go liverpool !! go suarez !!!!
poor from liverpool overall , only a few players stepped up
fuck liverpool
go everton go !!
joe allen is so shit dont know why he is at liverpool
love watching arsenal and soton play so whoever wins i'm happy . liverpool ? lol no comments .
oh yeah everton good shit ! 
lol muke fans liverpool ..... nk nangis jer hahaha xd game not over yet ...... coyb !!
hahahahaahaahaha nah , the stupidity to blame allen for everton's win ... hahahahaahaahaha nah you man should be doing btec's in breathing
liverpool -_-
liverpool attack has been dull . no midfield creativity at all .
the cold wey go catch liverpool fans for that field go dey different !! oh !!
lol liverpool
keep calm everton
lukaku always scores against liverpool 3 for west brom and now 2 for everton
i can't hear from the liverpool fans
come on everton
everton could've had six
zz everton's gonna have the same points as us right ?
everton so strong this season
liverpool's second half performance shows why they will be no where near challenging for the title and will probably not challenge for 4th
you're fucked now liverpool ! here comes osman ......
c'mon everton
everton
everton's comeback
joe allen shouldn't wear a liverpool jersey forever !
fucking losing to everton you know
lfc threw this game away ... but phil dowd was everton's most important player . go figure .
yes everton !!
there's probably not a club in english football that gets better wage optimization than everton . 
joe allen should be at norwich not good enough to be a liverpool player
yes , come on everton !!!
come on everton
i could of sworn i just see everton losing and now they're winning
yesss 
liverpool were on top .... until b.r removed lucas and allen for moses and sturridge . allowed everton to seize control in the centre .
why did chelsea loan lukaku . üòí his header against liverpool . wow .
if moyes wanted to get an everton player shudda got miralla
if liverpool continues this poor run of result , i'm sorry , suarez would leave .
chai ! i be mumu for not betting on this everton oh ! e pain me die !
worst changes ever from liverpool
with everyone rooting for everton i'm guessing liverpool are no longer a mid table club ?
hot game ...! everton came to play waaaaaaaaar
liverpool crying , so much suffering . blame your system
come on everton
everton is goin 2 carry d day .. evt 3 vs liverpool2
liverpool .... walking alone @ goodison . park
yes ! get in everton ! hold on now
ghen ghen ... they'r skuling liverpool \o/
so everton should be ten men , we should have 3 goals , but no dowds fucking shit and allen is a fucking fanny !
lukaku has bossed liverpool well .
had our arses kicked here but should of never thrown that lead away , joe allen is gonna be in every liverpool fans nightmares tonight .
lukaku is tearing liverpool a new arse
liverpool make me suicidal sometimes .
 everton midfield ( barkley , barry ) is one of the best in pl
if it ends like dis , and united wins 2mao , we're gonna be level on points with liverpool ..
everton , have em ! xd
get in everton !!!!
liverpool up your game here !
mourinho must be regret right now for letting lukaku go on loan at everton .
and they said liverpool will be this years champion
roberto martinez is doing a good job at everton 
ohhhhhh everton we love youuuu
liverpool is almost losing
we all know everton should be down a man no excuses but for christs sake .
i wonder what was going on in allen's head when the everton goals went in
pergh ah everton .
liverpool kena come back everton :d
sigh , to be fair liverpool deserve at least a point from this game .
full hate for everton .
i think this one has gone . everton right now looking good for a win . i can‚Äôt complain . we didn‚Äôt make enough chances . we didn‚Äôt convert .
nice comeback by everton !
noüò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò† liverpool loosing to evertonüò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
everton cheat anyway you can loan a 20million striker
joe allen should never never put on a liverpool shirt again . and mirallas should have left the pitch a while ago
haha , piss off liverpool scum
watching the merseyside derby with cousins . all supporting everton haha
incredible game between everton and liverpool right now ! tim howard's a beast
liverpool liverpool liverpool !
liverpool making life easier for the gunners
i'm not the kinda person to slag off liverpool players but i'd actually sack joe allen that miss cost us the game
evertonians deserve success , especially at expense of liverpool . same goes for martinez who , as said before , i would've welcomed at spurs .
 was faded throughout until his double strike which puts everton ahead of liverpool 
the best team in liverpool is everton
everton beating liverpool is the best result for an arsenal fan atm
i really wanted liverpool to win
everton fans cant really be this blind and be cheering mirallas after the wretched afternoon hes had .
allen's miss wasn't the deciding factor . not sending off mirallas was what kept everton alive
 fans biting their nails - what a lovely sight 
liverpool are so shit away from home ! especially our midfield ! to be outclassed by this everton team shows how much of a joke we are
if everton play like this week-in week-out ... y'al shld b afraid !
fuck this filthy everton scum team
and they say liverpool will win the title ...
hmm ... what's going on with merseyside derby ? :d
this everton squad is a good squad
painful to watch liverpool's defence today . serius talk . argh
everton are chanting like peedos(moyes )
told you everton would win this game . hang in there !
lol me tell some man say them a go lose enuh ! u think everton a joke side
throwing my phone at the tele after everton just scored because when liverpool concede i react like someone just killed my family 
reality is beginning i hit liverpool this season ‚ò∫Ô∏è , theres levels to this
loooool but seriously why liverpool ???
keep defending everton
joe allen i can't deal he has to go , everton have been all over us they deserve to win
my prayers are ignored !! nice to see everton win their cup final though !! well done then
fuck you everton üò°
oh lukaku just scored twice for everton ? of course i sold him for loic remy this week on fantasy premier league !
everton have deserved this . they have been better this half . 3-2 if everton wins they are tied for 2nd with liverpool w/24 points
men liverpool is tripin yo how you gonna loose 3:2 from a 2:1 lead 
everton making my eve
everton one more goal jare make them learn -_-
its amazing how many people jump on the band wagon wen liverpool are getting beat , is it coz there own teams are that bad , 
go everton !
come on everton
if liverpool lose ... " ahhh mirallas shudda been sent off " üòÇ
everton knows how to do twitter
hezalop .. not liverpool that win pl last season
two big incidents we'll point to . mirallas should have been off and joe allen shocking miss . but everton have missed a lot of chances too .
fuck u la everton
liverpool lose liverpool lose liverpool lose .
sounds like i've missed a worldy merseyside derby ! also what the fuck are chelsea doing sending lukaku out on loan !? 
3rd everton goal - made in belgium
winds me up when people say " i want lukaku " etc .. he would be wasted at city and is at chelsea , i hope he everton buy him outright !
go'ed everton , bring on the pensioner to waste time ...
lukaku goal again ! everton 3 liverpool 2 ! why your liverpool :(
had a feeling liverpool would get beat . always do after international breaks
wooh chile everton ....... wooh chile
bizarre merseyside derby . rodgers went for broke with 2 attacking subs , everton picked them off . they were 4v2 on goal twice before scoring .
liverpool are not title contenders
just tuned in , everton leading liverpool 3-2 ! üò±
 must be ruing that miss now that are staring at defeat .
when liverpool fans start biting their fingers lol
man of the match today as got to be phill dowd to not send mirrales off was genius definately won the game for everton
everton wit ' it !!!
hang on there everton ! last few mins !
dramatis everton liverpool
lukaku is such a beast ! come on everton !
merseyside blue 3 - 2 merseyside red
wtf liverpool do something ?!!? %/@ "; %(
wow merseyside derby looks unreal
everton 3 - liverpool 2 . hmmpp
this match ought to be like 7-4 , in favour of everton ..... mignolet !
and the 1st half to 2nd half contrasts for liverpool continue .
brilliant merseyside derby today . gutted it looks like its gonna be a loss though
robbed in liverpool . now that's a new saying . not .
fuck liverpool !
i'm not anti i just think a massive section of their support let them down so on derby days , for me its all the way .
hehe liverpool !
everton ‚ô•
id rather lose 4-0 to arsenal chelsea united city etc than lose to everton .

5mint more . liverpool please do something - . -
merseyside derby at its best .... 
everton wrecked the liverfools 
come on liverpool :(
merseyside derby has been a sick game !

enough of the loan move ! come back home , lukaku ! you beast ! 3-2 . 
i can't take listening / watching liverpool any more , i feel physically sick from stress and it's gonna ruin my mood for the rest of the day
how many goals for lukaku against liverpool ? 
great merseyside derby .
looooool liverpool üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
liverpool have had 4 shots in ~72 minutes since going 2-1 up
why are liverpool always so shit in the 2nd half
made my saturday even better knowing liverpool are more than likely going to lose . now we need vale to loose 
liverpool da ggwp la . no need ‚Äú come on liverpool ‚Äù la hahaha !
man of the match mirallas comes off . great goal , great assist , great tackle on the lad with the face like a smashed piano . 
soon as i saw allen was starting i pissed myself and rightly fucking so . knew hed be the difference for everton
hm come on liverpool !!
the belgians doin it 4 everton
poor 3-2 
everton have run this today , they have played immense
same old liverpool .
knock em bitches down from first place üòé 
welp , so much for my " mirallas second yellow " prediction . smart subbing from mart√≠nez . 
fuck liverpool , i don't understand what the fuck they are playing
is it just me that thinks the merseyside derby is better then the london derby ( spurs and arsenal )
how are we fucking losing to everton
iv never felt more like singing the blues , when everton win an liverpool lose !!!
damn , lukaku is seriously killin liverpool players wey .
lukaku did with everton what he couldn't do with chelsea :d
yes everton !
liverpool's midfield doesnt exist . gerrard is class but he operates in slow motion these days . others dont offer enough quality or quantity .
liverpool you've bottled it ! chance for the title is gone now , oh well , champions league still hopefully 
joe allen should never be allowed near a liverpool shirt again .
i rate everton
 !!!!!
just seen the everton v liverpool score , that looks like a cracker . my mate lukaku scoring again .
my love for lukaku has gone through the roof 
lukaku didn't even have a great game . shows what happens when you work hard . all the time . 
please no ! someone score ! cannot fucking lose to everton !
everton wants to go unbeaten at home this season sha
liverpool have lost this one üòîüòîüòî
mourinho purposely loan lukaku to everton so they can beat the big teams lahüòå
c'mon liverpool !
romelu lukaku !!!!!!! can everton just go ahead and pay chelsea whatever it takes to keep him ?!?!? 
i really don't like everton . not the visceral hatred of man u , or chelsea . but still .
standing ovation for mirallas in my house now . for what he did to suarez rather than liverpool .
mignolet did great job , but everton still score 3 goals , terrible liverpool defense , respect to mignolet 
liverpool lose points ... fantasy points naik ... thanks to lukaku ..... lukaku jokes for everyone tonight
go on everton !!
everton have taken joe allen off , he has been there best player
allen showed today that he isn't good enough for liverpool
liverpool 3 everton 3 """"" goal """"""
should have put this game to bed , this is liverpool last season not putting games away
 beating bonus for me being arsenal fan üôå
everton are making me proud mehn !!
liverpool please . 
liverpool really shouldn't be losing to this pile of shite
loaning lukaku to everton is an absolute master stroke , he's gonna be a chelsea star for years after this experience
only current everton players i like are baines and deulofeu
nice liverpool
the gods seem to be on the everton's side today .
shebi i told my bro everton will beat liverpool , the guy nor believe
 keep it up liverpool !
00:00 -0700 cricket . 12:45 - 14:45 everton liverpool and rugby league semi . 15:00 - 17:30 formula 1 quali & other football . 18:00 - 20:00 rugby .

that everton fan pretending like he wasn't just slyly picking his nose before the camera went on him . i see you .
early start with the girls today 
everton fans where you at ?
liverpool woohooo
but bone . deulofeu brought a different dimension to this everton team . flanagan that was smiling in first half isn't doing so anymore
everton are just the best second team to like 
to be fair mignolet has been brilliant for liverpool
everton should only have 10 men . allen should of scored
everton-liverpool derby has been terrific . or as they'd say in england , it's been " a cracker " of a match . lukaku just a beast . 
go on everton
liverpool .. lmao
nothing makes me happier than hearing liverpool are losing ! fantastic !!!! hold on to it everton !

every other team in the epl have to do some incredible stuff to beat the thrill of this everton livpool game mehn !
 play like used to in the last 5 games of the season under martinez .
everton should've won , idiots .
aaaaaaand there we have it . 3-3 . see you around , other merseyside team .
everton are stunningly small time .
2 big mistakes 1 . not going out to watch liverpool vs everton 2 . betting on lukaku to score 3 ( 80-1 ) instead of 2 of more ( 18-1) !
what a merseyside derby ! 
anfield liverpool will win
i would of enjoyed that if i didn't support liverpool
everton unlucky not to get the win there but when luis is playing like that üôà
gosh that liverpool game was tense .
by the way , whos ' idea was it to have flanagan marking lukaku for that 3rd everton goal ? he'll never win that header
good game ... welldone liverpool & everton . 
everton 3 - 3 * liverpool ( daniel sturridge 89 ' )
amazing merseyside derby .
what a game , that's why the merseyside derby is the best in the country , fair result 
sorry yeah everton
also knowing some fans it's probably allen's fault everton scored the 3 goals .
what a game !! 
liverpool are shit üòë
three facts that changed the game . mirallas didn't get a red card . joe allen didn't score . mignolet saved our ass 
this year arsenal and liverpool fancy it i'm telling ya
everton nice game
football is much more fun when the merseyside derby is relevant . game of the season so far .
damnnn liverpool-3 everton-3
liverpool vs evertown , wow whatta game

what a fantastic game .. would have loved a liverpool win but i'm not mad at the tie ,, everton played so well !
everton is dog shit , why dem even a score pon we kmt .
i will give liverpool ¬£100 out of my own pocket to get rid of joe allen !!
i've just seen this line on bbc website - ' has there ever been a more entertaining merseyside derby ?' i suppose 1991 is ancient history now .

thank you everton and liverpool .... great opening game to the weekend , hopefully there are lots more goals this afternoon 
fuck you haters . now how you like liverpool ?! i'll just wait for the manchester derby . then we'll see who comes out on top .
i wanted to laugh at liverpool for screwing up a lead but i am afraid that karma will strike back at chelsea later :' d

the ¬£15m man , joe allen comes back , misses a sitter and costs liverpool the game <3 
everton were savages man they need to all go and sit in the corner lpool were too polite the fkin monkeys we could have won that easy
so many errors , good goals and fouls in that game . typical merseyside derby that
everton : putting supporters through torture since 1878
liverpool grabbed the 1 point and is still behind arsenal by 1 point .

damn it !! so close . have to settle for a draw . oh well , at least we didn't loose i suppose . great game . 
that merseyside derby was top viewing ‚öΩüëèüëè
liverpool always draw after international break
 3 3 . fair result in yet another mad merseyside derby . both teams had the chances to win it + made the mistakes to lose
absolutely unbelievable . i think everton deserved the points personally , but you cannot knock the red men's heart . 3 goals from set pieces .
considering liverpool won the first half and everton the second , i'd say that was a fair result , but both teams could have won it outright .
one of the best merseyside derbys in years , imo it's the best derby in england ..
where would liverpool be without mignolet ? he is one of , if not the most important player for liverpool .
everton vs liverpool probably the best match for today ! the other matches are bot going to be as exciting . exceptional match !
everton should have killed it tho ugh !
what a game .. maximum ! everton 3 liverpool 3 ...

not buying into that being the best derby in years , 3 scrappy goals , liverpool shite , everton not much better !
everton had so many chances which should've been finished ... barkley in my opinion !!

liverpool really should have won joe allen you're a prick - , - good game tho hahahha got mother interested in the end
tbh everton should've beaten us , mirallas was meant to be sent off though
everton pays extra money 2 barca 4 each match delofou or wotever does not play ... xo i dnt blame dem 4 puttin im !

a breathless merseyside derby between everton and liverpool ended in a 3-3 draw as sturridge scored a late equaliser in 89th minute .
desperately wanted liverpool to lose ... : 3
what a game ! what a game ! what a game ! the merseyside derby did not disappoint ! 
lukaku doing his job well at everton . stole 2 points of liverpool . could have been all 3 had moses not won the free kick for the 3rd goal .
that everton - liverpool game was good
everton 3 vs 3 liverpool
the merseyside derby did not disappoint , what a game
great entertainment from merseyside derby , really good match ..
sloppy second half , glad to get out of everton with a draw there .
game of the season so far ! ynwa ! 
everton should have been down to ten men
but defense has to get organized , especially on set pieces . wtf was johnson doing for everton's 3rd ? why would he mark lukaku ?
 the merseyside derby has lived up to its billing . good game .
now this is what we call a derby . 
everton v them .... excellent game - hugely impressed with everton . my only complaint is liverpool's 3 goals !! 
ft : everton 3-3 liverpool . brilliant derby ! thank you lukaku ! good result for us :d
why did i miss the merseyside derby ...
an epic merseyside derby sees honours even at goodison park . most intense we've seen in years . 
if it wasn't for joe allen's horrible miss , liverpool would've won comfortably .
everton 3-3 liverpool ... good result for us 
probably the best second half of the season ! still , why play flanagan ? 
good job everton .
big chance for today , liverpool dropping points and beating will extend our lead at the top to 5 .

wow ! really can't wait to watch the highlights for everton vs liverpool !
congrats liverpool :d
everton v liverpool - best prem game i've seen in years .
all over at the goodison park ! everton 3-3 liverpool 
mirallas shouldn't have been anywhere near that pitch to set up everton's 2nd and 3rd .
when liverpool lose suarez lol
liverpool very lucky to get a draw , everton with 100 chance wasted but what an absolute beautiful exciting derby üëçüòçüëè
great match ! derby of merseyside .. blood still red .. 
partidazo en el derby de merseyside . everton 3-3 liverpool . .
liverpool again dreadful 2nd half . mirallas should've been sent off and allen the fucking idiot missed a complete sitter
everton was cheering and cheering till the 89min . then silent le .
full time everton - liverpool 3-3 . enormous show of the two teams 
lucky to get point in the end wouldn't deserved to loose 
end to end stuff from merseyside , lovely game for a neutral
ft : liverpool 3-3 everton . nice coutinho , suarez , sturridge . 
liverpool dont half rely on set pieces
looking at the scorers in liverpool v everton you would think chelsea was playing haha
undoubtedly the best merseyside derby i have ever watched
maybe fair result in the end but has to be said best derby i've seen good game everton .
wtf is going on with everton goalie's beard 
what a brilliant match ! shame liverpool didn't get the win they deserved . no idea why kevin mirallas wasn't sent off . phi dowd bottled it .
2 cs have always killed liverpool's chances complacency and consistency
i assume all the liverpool fans want rodgers out after them blowing a lead into a 3-3 draw away from home ... or it just our lot that do that ?
liverpool 3 : everton 3 seri . done . let it be this way .
best merseyside derby i've ever seen !! both teams could have won , allen miss could have buried the game 
wow ! so my bro supports liverpool . they were losing 3-2 to everton changes to arsenal , sturridge equalizes , back to liverpool .
being in liverpool for a merseyside derby has made me realise just how many inbred liverpool fars there are
what an amusing match , one of the best matches liverpool played so far !
man everton vs liverpool was such a nerve wrecking game ! 
liverpool !
gonna go out on a limb and say the merseyside derby was a hair better than the yorkshire one .
everton vs liverpool , what a game ...
everton doesn't play that bad
great match liverpool and everton . next , is 
 barclays premier league - result : everton 3 - 3 liverpool arguably the game of the season ends all square at .
that liverpool game was insane
get as cocky as you like , liverpool , still not as good as us .
why everton like so many fast players
best merseyside derby in years , either team could have won , feel physically drained after that
thank you liverpool ... ynwa !!!
even if liverpool had lost the game , i'd not be disappointed .
great game , fair result ... joe allen cost liverpool 3 points today . harsh but true . 
 could have won , could have lost . everton decent team ( better than under moyes ? ) , so it's a decent away point , i feel .
a draw in the merseyside derby not a bad result for us at all . suits me just fine .
if joe allen would have put that sitter away it would have been game over for everton , fuck off allen .
liverpool <3
what a game . mirallas should of been off tho . and i never want to see lukaku against liverpool again . still a fantastic game .
thank you liverpool and everton ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô
everton's 3-3 draw with liverpool still leaves on ! 
ft : everton three liverpool three .
glad that's over , my heart can't take the stress of derby games - 3 all is a fair result i guess .... 
 everton 3 - 3 liverpool finalizado
watched it in a bar full of liverpool/everton fans . best thing ever . mental celebrations . i spent most of the game laughing .
if you didn't watch the darby between liverpool and everton , you missed out 
merseyside derby was a scorcher , gerard's delivery was top notch , lukaku was a force 
everton - liverpool ... quel match !!! üëèüá¨üáß 
everton 3 liverpool 3 ft . i'm just now catching my breath . that midfield needs work yoh !
great game , poor defending and finishing do for . much better side , couldn't finish properly . 
final whistle on a fantastic merseyside derby . thought everton were gonna do it but hey ho ! maybe next time . brilliant match .
says : merseyside derby , good game . obviously , mignolet is a great keeper and lukkaku is a beast .
men always on liverpool case yc
i'll take a draw away at everton but we should've won , allen played well but that miss was beyond a joke , man
in fairness though everton v liverpool was a brilliant match though
liverpool > brazil
remember after the palace game everyone thought liverpool would smash us ? be happy with that draw
everton should have won
should have got the win there , but fell apart at the end defensively . overall though really good game to live up to the history ! 
liverpool should have win . allen should score
best match this season . had everything : goals ; feisty tackles , fast paced . 3-3 fair result . 
another vital point for liverpool to stay away from the relegation battle !
brilliant game ... though liverpool should have won it .. mirallas should have seen a straight red .. 
and yeah , seems like tonight merseyside blue and red are shared together , share 1 point . kahkah
yes , the correct answer is five . five of the six goals scored in the merseyside derby today came from set plays defended by man-marking .
everton unlucky not to get all 3 points there , totally outplayed loserpool
liverpool dropped 2pts .... arsenal is next !
disappointed of result but i think is fair for everton 3 and our team 3 , and we had 1 point 
ft , liverpool vs everton : 3-3 . pretty much match of the season ! so much tension , pressure & nerves ! great game !
great mersyside derby . everton were the better team and the missed chances cost them 2 points 
should have won today allen should have scored today how much have everton paid the ref today dowd was poor
still gotta say well played everton luky to get point
the match between liverpool and everton had to be one of the best and most exciting match i've ever seen
what a game though . that was the best merseyside derby i've ever watched . point gained in my opinion , onwards and upwards ! 
everton could have won haiiish
neither of us deserved to lose imo , so hats off for producing such an enthralling derby , merseyside united .
side note : everton 3-3 liverpool . that was a match .
those everton fans celebrating that lukaku goal like a title must be gutted . 
liverpool so overrated . 78 minutes before they created a chance from open play ... feels like a defeat that . 
i always wonder if liverpool fans feel conflicted trying to hate everton . they're just objectively a much nicer club .
what an incredible match ! this is why i love the premier league ! 3 - 3
everton/liverpool both drop points . chance to go 4 points clear at the top . 15 minute kick-off delay btw . 
so its a life supporting tranmere for baby jack winsor after yet another merseyside derby draw 
good game liverpool not sure it was worth my whole drink over me though 
great merseyside derby ! fairplay to both sides for playing attacking football . 3-3
any liverpool fan saying they deserved it are chatting shit it was an even could of went both ways
great comeback from liverpool to make it draw 
liverpool is gonna give me a heart attack one of these day god damn ! lol what a derby . 3-3 vs everton 
i swear to god , i just woke up , and i dreamed that liverpool and everton ended 3-3 , also saints 7-2 arsenal , that's the reason why i'm up .
yes everton ! you smacked it !!!!! come on the arsenal boys ! 3 points ! today !!!
liverpool , you had one job to do and you've failed . my weekend accumulator is ruined after the 1st game üòí
what a crazy game ! everton 3-3 liverpool .

full time [ derby merseyside ]: everton 2-2 liverpool 
great game everton vs fools . can't wait for tomorrow's game vs cardiff . let's keep this run going

i hate liverpool going back to bed
so one big gun has fallen , liverpool endeni home , go take porrigde and keep warm , the rain has just began beating you .
fuhh . cantik betul game everton . respect gilaa . through ball cun habis !!
calm down the play and take a breath , liverpool keep attacking so fast resulting in getting quickly dispossessed . everton just counter .
maaan . wish everton had won just for lukaku's sake . brilliant match !
 escaped at the end of it . feel everton should‚Äôve won it , were the better side .

liverpool fans happy with a point hahahahha
so happy we got an equaliser i fucking love liverpool football club‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
some serious questions should b asked regarding liverpool midifeld , especially in 2nd half . can't remember how manytimes everton broke through
that sturridge goal !! celebrated so much fucking hell thought we was gonna loose to everton
sturridge had to kill everton vibe
and tthat's why we love the merseyside derby 
3-3 what a game between everton and liverpool , sturridge saves the dayy !!

joe allen needs to hang up his boots , for liverpool's sake .

merseyside is red
everton haven't conceded in like 5hrs of game play and all of a sudden we could have had em 3-1 . our team is really good this season .
allen's miss was key , everton were given a second chance and made quite a lot of it . mirallas ' not being sent off of course important too .
liverpool aha stole a point everton deserved all three 
liverpool conceded 3 and if not for mignolet could have conceded 6 , is it time for toure and sakho at the centre ? 
ft : everton 3-3 liverpool .. very good game by both teams .!!!
cracking game ! everton not an easy place to go and get points . onwards we go . !

liverpool derby lived up to its expectations 
manchester needs to look at liverpool , much more exciting games and far superior atmospheres
what an intense merseyside derby
hearing the liverpool vs everton game was a lot
what a game ( for the neutral ! ) . liverpool can not deal with dead balls , every goal conceded was from a set piece . 
if every liverpool player didn't have at least 1 leg broken in that match then i say poor show everton !
would have loved a win but what a game liverpool sturridge thank you for the third goal !!! 3-3 !!! 
draw is a fair result ... neither liverpool or everton deserve to win
so 12 games in and we've already dealt with everton , united & newcastle . christ . 
decent enough merseyside derby .
* watching game at mcd * * random chinese uncle appears * " whats the score ?" " 2-3 liverpool losing ." " heart pain ah got 55$ on the line ." hahah
thats a proper derby that . would have took a point away tho . everton are a cracking team this season .

what a game , but a draw is good for liverpool more space for us the devils ... 
what a game !! everton vs . liverpool ! good tie !
the merseyside derby is the most exciting derby in the uk . the manchester derby and others are just there .
i'd be surprised if everton don't make the top 6 this season
merseyside derby lived up to the potential , its a shame joe allen hasn't . 
fair to say everton will be bringing a dvd of that one out .
yesssssss liverpool ( 3 ) - ( 3 ) everton yea baby at least liverpool didn't win :p now this is what i called a derby match :d
not a bad merseyside derby . and even better , the result which means we can and would go four points clear at the top today .
yknow manu fams should just shut the hell up . stop insulting liverpool or whatever . please see where manu stand now .

chelsea players giving the merseyside derby some real class

you can't be a rational person and a liverpool fan at the same time . you must shun your morality & rationalism to be a savage scouser thug .
gilaaaaaaaa ft : everton 3-3 liverpool
what a derby game . 3-3 well done evrton well done liverpool quality stuff . take not other derby games . that's how its done wat a spectacle
everton deserved to win btw . lukaku is one dangerous man . and couldn't find suarez anywhere but when he fell , he is a shite . 
great game , such a pity everton were so poor on set pieces , deserved to win .
great start to the weekend , hats off to both liverpool & everton . a draw a fair result , do love ds celebration ! follow that arsenal/saints !
everton cheated and cheated and cheated , should've been down to 10 , but a draw is probably fair
gutted ! no liverpool fan can say they should of won that ! absolutely hammered them ! just 1 stupid mistake takes 2 points off us !
ain't gonna lie the old liverpool defo would've lost at 3-2 rodgers has changed us ‚ù§Ô∏è

 .. teams always play like mad went they are against legendary .. ft : everton 3-3 liverpool .. steady on 
feels like i've been out for about 4 days . everton blew that .
thank god for sturridge .. everton should have been down to ten men 
everton will be happy with that .
mourinho must of had a line of coke when he agreed to loan lukaku to everton
outstanding performance by everton . they should have won the merseyside derby . 
liverpool vs . everton it was a war more than a football match
a draw -_- everton 3 liverpool 3 .

that deulofeu kid is astonishing , he changed the game completely for everton
i understand why kenny resigned after a 4-4 draw against everton . i mean , 3-3 had me crazy and i'm not even a liverpool manager .
this was a pretty a pretty memorable merseyside derby

liverpool dropping points üëèüëè we need a win today
disgusting there by webb , oh it was dowd . allen a waste of a liverpool shirt and mirallas a petty thug ( draws blood twice) . 
too many advantages that phil dowd gave to everton . mirallas should got a red card . and the game will change after that .
another classic messy side derby . what a game of football between liverpool and everton !!! both teams deserve to share the points .
didn't watch the game like but the everton vs liverpool game sounded class . i wil try and watch the highlights later .
everton fans are hilarious
everton 3-3 liverpool -_- not impressed

seems like regardless of the system used liverpool never look completely comfortable defending the flanks .
everton v liverpool poor defending , great game

liverpool fc is really challenging for this silverware .
that guy in no 10 shirt for everton is so full of shit !

thank you , everton :) can't wait for southampton's help hihi
just won 50 squid on liverpool/everton 3-3 get on there !!!
everton 3 liverpool 3 . one of the best derby match yet
just in : liverpool proposes to sell joe allen to anyone for ¬£10m . liverpools treat .
sigh . liverpool had this won . everton should have had a man sent off & allen's horrendous miss . but that's how derbies go . fun game .
if everton didn't look like cheap chinese beer peddling smurf gypsies i might have said the can play some football ! great game 
can't believe liverpool just equalised at the last minute ! united need a win tomorrow . 
joe allen , pls go fuck yourself ! liverpool could have won bitch !
that is why liverpool will never win a premier league !! not clinical and don't have the balls for it .. 
full time : everton 3-3 liverpool . this is what i call derby ."

liverpool grabbed the lead , we stole it back , but liverpool nicked an equaliser . typical scousers . 
tomorrow cardiff's fans= liverpool fans
that liverpool/everton game was awesome ... a lot of action . now bring on the 
rival watch : everton drew with liverpool in a exciting match . draw is good for us .
both everton and liverpool need to learn how to defend set-pieces ... 
my dad comes in after the game " i'm a redsox fan , the redsox own a piece of liverpool , therefor i'm a liverpool fan " me : get . out . now ......
good game . the merseyside derby is always exciting .
liverpool football club ynwa !!!
have no more words to say about this epic game well played everton
que partidazo en goodison park ... gran liverpool 
one of the best game , havent seen everton been so strong before
everton 3-3 liverpool ? not bad
i think final score of merseyside derby is ideal for everton fc or liverpool fc
ml : so who's the better team on merseyside ? guess we'll have to wait for the return fixture at anfield to find out .
sounds like a bore draw in the merseyside derby
what a great derby of . fantastic performance by both teams 
liverpool need to work on their defence .
now that was a merseyside derby ! lukaku vs suarezüëå

liverpool vs everton .... one of the best games i have seen in a while ! 
liverpool derby sounded mental
draw , but pretty clear liverpool are not the best team on merseyside .
merseyside derby done . next ! london derby .
thank you derby merseyside selaluseru !
that's probably up there as one of the best merseyside derbies to be played .
this why i love premiere league . every team have a chance to win it . no matter they small , mid-table or bigger club . c'mon everton !
would have loved a win but a draw thats decent tbh , plus this everton teams decent this season
following the updates for that merseyside derby was some emotional rollercoaster !
oh everton ..
goodgame liverpool !! 
merseyside derby 1 poin huhhft
 vs ... what a half !
fuckin cant stand the blue nose twats yerno ye best player isnt even a everton player still a chelsea man so go an shag ye nan
allen isn't a liverpool player ! he done nothing but make it hard for us to win . meant to be good with the ball yet he never looks good on it
it's still a mystery how chelsea & man u can score 6 ' into injury time and everton & liverpool get whistled at 4 ' after scoring 6 
that was a proper old school merseyside derby . controversy , passion & most of all goals ! 
liverpool got lucky there ...
cracking merseyside derby . lets hope they haven't used up all the juju for the rest of today's games .
but too bad manchester derby manchester united isn't up to the standard to liverpool fightback . 
 ft => everton 3 -- 3 liverpool 
draw was 11/5 in merseyside , should've been backed 
what a merseyside derby ! must admit a draw was a fair result in the end , but a cracking game .
feels like three points for liverpool that . reckon a certain ¬£17m centre half will have little trouble getting in from now on though .
wow , everton 3 - 3 liverpool :o
great game that , would take a draw maybe should have won , allen was good but for the miss , everton should have been down to 10 . 
liverpool should of won that . joe allen should of scored : |
time to thank everton üíÉüíÉüëå well done !! effin entertaining match
great point away to . 3-3 what a great mersey side derby . & we're brilliant . work to be done . 
everton-liverpool what a match that was !! wow 
liverpool won't make top 3 with a defense like that . everton cut them up all game , luckily for liverpool mignolet bailed them out a lot
given that everton really should have been down to 10 men , i think a draw was the right result . 
that was joe allans last game for liverpool
thats great result at godisonpark , its derby merseyside 
liverpool is the best 
everton had clear chances but joe allen should of scored or passed it to suarez , welsh cunt
one word for merseyside derby today .. awesome .. 
the way i hate liverpool
everton you drive me nuts . shoulda won that one
this . is liverpool .
in a derby at goodison in which everton should have been down a man and liverpool scored three goals , the point is not bad
it was not merseyside derby but merciless derby 
great stuff . applause for the everton boys , fought hard , deserve all the plaudits . lukaku looked sharp just as i predicted he scored .
arsenal , liverpool , chelsea , barcelona , real madrid , bayern munchen , dortmund .
ft : everton 3-3 liverpool goodisan park 
merseyside derby was definitely worth getting up at 6:30 for ... distin's unbelievably stupid foul ruined everton's chance to go 2nd

i hope he never plays for liverpool again i hate him .
what an amazing derby ! everton played wicked
liverpool üíô
hard race today at liverpool ! impressive efforts from everyone :) 
ft : everton 3-3 liverfool what a game that was r . lukaku scored 2 goals for everton ! :-d 
a draw is the very least we deserved out of that one , the ref was useless and joe allen should never pull on a liverpool shirt again .
merseyside is red ! everton win this night ? owh no no no just for several minutes .

two teams from liverpool and neither could nick a win . who'd have thought it ?

everton fans are bare inbred tho ! finally been to a merseyside derby and most probably the best one in years !! money well spent !
what a merseyside derby 3-3 !
great game ! everton edged it . mignolet was fantastic . but at the end of the day i fully blame joe allen for the fact we didn't get 3pts !
ft liverpool vs everton 3-3
that's why the merseyside derby is the best
best merseyside derby of all time .

that's the best derby for years , what derby's are all about ! for me everton the better team an should have had all 3 points ! superb game tho
someone should show pardew a video of that merseyside derby to illustrate that it is , in fact , ok for both sides to show up in a derby match

milan derby ? catalan derby ? madrid derby ? no , thanks . i'll head to merseyside for my derbies . 
ft everton 3 vs liverpool 3 
what a match -- it had everything except a winning goal ! another great merseyside derby !
southampton beat liverpool & who else ? hull ? fulham ? crystal palace at home ? ohh pleasee
liverpool should have took the 3 points and killed the game off earlier .
liverpool got such a lucky escape !
lets hope barwell v trafford is as entertaining as the everton game .
i don't like everton !
we out sang , out played , out classed liverpool . if it wasn't for mignolet the better team would have won 
joe allen was terrible ! know will you joe allen groupies stfu ! lucas , migonolet & suarez our best players . everton 3-3 liverpool
damn liverpool got lucky
great merseyside derby , right up there with the very best . mirallas should've seen red though & how allen missed that chance i'll never know
it seems like that merseyside derby was a bit of a stinker doesn't it ? as for me , i'm at league 2's top side oxford for morecambe's visit
that was a crazy match between everton and liverpool 
ft : everton 3-3 liverpool . what a game .
œà—íaÃÖÃ≤Ã∂Ã•Ãä≈ß a match , merseyside derby was on point ...
liverpool buy good players just to bench them . pure bullshit
what are everton without lukaku ? relegated
even though he scored , bringing sturridge on for lucas was rodgers ' big regret , left defence far too vulnerable with everton still on top .
sturridge rescued liverpool's ass tho ...
bpl results everton 3-3 liverpool . great match ! 
what a game of football . liverpool v everton 3-3

full time everton 3-3 liverpool
stuck on the train following the merseyside derby on twitter was simply devastating
everton 3 , liverpool 3 . in one of the best game's of the season , five of six goals come from set pieces in the merseyside derby . 
when my father started dancing when liverpool got the equaliser though hahahah
a dissapointing gerrard , an efficient lukaku , a majestic mignolet , polemics , passion , goals : a terrific and thrilling derby 
liverpool tied everton ! after a bad half for everton with 2-1 they came back and scored 2 with lukaku . then sturidge scored and made it 3-3 .
fuck how both everton's 2nd half goals came after taking two key midfielders off poor subs but then again danny got the all important3rdgoal
great attacking football from everton but they defended like wigan !
final : everton 3-3 liverpool .
final result : everton 3- liverpool 3
entertaining , pulsating , intriguing and suspense filled merseyside derby ..... the best i've seen for so many years ....

this is ture story sturridge can score for liverpool but not for england lol
i feel so sick . things are changing under martinez . liverpool are still shite ! 
crazy merseyside derby .
in his first season with everton , roberto martinez did what david moyes was not able to do for years .. everton is üëç
everton vs liverpool : ÔêÇ—í√£‚Ä†‚Äã an astonishing come back f‚ò∫—èÃ©Ã•Ãä the two teams . hala #
what a game that was ! liverpool missed another opportunity to go top for a few hours at least
miralles should of been sent off and allen missed the goal from the 6 liverpool deserved to win
all i can thing is that i wish david moyes would still be at everton . no way toffees would play like they did today with him on touchline .
evertons number 17 loves a goal against liverpool
what a match . everton 3-3 liverpool ! can't wait for motd :)
everton are by farr a better team than ever .. kudos to roberto martinez , d big teams nid to be careful as everton wil def av a say come may
no-one can understand the atmosphere in liverpool right now , the city is on another level of excited what a game
ai caramba ( bart's voice) . grande play ! ft everton 3-3 liv'pool . acho que nem o drtmbnd x byrn vai ser emocionante como este derby . 
i'd rather walk alone ! kopites are gobshites ! should have been 3-2 everton . shite got lucky .
what a match ! the best mersyside derby ive ever seen 
match of the season by far . best merseyside derby ever 
just seen the merseyside derby result . what an exciting match it seems i missed üò¢
liverpool will never change fuckers always get away with it 
lucky everton twats , mirallas should of been sent off the fucking nonce
who gives one about the merseyside derby ? all about england rl
sloppy defending by liverpool caused that draw !!
in summary : miralles ( non ) red card the difference . liverpool are magic , everton tragic .
what a very tough game liverpool !
merseyside derby's stress me out 
everton will take points from the other big teams but frustrating that game should have been wrapped up . midfield looked weak and set pieces
by 2moro man united will jus be 2 points behind some merseyside team . heheheh tikubwela
ah liverpool ‚ô• 3-3
all i'm saying is last year we had a clear goal ruled offside and this year everton should have had 2 players sent off . rant over .
everton 3 - 3 liverpool
backed liverpool and coventry on two seperate bets hahah well done greg
 full-time 3-3 
what a game ! liverpool-everton ! love bpl !
mignolet kept liverpool in the match outstanding performance by him
unlucky liverpool , should have won it
fucking hell , i'm going to a&e , heart is coming out my chest ... what a game !!! prob fair result on balance 
liverpool serilah . srys no lie .
( 3-3 ) both sides of merseyside should be happy with their lot ..
whew this was definitely the most intense and the best merseyside derby i've seen 
wonder if there's diving boards at the liverpool training ground :' d 
what a game ! disappointed the liverpool fc drew ... but not to bad considering we had to come back in the 89th minute 
if allen put that sitter of a chance away it could of been different . but everton also had chances , so in the end , a fair result !
 you don‚Äôtdeserve to wear the liverpool jersey . you cost us the game . 
evento 3-3 liverpool
det er ikk som at se andre derbys ... this is the battle of merseyside !!!
should have kept pepe reina , liverpool . you dicks .
that merseyside derby was an amazing game ..
great merseyside derby !! finished 3-3 , i prefer won though .
i'd rather liverpool buy sergi roberto from barcelona and play him , rather than joe allen flop every single game he's playing . seriously .
well played everton . if we had all the money that they had and could afford wages we'd beat them every single time . 
if you aren't sold on " soccer ", i suggest you find highlights of everton v liverpool . now .
every liverpool player thinking joe allen is shit for missing that chance i bet loooool
motm for liverpool . mignolet . flanagan too was brilliant ! should be starting next game .
what a merseyside derby ! 3-3 , could and should have been at least 2 more goals .
more of it liverpool . the only team that will compete with for the title is man utd . you can kee yourself .
liverpool have ruined my acca ! thanks suarez
undoubtebly the best merseyside derby i have seen in years ... congrats to everton for an excellent challenge . 
atleast we can get a draw away to everton with not a full strength team üëè . fix it rodgers . 3 defensive midfielders is a joke 
that was trully derby ...!!!! insane game ... everton-liverpool
2 points dropped by liverpool .. widening the gap ! 
jesus , my heart was in my mouth ! that's a derby ! everton played well , but liverpool should have won it ... allen missed a sitter ! 
liverpool have still not ' won ' a second half this season , have they ?
ima need life insurance to watch the next liverpool vs everton game my heart was doing overtime . what a game 3-3 is a fair result
everton 3-3 liverpool . great game . everton unlucky not to win it . mignolet was immense and saved us from a loss . still 2nd . 
mignolet and flannagan both outstanding today in a 3-3 . everton a really good team again this season 
what a game ! we done well to get a draw in the end 
all the mancs on my timeline loving everton ... even tho they will finnish above them in the league 
well there is no competition winners today . everton v liverpool had it all but just no red cards . if we get 10 rt here we will have another
how did the everton v liverpool derby go ?
final score everton 3-3 liverpool ; great fought in a merseyside derby 
c'mon liverpool !!
best merseyside derby ever ? 
disappointed with the result but that was some epic entertainment . i don't think joe allen should ever start again for liverpool .
just when all those dvd companies were getting excited for the day everton beat liverpool . they'll have to cancel the order for another year
heart was in my mouth that hole game !! massive point against a serious everton side !!
fulltime ; liverpool 3-3 everton 
if allen scored that liverpool would of won that easy , what a cunt
yes liverpool tied 
that's the most nervous i've felt at a match , being in the everton end for them is ruthless mate , best feeling ever when sturridge scored !!!
well i'd take a boring 1-0 to the arsenal after that manic everton v liverpool game !
great game , would've been better if everton won ... but now arsenal must win 
 that was a proper derby .
one of the best merseyside derbies i've seen ! thought i was gonna see another ' gary mcallister ' winner for 
underate everton at your own peril .
mignolet is motm for me . he saved liverpool's ass a lot . great game .
lol :d liverpool is loosing
amazing game though . merseyside derbies are one of a kind üëå
southampton wins , liverpool top of the table .
what a merseyside derby ! seru !
what a terrific merseyside derby !
everton 3 liverpool 3 draw was a fair result ..
well thanks to this guy .. daniel sturridge !! we managed to square merseyside derby !!
wow the derby was awesome ! great soccer
glad to see chelsea was represented well in the merseyside derby .
everton the better team today . fortunate to get a point . weak weak defense . started with the wrong team .
wow everton havnt lost at home in the whole of 2013 calender year in the league
nice game liverpool and everton üëç
missed the liverpool game but lowe it lets see what southampton are sayin

full time : everton 3 - 3 liverpool . not bad lah :)
ft : everton ( 3 ) vs ( 3 ) liverpool . 
nothing like a merseyside derby to make you feel highly tense and mildly nauseous on a saturday afternoon . 
 liverpool fan talking about welsh xavi
89mins : everton 3-3 liverpool . daniel sturridge glances steven gerrard's free kick into the far corner . sas can't stop scoring
great game at goodison park in the merseyside derby . a belter in fact . 3-3 . but this 2013 match at wembley is a classic .
a combination of joe allen and ref . dowd cost us 2 points . disappointed but exited for everton to go to anfield .
merseyside derby at it's best .. lukaku what a player .... time for arsenal vs saints 
all and all , we can easily say that lukaku deserves to be wearing our everton crest and staying at goodison park . sign him up roberto !
ft everton 3 - liverpool 3 . damn you lukaku and fools you allen !
suarez no 1 , liverpool dan sturridge no 2 
as for everton : learn how to tackle and sell kevin mirallas , the definition of a scumbag .
a loanee is wearing the no 10 t shirt for everton !! huh .
well thats about it . ft everton 3-3 liverpool .
merseyside derby 3-3 üëç good result for us . need to get something tomorrow to capitalise ! 
merseyside derby is the best derby in d world !!
stayed up till 4 playing fifa , manager mode as liverpool . i bought gundogan for 15mill plus allen . allen proved my logic today ! fvck you !!!
an incredible merseyside derby !!!!
rather troubling for to concede 3 goals from set-pieces in one game . 
liverpool have sturridge , everton have lukaku and chelsea have torres and eto'o 
would have been 3-1 to liverpool without he chelsea player !!
once again ! everton is a team to beat ...
atleast i can go ahead everton tomorrow
lukaku scores 2 against liverpool ! what a beast
this kid has had a great game in the midfield . surprise package was liverpool's left wing back . 
how did we not win that . totally outplayed the red shite . so proud of the team with the courage we showed though . love you everton .
belgien - fc liverpool 3:3

ft .... neverton 3-3 liverpool .... sturridge the saviour of liverpool ..... amazing game .... not a good result but a good performance ...!!!
everton is the perfect club for lukaku ! ! his stats per game is massive at the moment !
liverpool seri ? why ? they should lose . haha
sturridge . give him a liverpool shirt and he scores . england shirt and he doesn't touch the ball .
so liverpool refused to top league for some hours ¬†
yeah .. thats it . merseyside derby . so many drama . 
let's be honest . most of us wanted everton to bag that . everybody loves to see the red shite get beat !
for me , lukaku , barkley and no . 10 from everton were really good but still screw them for not getting us to top of table ..
what a fucking game !! best merseyside derby i've ever seen and defo the game of the season üôåüôåüôå
i got the everton first goal part of the preview wrong but the result was correct .
liverpool-everton 3-3 draw . what an amazing game .
joe allen loathed by liverpool loved by everton
we were disgusting today but remember everton needed awful refereeing , awful performances and an an awful miss to scrape a draw at home
best merseyside derby in years , it had it all apart from a red card , although there should of been one 
what a match ! superb performance from flanagan & mignolet . really pissed off with allen though . merseyside derby at it's best 
great merseyside derby full of passion and super sturridge strikes again ! 
stress the way jake supports everton yeno
the ref was a fucking everton fan
decent appetiser that . draw a good result as i'm struggling to pick who i hate more . prefer the everton team but both set of fans are scum
what a merseyside derby that was !!! two good footballing managers letting their teams play ! 
merseyside derby , best derby game i've ever watched this season , what a game
merseyside derby did not disappoint . although not pleased lukaku scored two just as i remove him from my fantasy team 
sharing points with everton are sucks .
i've watched more of the rugby league than i did the merseyside derby , fantastic game of rugby league ! so much better than union
it's always good to beat everton but i'll take a draw after that , midfield disappointing thank god for sturridge and suarez ! 
wooooow , what a derby ! liverpool 3:3 everton ! great game . now southampton better stop arsenal en we move on ...... 2013 /14 .
best match mon gete dan tou la league sa saison la rest liverpool everton :) rien a dir top match man of the match 4 mi mignolet : *
what a crazy game . one of the most dramatic merseyside derbies ' i've ever seen .
idgaf win lose or draw i love liverpool !!!! ‚ô•
everton should have won the game with the 2nd half chances . mignolet kept liverpool in it . great derby game . fair result in the end 
what ' a game everton 3- 3 liverpool
good job liverpool . i'll take a draw over a loss to everton any day of the week . 
what a game that was ! would love the real scousers everton to have nicked it at the end though

wake up fi see seh liverpool draw star .... but sound like it was a good match
congrats liverpool seri yes
too many missed chances for everton ! could have easily scored more
really nice game liverpool vs everton . eventhough lukaku smashed last minute .
no derby is as good as merseyside derby .
for me , merseyside remains red !
i hope everton fans realise that next season they're going to have problems up front , west brom is currently feeling the lukaku effect .
merseyside derby . one of the best ever , dominated by the belgians 
its the merseyside derby na ... its always hot !!
liverpool match later come on you reds ! ! go top if we win !
suarez is just too good to be playing for liverpool
