seeing as spurs can seemingly only score from the spot i actually rate newcastle to take some off of them . naturally i'll be proven wrong .
newcastle have chosen the yellow strip purposely , and quite cleverly actually
said to my dad even before kickoff that newcastle were going to won 2-1 . seeing friedel's name on the teamsheet made me absolutely certain .
goal .... newcastle !!!!
latest scores in england , spain and italy tottenham 0-1 newcastle espanyol 1-3 sevilla genoa 2-0 hellas verona
gooooaaal . remy . spurs 0-1 newcastle . -az .
spurs 6/5 newcastle 19/10 draw 5/2 - newcastle currently lead 1-0 thanks to loic remy .
wonderful play by newcastle~
my lil bro screaming ' omg ' downstairs guessing newcastle scored .
i get up , make a coffee , switch on telly and the very instant the picture appears , there's a ball in tottenham net . great start to a sunday
what makes it more interesting is that newcastle are in a 4-4-2 shape against 4-3-3 . but they have played the wings very well .
friends of newcastle !!!
as much as i hate newcastle , remy is a player
newcastle are putting some good stuff together
don't concede a penalty if you don't want tottenham to score .
come on newcastle !
come on newcastle !
spurs loseing to newcastle at home !
if newcastle don't sign remy i have lost all faith ! 
great finish remy . 1-0 newcastle . let's hope newcastle continue to push on . i think they have taken confidence from last weeks win over cfc
would love a newcastle win , a sunderland win and a draw between utd and arsenal !
if newcastle take points off spurs , and united & arsenal draw , it's been a pretty good weekend for us .
tottenham are so boring
tottenham down already
newcastle ahead at spurs , chelsea and everton dropped points , united , arsenal or both to do so later . good weekend for a liverpool fan !
it's been coming at white hart lane . newcastle now 6/4 after remy's opener . draw 13/5 , spurs also 6/4 . bet in-play now ! live on ss 1.15 mins gone ..
newcastle playing some great stuff . tottenham poor opening 15mins

why are newcastle dressed like brazil ?! 
tottenham were under pressure at the back . newcastle turned them over , and made them pay . perfect ball in to remy and he made no mistake .
newcastle are finding gaps in the spurs defence so easy .
guessing newcastle just scored due to my sister's boyfriend's screaming
that was comical ! why do we look so nervous against newcastle ? come on get this back spurs !!
newcastle are basically french national team reserves + cabaye and remy
fair play newcastle !
newcastle are so bad !
lose to sunderland , win 2-0 to chelsea , winning 1-0 to spurs right .. 
i did say newcastle may cause an upset , tottenham have been poor this season .
fucking hell , nice one newcastle !
haha . who's idea was it for newcastle to play in the exact brazil colours ? possibly the most sarcastic thing i've ever seen . 
since when did newcastle play sexy football ??
potential to be 1-1 v newcastle though , not the same as at newcastle though .
tidy goal by newcastle , simple football no messing around .
newcastle will win the league
fuck you newcastle .
remy is showing his true ability now , newcastle look very dangerous ..
newcastle are playing some good football
newcastle have definitely started stronger
fuck yes remy you absolute god !!!!!! c'mon newcastle !!!!
hoping that tottenham and arsenal drop points today . would be a great weekend for liverpool if that happens ... 
newcastle are a strong team this season
yes newcastle !
now we'll see how good tottenham are .
awful defending by spurs . look really nervous . newcastle fully deserve being 1-0 up .
tothenham vs newcastle
yes newcastle , chin up to all you bellends with tottenham defenders in your fantasy football 
i knew tottenham would fuck up this bet ffs
newcastle appear to have their tactics spot on 15mins in .
started to watch last nights x factor , but looks like the spurs v newcastle match is alot more exciting
if firside win and arsenal do and tottenham lose it will be a good day
newcastle united should better win or get a draw against spurds
newcastle lead spurs 1-0 . there goes the first leg of the lucky 15 ! oh well ...

newcastle midfield r playing like beasts at the moment .. that's saying something against spurs
is it possible for spurs to score 2 goals to come back against newcastle ? i don't think so
goal spurs 0-1 newcastle ( 13 mins ) gouffran slips the ball through to loic remy , who takes it around friedel before slotting home
currently spurs 1 - 1 newcastle ( if you count spurs ' complementary bullshit penalty )
remy scores . tottenham 0-1 newcastle .
boom !! newcastle !! get in !!!
go on newcastle !
this spurs game is like a game of fifa newcastle are pressing the high pressure button on the d pad !
" why does the team need 3rd kit ?" hahahaha hina li jak . newcastle mok juak jersey banyak2 .
it isn't 1-1 at newcastle
newcastle always going to win this , spurs aren't dangerous what so ever
go ' ed newcastle
all newcastle have to do to win this game is not foul in the box . therefore if spurs don't get a pen they won't score
utd vs arsenal - draw , city & tottenham losing would be perfect results for me !
well deserved lead by newcastle .
newcastle's kit -_-
today , and today only ...... i'm a newcastle fan ......... haway , and all that shite !!
 : en juego . tottenham 0 - 1 newcastle .

newcastle are all over spurs like that drunk uncle that nobody likes to talk about .
i always saw danger in the remy kid from newcastle
tottenham fans must be wondering why , season upon season , they were linked to remy but passed up the chance to sign him . anyone who saw him .
newcastle lucky to have remy
wuhuuu newcastle take the lead again tottenham
goal !! loic remy 5pur2 0-1 newcastle

dembele's over-confidence on the ball gives newcastle the lead through remy

great start for newcastle . remy is class .
newcastle raping spurs . lol
newcastle 1-0 up already . is right you geordie farts .
newcastle bossing us in midfield 
did newcastle pay a fee and get remy for the season , because well erm , stating the obvious but ...
remy puts newcastle ahead . brilliant player . 1-0
cabye is way too good for newcastle 
we should have signed remy wait hes on loan at newcastle isn't he

no english player has scored for newcastle united in 2013 . shocking that .
there goes my double defensive clean sheet on fantasy football .. but i don't care , tottenham are losing !
newcastle are leading and they deserve to be . poor passage of play from friedel and we need sandro . so obvious . 
everton and newcastle are wearing the yellow kits this year as well .
will newcastle win again this time ?
goal @ white hart lane and newcastle are spoiling the party in north london remy takes it past the goalkeeper
if newcastle don't permanently sign remy i'm gunna be pissed off
no english player has scored for newcastle in 2013 ????
14 of newcastle's last 15 goals been scored by frenchmen .
alaamak spurs .. newcastle dah 1
aha newcastle get in !! remy just scored !
newcastle are not only looking like brazil today but actively imitating them 
remy would be well suited to play at the emirates , would be a good signing for wegner following his loan spell at newcastle .
tottenham have stared so badly
no talk sport commentator , paulinho won't mistake newcastle for brazil .
why do we always play so poorly against the shit sides , west ham and now newcastle
dire from tottenham this . beaten to everything so far .
howay newcastle .... 
still no english player score for newcastle this season .
newcastle are @ it again with their kind of game again .....
looks like tottenham have gone to the ' westwood sharks art of not being able to tackle school '.
newcastle are dominating
why is newcastle playing so beautiful ?
tottenham defence usually relied on lloris to rush out to get the ball . without him their back is too vulnerable .
newcastle looking very confident . passing has been superb
newcastle leading 
yeah come on newcastle !
newcastle's goal today was the first we've conceded to a non london side in the premier league . 
come on newcastle !!!
newcastle
yes !! yes ! loic remy 1 -0 tottenham ! come on newcastle united ! let's fuck tottenham

spurs been woeful can barley put 2/3 passes together could see newcastle gettin ' a few more here üî•
that goal was just pure pressure from newcastle
guess newcastle re unstoppeable at d moment
rosez arr red violetz arr blue ur losin tu newcastle ? dats y i left u
for a team that seems to be so heavily relying on 1 goal wins , tottenham's defence is a bit poor 
i don't know why i want newcastle to win today
this is going to be a battering for tottenham
did anyone else just see michael jackson in the newcastle fans ?
i don't want to tempt fate but ... newcastle united , it's just like watching brazil
cmon you barcodes !

how are newcastle doing well all of a sudden ?
i've got tottenham to win 2-1 think there will be more goals then that lol !
remy is so sick , want to see newcastle sign him for good , deserves better than qpr

this spurs and newcastle match is on very early
newcastle look really good . working twice as hard as spurs .
spurs 0 -1 newcastle . keep it up newcastle . beat that shit team .
get in the newcastle . finish spurs off . 
i think tottenham's biggest problem is that avb doesn't know his best team . that , and soldado is terrible .
tottenham ... seriously
spurs spent all that money and are losing at home to newcastle . 
come on newcastle !
newcastle look dangerous going forward

newcastle !! boom tottenham
14 of the 15 goals newcastle have scored this season , have been by frenchmen
newcastle already beating spurs
i don't rate tottenham at all , they're not serious title contenders
newcastle need to sign remy permanently !
the shit from tottenham hotspur went to rome to see the pope and this is what he said fuck off
newcastle wearing yellow and blue . they know !! ( plus interesting to see how puma would handle that color scheme ) 
gwarn newcastle ... but spurs are mucking up my acca already
wazi newcastle
spurs are playn shite .. mags r al owa em .. haway tottenham man ..
i think the commentators want tottenham to win
most top premiership teams have a decent , agile brazilian player , tottenham have paulinho ..
newcastle's away jersey is so similar to 's . this is surely the reason they are dominating the spurs . 
how does it feel to be tottenham , how does it feel to be small
if tottenham had a decent striker , they could be a great team
sense a pattern of newcastle's style will be crosses into friedel most the day !
newcastle lead through a loic remy goal
if remy is still playing for newcastle in january ill be shocked
newcastle 1 up . that wasn't meant to happen . potential accum buster !
if newcastle can get some good form and get remy , ben arfa and krul on good consistent form , they could be pushing euro league easily
tottenham v newcastle ko 12.00 on a sunday . where is the logic ??
come on newcastle
newcastle have scored 33 goals this year non by an englishman . remy . who is on loan from qpr . is french
tottenham getting beaten at home ..
yes newcastle !! #1 -0
come on newcastle 
goal . spurs 0-1 newcastle ( remy )
newcastle ... hmmmmm
 what a super good finish . 
i do like tottenham , but they don't get enough players in the box ? 1 man . 
no englishman has scored for newcastle in 2013 . out of their 15 goals this season , 14 has come from french players 
newcastle seem a different team this season . remy their only signing but it's working .
remy has been a top top signing for newcastle , quality finisher
should be two nil could be three . unlucky tottenham shit
commentator : " you can expect brad friedel to get a clean sheet today ". 20 seconds later tottenham 0-1 newcastle
golll ... l . remy . tottonham 0-1 newcastle
naaaaaa need tottenham to win
get in there newcastle ..!

newcastle , city and united will win today

cabaye is the best playmaker newcastle united had in the last decade . 
as if tottenham are still favourites to win the game and there losing !
can't believe we went and did newcastle at st james park 
newcastle fc the new brazil ! 
might have to watch the spurs game now , just in the hope that newcastle put another 3 or 4 past them .
came back from school with newcastle leading 1-0 ! keep it up ÓÄ¢ !
newcastle already ahead ...
how dies it feel to be tottenham how does it feel to be small
spurs are down 1-0 to newcastle how
really hope i don't regret not putting money on newcastle to beat spurs , swansea to beat stoke and man utd v arsenal draw . odds were 37/1

newcastle have some really classy players just need a few more hard men to strengthen their squad and they could push for top 4
newcastle fuck you
newcastle's away kit is so so bad

eriksen is the only signing that was worth it for tottenham . they're hilariously bad for the ¬£100 million they spent .
boom ! it's that son of a mourinho nightmare again loic remy !! tottenham 0 newcastle united 1 . 
newcastle's winning 
this idiot of a commentator thinks its debuchy playing as left-back for newcastle !! what an utter piece of shit

typical tottenham bottle jobs ! 
remy ishak gives newcastle a lead .
newcastle are 1-0 , last thing i want to be doing is going to work 
newcastle are having a pretty solid season so far .
alan smith needs to give up , paulinho runs into newcastle giving them the ball and he is blaming friedel ? 
come on newcastle !
i'm still not sold on paulinho or many other of the new tottenham signings . a lot of money spent on attacking players no return .... so far
you'd think we would be able to beat newcastle after we spent 100 million in the transfer window , i give up ..
arsene should drink remy martins in january ... then proceed to get remy from newcastle
that newcastle playin in arsenal away colours .
hahaha newcastle 1 nil up .

newcastle are helping us into fourth here . first chelsea and now spurs . well in .

oh look , newcastle winning tottenham at home .. remy again
if newcastle don't sign remy permanently it will be one of the stupidest things they could ever do 
this tottenham team tho :/
tottenham 0 vs 1newcastle .. wit yoan gouffran wit d assist n lioc remy finishn it up

so it seems spurs are being run ragged . just our luck we'd catch newcastle on one of their good days ...
 newcastle vs tottenham 
i like this newcastle away kit , very preston north end 07/08 .
remy is raping tottenham's defence üòÇ
newcastle are on job
i'm sorry but i actually despise newcastle me
boring boring tottenham hotspur 
tottenham can never handle the pressure 
defoe would score so many goals in this tottenham team ! 
remy is too good for newcastle
goal ! tottenham 0-1 newcastle ( remy , 13 min
newcastle look like the minions today !
i hate newcastle
if i was 15 and i had to support tottenham i would phone childline ! 
keep this newcastle
tottenham .... wetin dey happen ????
clearly newcastle set to mark townsend .
now watching spurs vs newcastle
newcastle got their tails up here
newcastle seem to think they are brazil 
we can not be losing to newcastle at home !! games like this is why we always end up outside of the cl .. common bullshit
want newcastle to beat spurs
remy gives newcastle a breathtaking lead in the 13th minute . spurs 0-1 newcastle
newcastle goal a perfect example of how friedel doesn't suit our style of play anymore totnew
knew newcastle were gunna score first
tottenham have nicely fucked my fantasy team over over by not playing llorisüëå
how quiet are the tottenham fans
i'm going to hate myself for saying this after last week , but newcastle better win .
tottenham fans were screaming because we spent ¬£100m that we'd finish top four . never understood the correlation between the two
i hate the fact that eriksen plays for tottenham , he's a problem you know
feel like staying in this train and just making a life for myself in newcastle
always said newcastle were a top top side
newcastle's away strip is smart . it's a shame i hate the twats .
as soon as i saw that friedel was in goal , i knew newcastle would have a great chance
newcastle scored !!!! if u know what i mean ;)
eriksen the best player for spurs so far . though newcastle have been better overall .
you'd miss seeing ba in a newcastle shirt he was way better at newcastle
but newcastle too dem charge ooo ! they are already leading spurs
newcastle
newcastle are working hard to uncover talent from the local area as they focus on the future , according to boss alan pardew .
this is brilliant stuff from newcastle at the moment . confidence is an amazing thing .
the reason tottenham conceded that goal is definitely because they don't have lloris . makes the high line work
cause when townsend has the ball pure newcastle players surround the man
what a poor start by tottenham . footy bet isnt looking good nw
power newcastle winning !
spurs should move for remy when he goes back to qpr before newcastle make it permanent , won't happen though .
that of newcastle is a . 
remy !!! 0-1 newcastle
winters gambling tips of the day was newcastle man city swansea and scum
i'm liking the way newcastle are defending . much like arsenal , sit back , soak then press when they get close .
commentary : " newcastle with their size have an advantage on [ corners] "... yeah but it's a corner so ... no ?
gomes is definitely a better keeper than friedel 
consecutive defensive errors eventually lead to a goal from newcastle . kinda saw it coming . if you fall off a horse get back on ! 
loic remy first goalscorer newcastle 1 up v tottenham !!
what's with newcastle's kit ? brazil ? 
remy a quality signing for newcastle
yes newcastle !!
c'mon newcastle üì¢
yessss newcastle
tottenham , city and arsenal have to lose today
spurs - newcastle
tottenham used to be so good to watch , but they've got slower and slower in posession under avb - there's a lack of tempo to their play .
wow newcastle looking like a revived team
go on newcastle !!!!
newcastle match & a fry to begin the day :)

i think remy was made to score for and was made to be running around like chicken for 
tottenham's keeper makes dustin fletcher look like a young whippersnapper

newcastle think they are brazil in that kit there , s only one brazil that's coventry 
i have a confession , my first ever football shirt was a newcastle one . i can't even explain why it was
friedel isn't good enough for tottenham anymore
also why are newcastle trying to copy arsenals kit ? üëÄ
come on newcastle !!!
remy is a top class player and he's hinted he won't sign permanently for newcastle .
newcastle winning , please stay like that !!

what's with everyone's away kit being the brazil colours ? first arsenal now newcastle !!!
come on newcastle posotive start 
gol de newcastle : remy . tottenham 0 - newcastle 1 .
is it fair to think that lloris would've perhaps been off his line quickly to clear the ball , for newcastle's goal ?
come on tottenham you can do this ....
newcastle should better find a way papis cisse will start scoring again , because bigger teams are coming for loic remy in january .
no offence to brad but all of a sudden we look shaky at the back against an average newcastle side . more than a coincidence . 
hope newcastle dominate this game
lol newcastle
fucking tottenham !
presumably avb will blame paulinho losing possession for newcastle's goal on the spurs fans ?
so newcastle copy of arsenals away kit ... aye .
newcastle wearing our away kit ... no wonder they're playing so well
newcastle beating tottenham at white hart lane . not surprised actually .

debuchy has a tramp stamp 
tottenham struggle to score goals . they don't need to look far for the answer .

proper want newcastle to win this
newcastle burning their way to the top tho .
loic remy has scored seven goals in his last seven premier league appearances . [ opta ]
newcastle already time wasting , only 20 minutes in .

newcastle se relance bien
i like newcastle , but i don't like their yellow away kit .
 needs more pressure
let's all laugh at tottenham ! 17 ' spurs 0-1 new castle -(rs )
newcastle could have got remy much cheaper during the summer !
newcastle have started well 
newcastle look like they think they're brazil .. ha more like motherwell with wonga sponsorship . 
first time in my 8 years of supporting tottenham that i can't see us scoring more than once , as soon as we concede we dont win
go through to the kitchen to make spaghetti hoops , come back through to see newcastle have scored . that's not ok . 
newcastle beat spurs !!!
come on newcastle !!!!!!!!!!
newcastle are flying . 
that spurs defence looks dodgy today , way too much space and open holes everywhere . all newcastle need is a head down & a run through .
1 goal buat newcastle
didn't realise spurs were playing brazil 
howay newcastle ! pile on the pressure ! 
come on newcastle ! great start . like watching brazil ;) 
dawson gets out of jail there - loses possession in newcastle's half but remy offside for the through ball .
theres nobody to bale tottenham out
tottenham team just now for me is 11 players . not 1 team . they need time to gel . but they need to do it quick . 
no englishman has scored for newcastle in the epl this year .
why are newcastle playing brazils 82 kit ??
andre villas-boas has again said that he has no plans to sell tottenham fringe striker jermain defoe in the january transfer window .
newcastle's leading . oh wow , spurs .
tottenham can't play this high line without lloris in goal , remy will tear them apart
tottenham will make a move for manchester united's 25-year-old striker javier hernandez in january if they can transfer 29-year-old emmanuel
loic remy scores to give newcastle united the lead against spurs . 1-0 -m3551

newcastle : an english team with a lot of french players who are playing in brazil's kit 
glad i left tottenham out of my accumulator

if today scores via a penalty , then this will be a malicious way to win games ... 
don't often say this but would love newcastle to beat spurs !
newcastle fans cheering loic remy sums up how fickle football fans are
tottenham have been so flat and it is down to the amount of changes made in the summer .
haha come on newcastle trend the away win today
newcastle's away kit looks like the mighty p&t panthers
that yid ban has done tottenham no favours
fredil having a gomes-esc game : creating more newcastle chanes than preventing . paulinhio and dembele looking hapless as well .

newcastle have looked to play right through spurs cbs at least 5 times ... & scored doing so . i'd be concerned if i was avb . 
this chiriches defends like david luiz , he's all over the place . obviously a weak link in the defense and newcastle will look to exploit
tottenham are actually so shit at the moment . avb needs to sort it out

decent a fiver @ 9/1 had a nice winner on ( premier league tottenham v newcastle ) with - 
i don't get why tottenham don't play through soldado or give him chances it makes no sense having a good , goalscoring striker and not
the keeper is standing in the way of tottenham hostpur equalizer .
newcastle players time wasting in the first half üòÇ
newcastle always seem to bag
i like the way newcastle's strikers , instead of pressing spurs ' defence , block passes into paulinho-demb√©l√© - leave dawson on the ball .
got out the bath and newcastle are winning yay
need newcastle , sunderland and man united to win today , or at least draw
mod tonight 1 ) spurs vs newcastle 2 ) sunderland afc vs manchester city 3 ) manchester united vs arsenal 4 ) swansea afc vs stoke city

big game day 
newcastle 1-0 up , which means no 6 points for dawson today . 
newcastle are playing like brazil in their new kits . spurs can be finland 
i bet you tottenham will get a last 5 min goal
remy scores for newcastle against spurs . loris would've saved that
nice game newcastle
newcastle playing in a brazil kit ! 
the thing with newcastle is they never seem to keep a clean sheet .
top save by 
didn't actually expect to see newcastle winning get in !!

just like west ham , the newcastle barcodes are an awful team ... leave it to spurs to make em look like world beaters ! 
this match proves that newcastle is not a mediocre team ...... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . spurs is
do not want newcastle to win , or i'll have a very grumpy other half later .
as for 2011-12 , refereeing mistakes meant arsenal should have finished behind tottenham hotspur for the first time in the wenger era ,
what a great save by krul , newcastle far better side first half
newcastle leading .. muhahahahahahahaha hold on newcastle . you have 3m+ gooners on your side tonight !

tottenham hotspurs .. ¬£101 million in signings ( majority forwards ) & only 9 goals scored .. how tf are they in the top 8 ???
soldado claims to be spanish but his massive nose shows he's just a tottenham jew
tottenham with all the possession but no lk ,,,,, sorry
newcastle havin a few breathers .
need sunderland and newcastle to win . then we need to do out bit at 4:10 pm 
in saying that newcastle win here and a arsenal draw later would go down a treat .
yes newcastle !
nw : newcastle- tothenam .
in 1996/97 united were 5 points behind newcastle after 10 matches - won the league with 7 points .
if remy doesn't come off newcastle are literally hitler .

70% possession and still a goal down 
newcastle must think they're brazil with that away kit
love how tottenham always try to put arsenal down , yet they always finish below us and seem to think soldado is better than ozilüòÇ cunts
might jump off 9ers if newcastle beat us
i'll be a very happy man if tottenham and arsenal lose today .
spurs game could go either way but newcastle are looking good but spurs are the better side at the moment 1-0 still newcastle
newcastle , sunderland and arsenal to win , 62/1 . i will be a very happy boy if that comes in !!

the newcastle physios pumas ! <3
i recon hugo lloris would of been off his line quicker than big brad and maybe even saved newcastle's goal . v 
really don't want to lose to newcastle just because i hate pardew so fucking much
guy fouls soldado in the box , barely touches the back of another player then lies down for ten minutes . 
my dad will be totally proud when i tell him i've been watching the tottenham match
my dream end to the prem weekend .. - newcastle win - man utd/arsenal draw - city to win yaya toure to score again !
newcastle singing tottenhams a shithole is rather ironic
newcastle score anyone ?
 v ... dad's happier as newcastle ( his team ) are 1-0 up ! next match vs 
flicked on the footy after hearing it was 1-0 to someone . i nearly had a heart attack when it turned out to be newcastle .
i want tottenham to lose as well . i hate having to depend on other teams results but cfc aren't playing to well atm . man city to lose too .
tottenham hotspur : scum of the league .
newcastle are on fire lately
half an hour played at white hart lane !!! newcastle united still in control here . tottenham hotspur 0-1 newcastle united , now .
 down 1-0 to .... this league is gettin interesting ...
tottenham are a horrible horrible club
been a good game so far newcastle playing well still want a draw tho
newcastle fans calling tottenham a shit hole ? literally the only club that comes from a bigger dump .
cocky newcastle fans we want to go home
in the league this season suarez & sturridge 16 goals tottenham 9 goals
come on tottenham get into the toon !!
this is newcastle !!! you know fucking shambles joe kinear etc etc
newcastle are playing better football
remy and cabaye need to move , they are too good for newcastle
definatly a fan of newcastle's away kit
* me watching tottenham v newcastle * brother-what's ye th stand for ? are they playing new york kill me
chris houghton , newcastle hero .

outstanding save by krul to keep it 0-1 . newcastle playing some nice football . sensing spurs will step up a gear . vs 
am i watching brazil or newcastle !?
i still don't think newcastle is gon ' win tho
newcastle goal ! ( sorry late for the tweet lunch )
the goal was avoidable . lloris plays sweeper and friedel doesn't . defence haven't adjusted so there's more space for newcastle in behind .
we are tottenham and we need a penalty !
newcastle on the ready !
great save from krul to deny soldado header . tottenham finding their feet
get in newcastle ! fuck off yids .
i see newcastle going for the brazil look with their kit today

newcastle win is 2.30 still
newcastle r looking like arsenal !
big problem for newcastle if remy has to go off .
thumbsup fernando torres going tottenham in january thumbsup
should realise to never put tottenham on my football bets on account on the fact they are overrated and shit
newcastle better hope remy is fine
never thought i'd find myself cheering for newcastle . but the tall poppy in me loves tottenham losing . 
soldado makes it 3-2 to tottenham from the spot . his 100th goal for spurs of which 94 are penalties .
i actually like newcastle's away kit . its colourful .
look at the newcastle medics wearing rubber gloves that match their kit ....
hopefully newcastle & sunderland do justice and we win , make this a perfect day !
newcastle's brazil kit is funny as fuck .
newcastle will have a big problem if r√©my can't play on ...
come on newcastle . if scum loose today and when they loose next week omg
 tottenham hotspur vs newcastle united
newcastle will be contenders for the top 4 if they play like this for the rest of the season
why . do . tottenham . fans . chant . everything . so . slowly .

this newcastle kit looks like mike ashley got a good deal on brazil kits in sports direct then ruined them with a massive wonga sign
dunno who to blame , this is just not tottenham we all know

looooool spurs . come one newcastle !
newcastle +2 at 4/9 looks like a good steal
two-bob clive allen saying tottenham are a club that prefer a 4-3 to a 1-0 win !! ok pal ! score 3 first !!

remember newcastle , he's only on loan 
who scored for newcastle ?
remy down for newcastle . medics on pitch . walking wounded .
newcastle are on some form
goal spurs 0-1 newcastle ( 13 mins ) gouffran slips the ball through to loic remy , who takes it around friedel before slotting home 
so chris hughton is at the tottenham game

honestly wanted remy over soldado in the summer . i'm not just saying that now because newcastle are winning through him
newcastle , sunderland & utd wins will do nicely and we'll slip into 5th for the international break 
hootun in the crowd at the newcastle game
how to be a newcastle player : 1 . be french 2 . be tall 3 . moan at anything

newcastle doing very well , but clubs not supposed to lose to them at home 
common newcastle u can go home with all 3 point if u keep the pressure high
yes come on newcastle
newcastle is leading ? gorgeous !
on recent matches doubt tottenham will score more than 1 in this match .. that will also probably be a penalty .
none of the 33 goals newcastle have scored in 2013 have been scored by an englishman 
sissoko , remy , cabaye , tiote .... newcastle have got some really good players who can hold the ball well
have tottenham even scored 2 goals in a game this season ? 
can't take away newcastle's performance , but tottenham don't have any shape
newcastle are giving spurs a decent game here like
weird seeing newcastle play in yellow
come on u newcastle ! :)

yes newcastle
come on newcastle üëä
ok , that last one was a stretch . no more brazil related newcastle united tweets . dunga nuff damage to my rep already .
tottenham should just buy ramires and young ... then soldado would win golden boot and tottenham would win the league ...
the current spurs newcastle score is lovely
why are newcastle brazil what year is this
who's stupid idea was it to make newcastle's away kit yellow and blue ?
nice 3-1 win , scored another goal ! and newcastle are winninggg 
when i think of newcastle i think of fat bald headed guys with loads of gold loop earrings
newcastle currently showing the sort of form that had them challenging for 4th a couple of seasons ago .
tottenham are so dull
tottenham and newcastle is a cracking game
tottenham dont do this to me pleasr
loic remy has scored 47% of newcastle's pl goals this season ; the highest proportion of any player in the top-flight . [ opta ]
the problem is we seem to be playing brazil rather than newcastle . 
we need two wingers on here and and use pace . nothing happening on the left side . its comfy for newcastle right now
just imagine if newcastle won , sunderland won and arsenal won 
just noticed newcastle are playing in durham colours
tottenham have won the league twice in their history . arsenal have won the league twice at white hart lane .
decided i hate newcastle !
 too slow for remy 
way to high a line tottenham !
unfortunately i still think tottenham might win
anybody else getting poor quality picture quality on tottenham v newcastle ? jumping all over the shop here !
tottenham are one of the most frustrating teams to watch
tottenham are actually so boring to watch
tottenham have won the league twice in their history . arsenal have won the league twice at white hart lane .

i don't like watching tottenham anymore we don't play like we used tooüòí
spurs vs newcastle , federer vs nadal and united vs arsenal . bring it on ! 
best result for tottenham today would be a draw . the have never scored more than once in this campaign . newcastle can be relish on that .
i hope newcastle wins against shitty spuds

newcastle look hard to break down
how much for a season ticket at tottenham ?
h'way the lads ! tottenham have to score 2 . they can't score so they will lose !
tottenham's best attacking threat is the cb chiriches
if newcastle took shola am a donkey off & had someone else on in place of him they'd be 3 or 4 goals up by now .
save from krul to fend off soldado's header was just world class ! will be a good weekend for if it remains this way

tottenham don't look like scoring , soldado not as prolific a striker as they obviously hoped , and you need one for that system 
hard to tell if newcastle are playing well or spurs just terrible .
how did tottenham spend a 100 million and still manages to be an average team ?
tottenham losing at home to newcy ! love it !!!!! 
newcastle's keeper is putting in workkk
tottenham are so boring to watch
tottenham fans creating a nervous negative , atmosphere for their team once again .
loving the tottenham support ... 
at whitehart lane . tottenham 0 - 1 newcastle . were is paulinho , lamela , soldado ? if you ask me .
at first i thought kendel was joking with this newcastle thing .. guy seem proper serious lol
really want newcastle to rape tottenham so united have a chance of europa league football
newcastle beating spurs would be absolutely fantastic for us . 
tottenham need to equalise before half time
early fixtures means early brunch ... spurs v newcastle on now and breakfast is ready ...
bishop stortford , newcastle united , and arsenal , to win today please 
newcastle dominating
tottenham are shitüòÇüòÇ
come on newcastle ! great start
normally i wouldn't be too happy with newcastle winning , but i do have l√∂ic remy in my fantasy team so can't really complain too much
tottenham looking poor toady
how can tottenham be losing f me
why watch tottenham vs newcastle when you can watch liverpool on motd again .
tottenham look good coming forward but unless they get a pen i can't see them scoring atm
and we need newcastle match to stay as it is
good news is that tottenham are losing . bad news is that remy has messed up my fantasy team 
tim krul playing well for newcastle .. 
newcastle looking better ...!
hopefully the newcastle kit will remind avb of his desire to manage in brazil ... imagine what they'd make of his negativity over there ...
newcastle lead tottenham ! lovely goal from remy who rounded the keeper and tapped in ! 0-1 
just got in and turned the football on , looks like spuds are losing to brazil but it turns out its newcastle in disguise .
avb's complacency i guess . maybe he didn't realised newcastle really improved this season .
songs of praise is more exciting than the football tottenham play !
newcastle have improved big time
tottenham are looking dog shote today
nothings better then waking up on a sunday to tottenham losing
can't believe that newcastle united player was allowed to keep playing after bumping his head . alan pardew is virtually a murderer . pc
wow was that a shot from a tottenham player 
thinks this 12pm kick off is a bit harsh on newcastle fans . the tv companies do not care for the match going fans .
newcastle united are bringing some crazy at whitehart lane . pardew is almost a top manager .
credit to newcastle , they're keeping up the pace !
goal ! tottenham 0 newcastle 1 alan shearer thunders home ! 
 tottenham - newcastle
come on newcastle make my nan and grandad proud üëå
i still can't believe tottenham got eriksen
loic remy cost newcastle ¬£2m(loan fee ) soldado cost spurs ¬£26m .
back from taking the dogs for a walk to find tottenham 1-0 down , :d
glad i‚Äôm not a tottenham supporter at the moment .
dickheads . how are we 0-1 to newcastle ? wtf .
is that brazil or newcastle ?
tottenham are looking wobbly hahaha !
tottenham doesnt stand a chance .
did someone feed the tottenham team lasagna again ?
tottenham killing me here man
go on newcastle 
nice to see newcastle play with confidence , making little mistakes but not letting it drag their performance down 
tottenham this season = 9 goals luis suarez = 9 goals ( and suarez hasn't played 5 games )
watching de downfall of tottenham
spurs 0-1 newcastle - 37mins gone and eriksen warms the hands of krul & spurs almost leave the back door open 
more speed in the build up please tottenham 
the boy can certainly finish ... it's loic remy for newcastle , 1-0 !
get a grip tottenham for fuck sake !
üòÇüòÇ tottenham playing sooo shit
newcastle playin good football ...
tottenham always trynna get balls into the box via wide play . smfh ,

tottenham de play dead yes boss
newcastle controlling this game brilliantly .
newcastle pressing well
eriksen puts a shot in and nearly catches krul off guard , newcastle still looking the better team in this /andy mfc
if newcastle can nick a win at spurs , today could be a very , very special day . 
newcastle look a lot more dangerous going forward . spurs not carrying much of a threat . too slow , too predictable

newcastle look slick today . spurs still don't look like a cohesive team after all these signings .
newcastle looking dangerous
tottenham's tv camera angle is unbelievably shit .

newcastle have been class here first half .
omfd ! it's only fuckin newcastle -__-
nearly 2-0 newcastle ! great call by the linesman .
yes newcastle
ref should have allowed that goal just because ameobi went passed the keeper 
tottenham lucky ameobi was offside then , they were cut apart by newcastle .
fuck i hope remy transfers to newcastle , very good forward
spurs have been poor but newcastle have been hugely impressive . win against chelsea seems to have them brimming with confidence
newcastle are popping when in possession
at least i don't mind newcastle .. but we really need to bring lamela on
get in newcastle ! 
newcastle ripping tottenham apart
some great play from newcastle but they're being helped an awful lot by spurs just standing off them . anyone but ameobi and that's a goal
tottenham are losing to brazil ??
is it me or is th the newcastle alternate kit similar 2 arsenals'! no wonder they winning .. remy on point
spurs are playing that bad , they're making newcastle look like the holland team from the 70's !
spurs , apparently sacrificing creativity in midfield for solidity , are being torn apart by newcastle . what are they even trying to do ?
that was close , offside saves really playing well 
who'd of thought watching paint dry is more exciting than watching tottenham .
newcastle playing with a swagger .
newcastle played very well .. spurs ? show us tht u r worthy to be on top .
watching tottenham nowadays is painful
newcastle playing lovely 1 touch football tottenham playing slow predictable football
newcastle playing some good stuff here against spurs . 
newcastle are looking pretty decent
no english player has scored for newcastle this season
tottenham vs st. francis ? newcastle's strip is the exact double . francis 
hopefully newcastle play this well in the second half
newcastle playing wonderful football today , taking tottenham to the cleaners . 
tottenham struggling
i think newcastle are getting atleast 1 point , can't see spurs getting 2 penalties
city win , arsenal draw and tottenham loose would be a perfect afternoon
newcastle need to sign remy at the end of the season ! he's been quality
newcastle look like bloody world beaters . fucking hell spurs , up your game . wide players have done shit all . 
two big wins for newcastle if they see off spurs , looking like the team they were 2 seasons ago !
fuck sake tottenham
if newcastle start becoming consistent , then something is very wrong in this world .
must be hard being a newcastle fan , can be amazing like this first 45 or awful like first half at everton 
nuu ff newcastle ta ganhando no white hart lane
as good as he is , newcastle are a diff side without ben arfa
i wonder how shay given is doing after leaving newcastle ...
spurs need to speed their play up . newcastle are doing them
tbh i don't actually care who wins now , i just used to fancy tottenham
newcastle look deadly going forward today !
when's somebody at tottenham hotspur going to wake up and smell the coffee and realise that michael dawson is the worst footballer ever
need a goal from tottenham !
how good do newcastle look going forward !
newcastle given spurs a lesson here !
come on newcastle and come on united , never thought i'd ever say that
ozil is clearly a class above cabaye but the newcastle midfielder has been superb since his arsenal fiasco . few better in pl right now 
one of the poorest halfs of football i've seen tottenham play in a while , poor all over the park
newcastle come to whl to win and really do their homework 
erikson is tottenham's only decent player
tottenham need to wise up here , slow , sloppy , careless
either newcastle are very good today or spurs are very poor . can't make my mind up
of course i'm not reveling in how shit tottenham have been today . i'm reveling in how shit tottenham have been this entire year .
i know 442 is frowned upon but get lennon on right townsend on left lamela with soldado and av a right go 2nd half the tottenham way 
i genuinely get pleasure when i see spurs struggle/drop points . go on newcastle ! 
newcastle are playing some good stuff
fair play to newcastle , giving it a go , spurs shaky at the back , still 1-0 newcastle
long way to go but newcastle looking very good . pardew would've been under some pressure if they lost to chelsea and spurs after sunderland .
offside goals doesn't count if it's shola . 2-0 newcastle .
newcastle knocking it about very nice an with ease . tottenham just don't look like scoring . lennon , bale , vdvaart ... 
40 ' spurs 0-1 newcastle ( remy) . comeonyouspurs ! 
yes newcastle !
newcastle all over tottenham , rightfully deserve their 1-0 lead . .
happy newcastle beating spurs
i like the way newcastle are playing !! 
now i know why beat last week 
spurs spent a substantial amount of money in the summer . the fact that they're losing to a weakened newcastle side perplexes me .
newcastle have to be the most inconsistent team in this league 
in from football we lost but we played well ! now watching the tottenham vs newcastle ! come on newcastle !!!! 
newcastle thinking there brazil with that kit
i really want newcastle to win !!!
newcastle balling good
this isn't the tottenham we know
plz manchester united en newcastle ... win !
i'll be surprised if tottenham don't score tbh
newcastle and cabye are controlling this game .

newcastle are playing great football
newcastle on the other hand look immense going forward ! looking forward to seeing it in a few weeks at st james's park ! 
tottenham players are rattled by their own mistakes regarding goal conceded . they & crowd need to calm down & carry on . just believe ! 
what is wrong with tottenham's formation ? it's all over the place .
newcastle look good against the spuds hahaha
why put a newcastle away game at 12pm ? poor away fans must have had to leave around 4am . sky have no care or thought for football fans . 
the combo of spurs playing shit and newcastle playing well is pissing me off greatly
newcastle playing some nice football ... great running off the ball and quick passing
no one to ' bale ' tottenham out this time round
i fancy newcastle to see this out

from what i can tell from twitter , tottenham create chance after chance . hopefully only a matter of time now , until we score
tottenham will be all over us second half !! 
tottenham's defence doing a good job so far . a lot of offside's newcastle has conceded .
newcastle's strikers need to stop getting caught offside , could be 3/4 up with better times runs
we're playing like stoke , we're playing like stooooke , we're tottenham hotspur , but we're playing like stoke 
newcastle and southampton has to be the dark horses of this season ! what do you guys think ? < am >
slow , precdictable and sloppy from us townsand is not tracking so ever with walker trying to handle two newcastle players ! were pony
remyy was a bargain for newcastle 
city win , arsenal draw and tottenham lose would be the ideal results today

newcastle are making tottenham look ordinary here , keep it up boys .
lol what the hell did tottenham spend all that money on ? their build up is way too slow . cunts
1st half shows urge of newcastle vs dirge of spurs . why lamela hasn't started after thurs goodness only knows .

its fair to say newcastle have done there homework
tottenham are so boring to watch
spurs need a shake up . half chances at home is not good enough . newcastle in control . 
tottenham need to change the way they play , 9 goals this season is shocking
newcastle are playing brilliant football
mad ting , newcastle are sticking it on tottenham
tottenham aren't too far behind norwich when it comes to zero movement
tottenham have got the best centre half in the league playing at left back .. ridiculous

newcastle playing out of their skin , and spurs have been a pile of shit
wtf do tottenham think they're achieving from passing the ball backwards and forwards across the pitch ?!
quite like the newcastle away strip
loic remy just put newcastle ahead of spurs , this dude has been consistent right from lorient and at qpr as well , wenger please he's enough
you would think with the sun in the eye of the newcastle keeper , spurs would be taking more shots but not really . newcastle dee is on point .
either are playing brilliant or are playing shit , newcastle should be 3 or 4 nil up !!!!
newcastle defending awesomely !
40 min ... tottenham 0-1 * newcastle ( remy 13 )

so chilled on the sofa . watching newcastle all over spurs . banging headache though
this newcastle side are so unpredictable
dare i say newcastle are playing not too bad looking pretty organised , krul playing a blinder so far so good for my coupon üòâ
considering the players they have tottenham are incredibly boring .
credit to newcastle . their pressing in the midfield has been pretty good and look dangerous whenever they go forward .
who is this team and what have they done with the real newcastle ? 
and the tottenham attack is flat as a pancake at the moment . struggling to think of many more boring/frustrating teams to watch .
newcastle 1- tottenham 0 first half almost finished .
spuds defence is all over the place . keep it up newcastle
tottenham are playing awfully well for fuck sake
it's wierd seeing newcastle in yellow . it's just like watching brazil ... not
spurs havent won 1 50/50 yet , newcastle all over them
tottenham are pure gash !
this is the worst i've seen spurs so far . wouldn't think they were competing for top four and newcastle are competing for ... emm ... well ....

newcastle's left side are causing problems for tottenham
can i just point out that i put ¬£25 on that newcastle would win 2-1 .
newcastle looking the better team so far , because , well , because they are the better team .
newcastle is battering spurs at home , possession : 40-60

mystery revealed - tottenham is shit
tottenham look shit
watching tottenham just pisses me off now , just frustrating considering we can't break anyone down
newcastle ils sont chauds
spurs could learn a thing or two from newcastle on how to work the ball quickly from one box to the other . awfully slow and lacking ideas .
tottenham may well come back and win this game , and i know this is a whole new side , but right now spurs are dire .
tottenham are so fucking shit , what's wrong with them !
for all this hype tottenham have been shocking fans and players
don't understand why defoe doesn't start for tottenham ! ‚öΩÔ∏è
happy with newcastle taking the lead , bodes well for my only draw on today's acca !
so newcastle lead thanks to remy's lovely goal , where he rounded friedel and tapped in !
watching tottenham vs newcastle bc i have nothing to watch
40 minutes gone and we're making tottenham look like an average team

chris * hughton , newcastle hero .
when newcastle win a few they get confident .
every time a tottenham player get the ball there is no player within 20 yards for a pass ! please help your teammates out !
no wonder my neighbourhood is as quiet as edmonton cemetery . tottenham is losing to newcastle
will be a good day if newcastle hang on to beat the spurs scum and man utd turn arsenal over !
maybe every season the newcastle away kit should be a blatant copy of a great team to inspire confidence . 
newcastle looking comfortable at 3 point lane üé£

tottenham fans please boo at half time .

newcastle bossing at the minute . genuinely celebrated a minute ago as well .. thought shola had scored :-(

collective moan . story of tottenham a season
newcastle making spurs look distinctly average here . maybe that's just because spurs are distinctly average .
newcastle are looking really good but we need to sort our defence out
tottenham will never challenge for the title simply because they find it so difficult to score goals 
tottenham are shocking

tottenham fans can moan all they like your team shocking
if i have to watch that tottenham right hand side for england i will despair , its over rated and in my opinion , average .
loic remy's acceleration and twinkle toes are a delight . why is he playing for newcastle ?
newcastle are playing brilliant football , all over spurs
newcastle united send me bonkers ! 
tottenham are just sh*t
newcastle need to score before ht ... or soldado will get a penalty in 2nd half !! i'm sure of this !

krul is saving newcastle's arse !!
42 ' paulinho ............ . | tottenham hotspur 0 - 1(remy 12 ' ) newcastle | 
krul keeping newcastle in the game
newcastle very disciplined in defence . krul on fire even with the sun in his eyes .
another good save by krul , from paulinho's shot , still 1-0 to newcastle
newcastle look so well drilled , got there game plan spot on
who is going to bail tottenham out today . life without bale . .
its too easy for newcastle . which is what i want
haway tottenham man ! get those sexy arses in gear ! 
tottenham fans are poor
newcastle doing well if they beat spurs away after chelsea win last week aswell !
have to say newcastle look pretty cohesive at the moment ; remy always a threat , cabaye in top form . fans still using wrong hashtag tho 
newcastle still with the lead .. keeping it up at the moment
krul is saving newcastle . man has gone super saiyan
pauliho with a shot ; but krul saves again ! the newcastle goalkeeper's on fire !
what a save krul . he's doing well this game . come on newcastle !
as possible as i can go there 
yes newcastle
cabaye needs to leave newcastle . top footballer wasted amongst a bagga average players
newcastle playing some good stuff
tottenham hotspur playing against brazi ... oh it's newcastle united .
tottenham make me wanna cry
loic remy cost newcastle ¬£2m(loan fee ) soldado cost spurs ¬£26m soooo funny
 looks like the only player looking capable of breaking down
just score 2 more goals newcastle so i can go drink in peace .
newcastle should think about making remy's loan deal permanent ! he's been on fire this season .
newcastle dey vess sha . i hope dey win :)
tottenham are so boring to watch
oh ! another great save from newcastle's goalie
galls me to say but newcastle fully deserve their lead
1-0 newcastle da hell and no lorris .....
surprised how newcastle r playing this good against a team that spent so much ¬£¬£ considering they couldn't beat sunderland # 
avb needs to change his system here . townsend running down dead ends . too easy for newcastle defense with just soldado 
it's hard being a newcastle fan because deep down you usually just assume the other team is better than you and going to strike at any time .
tottenham vs newcastle . manchester city vs sunderland . manchester united vs arsenal . 
go newcastle !!!! ‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è beat those scumy spurs !!! plz üòÉ
i think 2nd half newcastle are gonna be laughing sun in the keepers eyes 
it has been very krul on tottenham so far
newcastle however look like they are starting to gel as a team , expect a top 10 or even 8 finish from them 
does anyone know the score for newcastle game
but as i said i wont bank on a newcastle clean sheet
huge huge day of sport planned 12:00 spurs v newcastle 14:05 sunderland v man city 16:10 man utd v arsenal
kurl is on fire have a feeling it may be one of those days now ive said it tottenham will batter them come on newcastle !
arsenal should get remy as a backup for giroud . he is doing so well in newcastle , imagine him being played in from √∂zil and santi . 
 tottenham - newcastle
impressed with newcastle . especially with remy and krul .
that's twice now krul has kept newcastle ahead , two great saves !
newcastle's away jersey is the same as that of arsenal's .
said we're from newcastle lastnight , some bastard shouted ' 2-1 ', aye , fucking shat all over him when i said i was a sunderland fan , bastard
that point against newcastle is looking like a good point now
spurs are hammering newcastle
newcastle always seem to have top keepers ?
gardien de newcastle la est batard hein .
tottenham krul-y denied again ! 
krul playing really well 
what's up with tottenham !? there playing shit !! they need defoe on 
ooups newcastle 
have i really just seen a girl tweet ' spurs are all over tottenham '.. is she being serious !! lool
newcastle look soo comfortable
certainly can't use the ' parking the bus ' excuse this time - surprisingly newcastle not adopting it despite being ahead .
come on newcastle ! fuck off you spurs 
remy should of signed for newcastle straight away ! and should sign for them in the summer !
newcastle are playing decent today !
krul keeping newcastle at 1-0
ffs didn't realise tottenham kicked off at 12 fantasy football ruined
needs to play two strikers in this team . need to buy a new forwwrd in january if we want top 4 
you know what they say , if remy scores on 16 minutes newcastle win the game . fact . can't make that shit up !
tottenham are actually pish
krul playing like a machine ! 
newcastle
newcastle goal keeper deserves a cookie seriously , the damn saves
come on newcastle . beat that spuds .
i jou bien newcastle
village idiot's highline and pressing playing well in hands for newcastle .
tottenham just ain't looking good at all at the moment , still fancy them to get the win though
newcastle are all over this game - loving it !: ) 
remy will have a good season and newcastle will start to come good . 
spurs really struggling to create anything of real danger , newcastle utd well worth their 1-0 lead so far 
i follow back instantly !!! exo newcastle christmas justin bieber arsenal
tottenham behind , who woulda thought .
another good save by krul 
so far krul has saved newcastle's lead , keeping out efforts from paulinho , soldado and eriksen .
newcastle's keeper is saving them at the moment ! making some big saves
as soon as spurs up the tempo and switch point of attack newcastle struggle . it's not sustained enough though .
newcastle are decent .
been told by numerous people that this tottenham team is the best team they've seen in there lifetime , there is no reason why we shouldn't
come on newcastle
newcastle be playing tottenham lyk child's play .....
some big saves by krul so far 
krul for man of the half , exceptional saves to keep newcastle one nil up 
without krul newcastle would be fecked . liking newcastle tempo mid - to - front .
krul preserving newcastle's lead with 2 fantastic saves from soldado and now paulinho
if newcastle get win then arsenal beat man u , ill be happy .
typical tottenham corner , can't beat the first man , gotta start giving out fines at the club it's fuckin schoolboy .
newcastle are lucky that krul is having a blinder
the way newcastle are playing here , don't feel so bad about drawing with them . really crisp passing , keeping possession , and a demon remy
would like to see cabaye at united . guy would get better with better players around him . 10 mill and newcastle will fold .
come on newcastle ! keep it going boys
come on newcastle üòÜ
haha newcastle are already 1 nil up ahaha !
hopes for the day : newcastle win , sunderland win , arsenal embarrass united . 
it'd be funny if newcastle fans sang " it's just like watching brazil ." cos they know they're watching newcastle , they just look like brazil .
newcastle players r on roids !!!
so newcastle is leading ? cool
maths revision sorry did you mean tottenham game 
spurs don't look great but krul has saved newcastle 3 times now .. just need an equaliser ! 
damn krul . able to save trice in blinding light . he's good . 
just got in . hold on newcastle ! spurs been rubbish again ? no surprise .
however , yohan cabaye is a quality player who belongs in a better side than newcastle imo .
go on newcastle !!!!
tottenham losing to newcastle at home . .. after spending so much .
fuck off newcastle you are ruining my bet on first game !
krul is playing incredibly , especially considering that sun is staring him in the eyes the whole time . 
dembele has been terrible . seem to remember him struggling against newcastle last season too . he needs to come off
come on newcastle üòÉ
dinny understand how defoe can be kept out eh that tottenham team when there strugglin for goals
newcastle tottenham game isn't entertaining me that much . someone needs to score before ht
tottenham are so slow and lazy on the ball
tottenham have got to be the most boring team to watch in the league there the new blackburn 
newcastle have been very strong , hopefully they keep it up
yes newcastle hahaha
newcastle are pretty decent . spurs having a good half offensively , creating much better chances than recently . they miss lloris at the back
spurs 0-1 newcastle !
so i'm meeting this game now and why are we losing to fvcking newcastle at white hart lane ?
tottenham need a system that allows dembele to play further up the pitch
 think they are ha ha ha ha
if tottenham wins today on penalties once again , god is biased
newcastle please win this match .
breakfast , tottenham/newcastle , city/sunderland , united/arsenal ... the most chilled out day ever !!
well newcastle can fuck off .....
pretty comfortable for newcastle . spurs having the ball but creating little . money well spent avb . 
i see some people are moaning about the team , formation amd not giving newcastle credit for playing well
no wonder united fans love tottenham . they are üíØ% similar
a win today will push us to 5th if tottenham lose today's game !! 
newcastle can be called london killers .
tottenham do not look like a top four team at all 
foul against newcastle
when i was in france they played man city and i was mocked by a french guy on the street for wearing my kit . " oh newcastle ! you are losing !"
spurs build up so slowly , just letting newcastle players get back ! avb you need a change lad , dull at most ..
spurs need someone to hold the ball in the middle . it's too easy for newcastle as it is .
if it wasn't for tim krul newcastle would be about 2 or 3 down
i want to put money on a tottenham win still but just can't , got to play it safe . 
photography and tottenham vs newcastleüíÅ
newcastle leading 1-0 .. didn't expect that !
if spurs have lamella or lennon on bench need least 1 of them on and get behind newcastle and give soldado something to feed off
this tottenham squad reminds me of man city a few seasons ago with robinho , elano etc . good individual players but not that solid as a team
 ‚Äì goal alert : tottenham hotspur 0-1 * newcastle united *( remy 13 ‚Äô) 
i think a large portion of my hatred for newcastle stems from their kit . this yellow and blue ensemble is quite calming .
the jews love tottenham
newcastle are playing so well ..
newcastle have been excellent this first half here , right through from krul to remy ! cabaye is a joy to watch when enjoying his football !
newcastle are looking decent here . spurs fans are killing their boys with all the moaning .
just woke up and seen the spuds score , who scored for newcastle ?
hope newcastle hold on to this .
tim krul i want what ever youv been eating this morning 
if tottenham lose southampton are top 4 at the end of today whatever happens wooo
newcastle are a bit rough arent they ?
nothing better than a sunday dinner with the newcastle match on and them winning ! 
tim krul is the best goalkeeper in the world . how he's keeping newcastle in this game is unreal .
newcastle > brazil
newcastle are actually playing quite well
go newcastle !

newcastle can actually play some decent football
tottenham fans love a moan . we got a throw in ? why isn't it a goal ? boooooo

krul is on fire , 3 or 4 top notch saves keeping newcastle in the game
fouls on the half way line . cynical newcastle
soldado offers nothing to tottenham
tottenham what is this

townsend is gonna have to vary his game 2nd half , newcastle keep sending 3 man out to him
if you were a tottenham player , why would you ever want to play at home ? horrible environment .
newcastle playing some good football , so much for tottenham's 100mil + summer transfers what a shame 
come home to see newcastle leading .... yh

gutted am missing the newcastle match to play my second of the day :(
dembele is total fucking shank today #44fucking2
for a moment , i thought newcastle was arsenal , that away kit looks so similar ..
newcastle are playing like brasil , look at the passing feck
how could anyone think that this tottenham team are title contenders . some good players in a negative system . 0ys - very dull !!
newcastle spurs ki le rha hai ? kitnay goal se ?
its quite clear that newcastle's plan is to double up on townsend why not switch flanks ?
fair to say newcastle are playing good . 
and tottenham is losing fasho !
a bloke in the stands clearly shooting " just giving smash him " everytime newcastle get the ball 
lambang tottenham menyerlah time game ni . if you know what i mean üòé
newcastle are looking good .
tottenham you fucking cunts haha .. newcastle 1-0
tottenham vs newcastle 
i'm 95% northern apparently so obviously have a mum for newcastle has rubbed off on me
we're tottenham hotspur , we forgot how to score !
are tottenham playing behind closed doors ?
newcastle's away kit looks like it's come off the sale rail at sports direct which is probably because it has !
westbrom , newcastle , manchester united
are tottenham fans gonna sing and get behind team ? orrrr ..
spurs-newcastle , chelsea-sutherland , arsenal-man united ... in football heaven <3 ' 
hold out newcastle
fouls ( 44 ' ) : spurs 2 - newcastle 9
all that money tottenham have spent
the newcastle keeper is being very kind to arsenal fans .... a case of being krul to be kind ! :-p 
spurs build up far too slow to trouble newcastle ... need to quicken the pace with which they move the ball ....
tottenham just can't get into this game
newcastle on something serious cutting tottenham apart like that
disgusting tottenham .
can't stand newcastle anymore but they've helped us out a bit lately
nice newcastle
this is shite tottenham
yes newcastle ! beating the yids
there aren't too many times i like seeing pardew and newcastle doing well . but today is one of those occasions - can't stand spurs .
newcastle impressive . spurs thus far look one-paced and devoid of any creativity and zip in the final third . lamela on at ht perhaps ?
newcastle are so different without the ' everyone give the ball to ben arfa ' tactic .
bit harsh making newcastle fans get to north london by midday on a sunday by the way - nice one sky
newcastle isn't even joking atm
spurs wake the fuck up man , so slow to do anything , newcastle deserve their lead , played very well this half
newcastle are good enough for top 6/7 finish . littered with french internationals . cb's are weak though .
quiet as fuck these tottenham fans
tottenham hotspur is suffering a defeat at home turf
super sunday @ slug .. spurs v newcastle @ 12 noon .. man city v sunderland @ 2 pm .. man united v arsenal @ 4 pm .. see you there !!
tottenham are useless . all these good players and they still trail to teams like newcastle . its europa league for them again .
newcastle lead at half time as i flounce out of my room for a break myself üòÉ
newcastle always getting three men out to townsend when he gets the ball , defensively are very organised .
wah damn sian donated $10 to singapore pools cos of this sucky performance from tottenham .
michael dawson was a newcastle fan as a kid . perhaps that's why he's terrible every time he plays against us ?!
what has happened to newcastle 
i did an extra minutes silence for that tottenham goalie
the football spurs play is honestly so tedious and hard to watch , nobody ever moves off the ball or runs beyond it 
tottenham's defence is clueless
tottenham should've saved themselves ¬£26 million and bought remy in on loan . 
the newcastle away strip is pretty nice
spurs haven't looked threatening newcastle defending well
newcastle united !!
come on tottenham üò•
go on newcastle !
tottenham are playing fucking shit
come on newcastle !! 
tottenham are poo atm
one pass forward two back from tottenham
when did watching tottenham become so boring ? no speed to their play , so pedestrian .
heard someone say that the spurs and newcastle kits are easy to confuse and that newcastle should be in their home kit ....
just turned on sky sports 1 ... are tottenham playing brazil üòï ?
went white hart lane last season and can honestly say tottenham is the biggest shithole ive ever step foot it .. bomb would tidy that gaff up
tottenham just can't score
i wanna be watching the game :( work sucks , but come on newcastle , 1-0
looks like the sunderland result was the kick up the arse that newcastle needed to get their season started ...
hahaha get in newcastle
newcastle are on a roll :')
newcastle did so well to get remy on loan , he has truly capped off their french side .
but how many seasons has ameobi played at newcastle yo

spurs v newcastle , nobody cares . moto gp , oh yeah ! lets play !! :))
47% - loic remy has scored 47% of newcastle's pl goals this season ; the highest proportion of any player in the top-flight . signing .
tot vs newcastle
if defoe comes on he will score against newcastle
tottenham spent over 100m and still aren't as good as arsenal
 newcastle vs tottenham
spurs are playing shockingly bad but newcastle are immense
newcastle dressed in a brazil like kit , theyre probably thinking " if we dress like brazil ... maybe we'll play like brazil " 
listening to the tottenham game on the radio whilst im on the bus ffs
i have a feeling the lack of goals may catch up with us today 
walked about 6 miles around newcastle and gateshead this morning . finally home . afternoon of warm , ufc , football , food and code
for the next 90 minutes i'm gonna be a newcastle fan ahaha hope they beat spurs !! but knowing them they will get a penalty
newcastle look solid
brazil is trending because of newcastle : l 
newcastle getting rewards for aggressive forechecking . chris hughton , look and learn #2pl
rock and roll tottenham ???? pleaaaaaasee .
tuning into the game . love the newcastle kits ! it's brazil ! sorry if i jinx the score .

so chelsea drew and if newcastle beat tottenham and we beat united .... it's looking sweet up thereüëå 
tottenham is no longer the hottest team in the pl ... arsenal can take that tittle back
tidying for this skype interview later while watching spurs v newcastle . busy day !
be such a good result if newcastle won this match
the difference is the midfield work-rates . newcastle's midfield are doing defensive work , spurs ' aren't .

i've never ever in my life enjoyed watching spurs less then i do at the moment !! boring boring tottenham !!
the win is still there if we want it . newcastle seem to want it more at the moment
newcastle giving their fans just what they deserve given the time they would have left for a 12 pm kick-off 200 miles from home
for gods sake = norwich city fc and = newcastle united fc . please newcastle fans i like you but try to use the right one
spurs say that the emirates is quiet yet all i can hear at white hart lane is the newcastle fans
norwich and west ham play better football than tottenham and chelsea loool all that money

tottenham fans don't like a sing song unless their team is winning eh ! 
newcastle better keep this formation 4-4-2
estou a ver tottenham contra newcastle

y dnt tottenham just put townsend left lennon right plenty of width then it opens it up for the other like eriksson n dembelle ect
newcastle to win and remy to score was decent odds ! 
newcastle on new years
definitely hoping spurs lose to newcastle today . pay back their opening games luck ...
too many passengers out there today , sigurdsson main culprit üò§lamela get warmed up son . 
why is tottenham hotspur playing mamelodi sundowns ?

tottenham head injury klaxon . take chiriches off immediately .
are spurs playing well ? or is just newcastle on top form atm ?
who scored for newcastle ?
newcastle doing it again !
tottenham too predictable ! go two up top ! 18
chiriches is pretty decent . tottenham have a good squad , when they gel , they'll be a problem .
tottenham look very cautious and reserved , especially for a side 1-0 down at home .
just woke up to see spurs are down at home to newcastle üòÆ
i hope spurs beat newcastle because i couldn't bear another pardew press conference where he pretends his total luck was careful planning
newcastle putting on a clinic .
tottenham are so boring to watch , 100+ mil and this is what you get .
brazilcastle asking all the questions , tottenham don't know the answers . walker looks like he dropped out of school early 
newcastle look decent again this week , look like brazil in their away strip ... pity they don't play like them ! ‚ò∫
at some point the possession in this game was spurs 70% newcastle 30%
losing at home to newcastle is fucking disgraceful . no excuses . pull up your socks boys and let's have a better 2nd half 
tottenham are so boring to watch now a days !!!
always love to see newcastle beating the yids , hahahhaha
approaching half time at white hart lane , newcastle lead 1 - 0 
nice gesture on remembrance sunday from tottenham to perform 45 minutes of silence , always going above and beyond .

port vale play with a higher tempo than this tottenham üí§üí§üí§üí§üí§üí§üí§
chas and dave tottenham

tottenham's coach seems to be less mouthy nowadays . is it because of his godfather , mourinho ?
newcastle are playing very very well ! on the other hand though krul has made some worldlie saves !
krul has kept newcastle ahead wth some fine saves ! 
for a 100million pound team spent on attackers tottenham are absolutely shite going forward
just left church heard tottenham are get whacked ! amen !! Óêï
how does it feel to be tottenham ..
genuinely thought this was going to be a straightforward spurs win . looks like an easy newcastle win going in at ht !
tottenham are losing at home , i'm watching friends and ross & rachel are breaking up ... everything is falling apart
spurs fans are very quiet and grumpy this morning . their team are playing crap too . newcastle parking the bus . zzzz
who do newcastle think they are having the same kit as brazil behave
well played newcastle ! hope they get remy on a permanent
well done newcastle ..
i'm surprised we haven't heard tottenham's one and only song they know yet ' there's only one ... (add player name ) there's only one .....'
tottenham are so shockingly bad it's making me sick .
another dreary half of football from tottenham ...
i'm all for newcastle win today but some of their players are wearing gloves . makes getting behind them slightly more difficult .
come on newcastle
buzzing if newcastle win this likeee
newcastle are really playing very well against tottenham . that win against chelshit last weekend has given them confidence .
no pace or movement from spurs . dembele has been shocking . newcastle pressing excellent and look a threat on the counter 
so , are spurs wank cos bale's gone , cos avb can't spend money , or both ??? 
anyone up ?! tottenham suckin rn .......... ‚Ä¶ .
tottenham fans are upset right now üòÇ
something told me to take tottenham out of my accums .
tottenham want goals but don't play defoe ? 
it's probably a good thing i'm not home to watch the tottenham match right now .
hold on newcastle !!
tottenham are ( sarcastic ) better than arsenal .
but newcastle wametuibia kit yetu
adebayor will break this tottenham bench one day ! 
i wish our most famous and historic clubs would stick with the team colours of which we know them best . etc .
tottenham need to get the finger out man
tottenham falling apart quickly‚òπ
tottenham has so many good players , just not a good team
watching newcastle is just like brazil , not because of the way they play , just the strip
come on newcastle give another goal
newcastle has the chance to save chelsea's blushes should they win tothenham . currently . 0-1 in favour of newcastle . 
really need too start performing ! haven't seen tottenham play well in ages !!! come on you spurs !!! 
* awaits tottenham boo boys at half time *
newcastle defending well . aggressive and getting very tight .
i hope tottenham end this march losing , just for manchester united's sake . 
tottenham are just a shit gareth bale .
tottenham are sick
 fans are getting frustrated at the pace that tottenham are playing at . have pressed them down far to easy in this first half .
 fans are getting frustrated at the pace that tottenham are playing at . have pressed them down far to easy in this first half .
e be like say this tottenham v newcastle match sweet o ! ... its all over moi tl ... hmmm
chiriches has a nosebleed . cue media shitstorm about irresponsible tottenham .
remember when tottenham spent 100m+ & all we heard was how great their squad was ?
" we're winning away , how shit must you be " newcastle fans .
newcastle win and arsenal win and this will be a great sunday ! 
half time : tottenham 0 - 1 newcastle 
yellow and blue newcastle strip is actually hideous ...
tottenham are struggling with goals but dont start defoe . wheres the logic in that ?
tottenham have won the league twice in their history . arsenal have won the league twice at white hart lane .
not looking good for spurs . as the push forward in the second half it will leave more space for the counter attacking forwards of newcastle .
why doesn't lamela get a game for tottenham ? surely must be worth a try has barely had a chance in the premier league so far 
tottenham without bale is like a hamburger without ham .
come on newcastle
come on tottenham ffs !
tottenham have been so frustrating to watch lately üòëüòë ugh get it together ! 
tottenham - newcastle üëå
newcastle playing decently
newcastle in yellow ?
tottenham fans know it was only a minutes silence before the game kicked off right ?
newcastle will never beat derby county
newcastle playing well deserve to be leading
really want to go to a chelsea vs tottenham game at home .
tottenham used to have lightning wingers attacking fast now we love to pass back and slow the game down .
another classic tottenham performance so far . all the possession , all the build up , and nothing to show for it .
second half , match them , 4-4-2 . we . are . at . home . to newcastle !
half time : tottenham 0 - 1 newcastle 
 ( tonight ) tottenham vs newcastle ( 8pm , live astro 810 ) sunderland vs man . city ( 10pm , live astro 812 ) swansea vs stoke city ( no live )
streaming'an tottenham vs newcastle :)
and tottenham are doing worse
tottenham are slacking 1-0 behind
sunderland 1 man city 3 , tottenham 2 newcastle1 , man united 3 arsenal 2 // just saying ?
i know there's tottenham fans in the stadium because i can see them !!
if tottenham are to win , they need to score two goals at least . something they've only managed to do 2/10 premier league games this season .
mad how in the 21 years , tottenham have only played champions league football once
recovering after a great but tiring show last night in brighton - uk tour dates continue next thurs/fri/sat in newcastle/glasgow/edinburgh ..
make newcastle try win tottenham today abeg
newcastle are dominating spurs
nice to see covs away kit bringing other teams success too 
need to change it at half time an come out stringer . passing needs to be quick we hold the ball to long an allow newcastle def time 
 last year before we thrashed tottenham 5-2 . 
newcastle must get nothing short of 3 points .
i hope tottenham ends this match losing , just for manchester united's sake . 
if newcastle win i might make them my second teamüòèüòÇüòÇ beat chelsea now beating spursüëç
townsend aside , tottenham are so boring to watch . zzzzz üò¥
1st half possession :d embele 70%-30% newcastle
newcastle getting the rewards for playing 2 up top here 442 üëç
come on newcastle
surely doesn't need till 60/70 minutes to get sig and dembele off . avb will probably wait till newcastle 6 up though
c'mon newcastle
since the start of last season french players have scored more goals for newcastle than they have at psg !! 31/26 .
i've seen rape victims more eager than the tottenham midfield 
:: ht tottenham 0-1 newcastle ... golll by loic remy 
 are such a crazy side . not just cause they're dressed as brazil
half way there newcastle !
tottenham terrible 2 watch . 1 average lookin striker signed frm a ¬£80m pot . is avb any improvement on harry ? must b under p if dnt make top4

hold on newcastle , just hold on
tottenham are so shit . they cant score without bale hahahaha 
first half newcastle masih leading .. cantek
newcastle showing a desire to win the ball that we need ! most of our possession is backwards & forwards between the back 6 
walk downstairs to see newcastle 1 -0 up ! 
come the end of season shakeup , loic remy may be a name considered among the signings of the season . invaluable goals for newcastle .
nice of tottenham fans to hold a 45mins silence .
first time i'm watching newcastle away . had no idea they wore the same away colours as we do . strange .
newcastle qui gagne a totth >>>>>>>>>
tottenham's play is too drab ... there's no flair whatsoever . they don't even play like a team
hope newcastle , united and sunderland win today , it's been a perfect weekend for football then üôè
shit , that tottenham player is bleeding sooo much from the nose .
up newcastle .... loic remy my man ! my namesake !.... we no g comot frm top4 dis week

n and an e and a wc a and s and tle un i t e d newcastle united fuck off
tottenham or having a shocking game , must be the fans fault
newcastle all over tottenham loool
pretty sad im not watching the newcastle game :(
if i was a man u fan id be so mad that an average newcastle have 2 players like cabaye & ben afra & they have likes of nani young anderson
tottenham lucky ameobi was offside then , they were cut apart by newcastle .
go to newcastle and meet lads from back home !!!
i am willing not to watch newcastle match as long as they keep playing and winning like now . come on lads . 
i woke up early to watch spurs v newcastle but spurs ' football is sending me back to sleep . 
newcastle doing us liverpool a favour , just hold onto the score now .
oh that's why newcastle is winning . their kits look like our away kits ! ;)
if play second half like they did against chelsea in the second half newcastle should gain 3 points comfortably . howay the lads !!!
tottenham losing 1 - 0 to newcastle lol
game is crying out for lamela . may as well take off paulinho , as he adds more to newcastle's attacking play than ours 
i hope tottenham and arsenal lose tonight .
 still don't convince me !! i don't think avb knows his best team or formation !! newcastle always look a threat going forward !!
how can a tottenham fan slate avb ?
newcastle united playing so well !!
newcastle united haven‚Äôt kept a clean sheet against spurs in their last 17 games .
 ( tonight ) tottenham vs newcastle ( 8pm , live astro 810 ) sunderland vs man . city ( 10pm , live astro 812 ) swansea vs stoke city ( no live )
i thought tottenham would do good even without gareth bale but now they're flopping quite hard . -_-
ameobi has played for 13 straight seasons at newcastle not counting his academy dats
newcastle outplaying the scum
tottenham don't look like a team at all
atmosphere at tottenham's dead , can't see then winning this
newcastle's leading . great .

half-time : tottenham hotspur 0-1 newcastle united 
what time do tottenham kick off ? are they the 2 o'clock game ?
half-time : tottenham hotspur 0-1 newcastle united 
good to us losing at home to newcastle with the millions we have spent :)
half-time : tottenham hotspur 0-1 newcastle united 
haven't felt like this about a tottenham team since we started challenging for top 4 !! avb is utterly clueless !!
damn i don't even know any spurs fan nor do i have any spurs followers . does tottenham hotspurs have any malawian fans ?
yes , nice one newcastle , what a lead .
newcastle united haven‚Äôt kept a clean sheet against spurs in their last 17 games .
ht . newcastle lead 0-1 . although spurs have seen more balls and forward moves they havent looked that dangerous whereas newcastle did
newcastle are fucking dirty
the only real bright spot for the spurs this season has been christian eriksen . still confused why he doesnt start every match 
come on tottenham ffs
i think newcastle should be changed to french castle 
 for all the people hating pardew and newcastle at the start of the season , there 4 points off 4th ! 
sometimes supporting tottenham flopspur is frustrating üò•
newcastle and arsenal away kits look too similar
if arsenal are an orchestra and dortmund are heavy metal , tottenham are robson & jerome
if tottenham lose too , this game will be so important .
ht tottenham 0-1 good performance by newcastle in their brazil-aping strip
deffo going newcastle in december , need to get away from this shitty area .
newcastle are by far the strangest club this year so far . one minute it's a crisis , the next they're amazing .
tottenham - newcastle --> sunderland - manchester city --> manchester utd - arsenal

if we can't beat newcastle at home we can say goodbye to champions league cause we won't be good enough to play in it .
tottenham very flat in the 1st half . i'm unsure whether the 4-2-3-1 formation works for them .
newcastle united have been good value for their lead but spurs would have scored but for tim krul .
ht spurs 0-1 newcastle . remy's early goal gives the toon the lead . spurs not out of 1st gear . soldado has hardly touched the ball .
newcastle lead now . 1-0 hotspurs
good first half from newcastle . competing well in the midfield , and dangerous going forward . krul proving he's one of the best . 
if you are just tuning in newcastle lead 1-0 which means spurs will need 2 penalty kicks in 2nd half to win
half time - spurs 0 - newcastle 1 ( remy )
imagine newcastle beat spurs and chelsea back to back . great results for them

good half of football . newcastle deserve the lead although krul has made some fantastic saves
had the sickest night in notts . done london . and notts , now manchester , newcastle , leicester and leeds by summer . but first ....
good first half from the toon boys ! 0-1 newcastle !! same again in the second half please !!!
impressed with the first half performance from newcastle so far
half time spurs 0 - newcastle 1
krul hasn't had a quiet day at the lane , but newcastle lead at half time
let's go newcastle !!
andros townsend says he is hoping to get on the scoresheet ahead of tottenham's game against newcastle : 
why are we struggling at home to newcastle ?
its tough for tottenham because they want to go wide , there should be variation to their game try coming through the middle .
anyone else thinks ameobi is the shittest player in this newcastle side ?
ht : good job newcastle 0 - 1 tot vs new
tottenham have been so fucking careless with the ball , no attacking threat either . games like this we need adebayor .
unusual from tottenham fans tbf !
newcastle kit is dirtyyy get it off 
go on newcastle
why is shola ameobi still playing for newcastle ?
ht : 0-1 deserved lead for newcastle at white hart lane through a terrific finish from loic remy . spurs looking very lax .
more of the same please newcastle :)
good first half by newcastle , deserve to be winning , and are making it hard for tottenham to create anything
half time : tottenham hotspur 0-1 newcastle united 
hold on newcastle 
really good half by newcastle there . gouffran excellent
lol just seen the newcastle score üòèüòè
tottenham are not a threat at all . and we talk about our lack of creativity .
strong half from newcastle that , look so much more dangerous with a quick forward going in behind on the break 
0-1 to newcastle at white hart lane . the half-time scoreline matched at 10.5 for ¬£4 whilst newcastle at ht matched at 7.4 for ¬£37
half time spurs 0-1 newcastle
is it just me or have newcastle made spurs look bang average ?
loic remy is the signing of the season so far by a long shot . he's become vital for newcastle must make that deal permanent pronto .
" when newcastle are in the mood they can beat anyone "
good first half from newcastle 1-0 at the break 
tottenham are looking a top half version of qpr .
but who's got remy anytime newcastle at 9s ... yep i got that ... long way to go tho ... + newcastle win in a few accas at 5s ... 
good half for newcastle spurs have been swag 
newcastle's resurgence tho .

half-time : spurs 0-1 newcastle united .
come on newcastle , you can do it . 
tottenham need time to gel , they'll have a much stronger second half to their season . especially if they buy one more striker in january .
since the start of last season , french players have scored more goals for newcastle united ( 31 ) than they have for psg ( 26) . [ richardajkeys ]
shit first half for us had a few good efforts but overall newcastle have dominated the first half !
credit to newcastle they have been a nightmare ! closing down quickly and physical as fuck 
tottenham play the worst football in the league , i'm nearly asleep .
has to be better tottenham 
pardew has his critics but when newcastle turn up they can be a handful for any team just when they are not they can be bloody awful !
great start for newcastle ! üòÉüëç 
hate to be negative but that was awful . newcastle bossing the game . .
how are newcastle winning this ?!
ht spurs 0 newcastle 1 remey 
seen newcastle a few time this season and they really aren't a bad side . decent blend in there and still players to back in . top 8 team
ameobi is a real weak link in that newcastle team . they're trying to break and it ends up with him , and then the chance is gone .
to be fair newcastle could have been 3-0 up . just waiting for a late penalty in the 2nd half .
and its ht . newcastle 1-0 spurs . hope this score will same until ft . 
good half newcastle

what are tottenham doing ???
the build-up play from newcastle has been a joy to watch at times . intricate , tidy , attacking passing football 
tinkering tottenham paying the price for the champo manager splurge by avb . settled side ? 
tottenham fans are shit
at the break !!........... newcastle leads an unknown club from london by a well taken goal from remy's stable
worst performance from tottenham in a while lack of tempo crowd dead and quiet not looking good
playing really well , hope we don't do a classic newcastle and just have one good half ! 
1-0 to us so far lets go newcastle :d 
half time : spurs 0-1 newcastle

newcastle are winning wooooooooo
tottenham arr being bullied . they're looking like the old arsenal right now .
half time : spurs 0-1 newcastle
su-perb newcastle . superb . 
is it not one-all at newcastle ? see , you are shite sp*rs . this tweet is admittedly premature . ht . 1-0 .
tottenham are one of those teams with so many good players but they're just incapable of playing amazingly for a full 90 minutes
i must say it is a splendid day to play away at tottenham
tottenham are a fucking embarrassment at the moment
loic remy with newcastle united's goal .
newcastle are actually good !
nothing makes me happier than when tottenham are losing :)
townsend and siggy both gone missing , dembele having a mare , shame we can only make 3 subs . easy for newcastle as it's far too pedestrian !!!
chiriches still receiving treatment at the end of 45 '. tim krul the star for newcastle , made a couple of stunning saves 
it's good to see newcastle united finally clicking , but ameobi ? really ?
tottenham need to sort it out ! this football is a joke !
so far its been an entertaining 1st half with being the better team . they lead 1-0 at white hart lane 
newcastle 1-0 up at the break . spurs yet to really get going
i love the abuse tottenham fans get for conveying their opinions/trolls .
newcastle looking very impressive , seem to have spurs in their pockets
newcastle are starting to look dangerously decent by their normal maverick standards .
spurs vs newcastle , great first half and remy what a player he is turning out for newcastle .
krul with 2 good saves to deny spurs ht : spurs 0-1 newcastle
c'mon newcastle , more of that in the next half please ! from , all city fans .
typical tottenham this season . slow build up , creates a couple good chances but no goals . cant believe weve conceded tho
remy has change the look of newcastle lately , better than our cuurent all strikers
perfect result so far vs 
newcastle lead 1-0 . played well . ripple of boos from spurs fans but generally been v supportive . avb can't blame them this time
what a shit half from tottenham hopefully they sort it out second half
beat chelsea last week .. beating tottenham this week . crazy ! 
half-time spurs 0-1 newcastle . loic remy‚Äôs 7th goal of the season gives the toon army the lead at the break .
avb looks slightly furious ... must love the avb game faces :p 
on the phone to sky tv . i think the signal is shit , tottenham seem to be playing in slow motion .. 
i doubt there are many teams better at giving the ball away in promising positions than newcastle . 1 up though . 
must be frustrating being a newcastle fan you just never know what kind of performance you are going to get from one game to the next
wish tottenham game had ice hockey rules get sandro on and have a fight with tiote we'll see who's hard then !
well that was a dull affair vs 
newcastle is leading ... yeah ...
ht : tottenham 0 - 1 newcastle united ( remy ' 13 )

keep it up newcastle
struggled badly when they got to the final third that half tottenham . it wasn't ' patient build up ' either , just no idea 
good service in newcastle . a proud day today , appreciate everyone who came and showed support .

come on you newcastle ! * karbitbentar
tottenham hotspur being made look like an average side today by newcastle . no creativity and tempo to the play at all . .
tons of near misses . needing 2-goals for 3pts . where have seen this tottenham before ? yikes . 
ht : 0-1 newcastle . not bad but not great either , we've tested the away ' keeper a few times , but we still lack fluidity . 
one of the best first halfs i've ever watched as a newcastle fan . 
the table is begining to show itself 
if remy could get his head around the offside rule , newcastle would be out of sight by now . i'll take 0-1 at the half though .
could almost script this game . either defoe will come on and score for the draw or tottenham will get a penalty late on . 
always like to see newcastle doing well . but then i remember , mike ashley .
stan collymore just said tottenham should take a leave out of arsenal's book 
it's just like watching 
spurs won't win . we don't score more than 1 in a premier league game and newcastle already have their goal
spurs vs newcastle is boring . time to watch lorenzo kick marquez's ass in .
tottenham need to wake up ! always letting my bets down !
come on newcastle !!!

fucking fell asleep , to wake up and find that i missed 44 mins of the spurs vs newcastle game :( but remyyyyyyyyy 1-0
i'm loving what newcastle are doing this season
newcastle need at least 2 more to win . penalties and late goals have become the norm with spurs .
remarkable recent newcastle turnaround from collapse vs everton several weeks ago . credit to pardew . 
tottenham are without a shadow of doubt the most boring team to watch in england .
what a rubbish 45 from slop spurs though newcastle keeper has made 3 great saves , maybe thats part of the rubbish
ht : tottenham 0-1 newcastle . remy with the goal , took it round friedel and put it into the empty net . deserved lead as well . 
for all the money they've spent , tottenham are poor .
newcastle need to hold this result , which will make it better for to climb the table with a win today ‚ô•
come on newcastle
if newcastle win i will be so happy
tottenham are putting me to sleep
outplayed tottenham first half . keep it going boys ! kill em off . 0 1
how are newcastle in the mood .. they did not even get out of first gear ... we were truly awful .. cannot defend avb or players ..
newcastle united is doing a lot of favour for us in recent weeks ! haha , keep it up . 
newcastle wanna fuck up tottenham too ?
at newcastle airport with my first beer , let the holidays commence
first half analysis - newcastle were on top form ! 
tottenham cant seem to score if our their life depended on it 
so far so good . hopefully newcastle can keep this going and do us a bit of a favour . 
newcastle winning wtf
watching tottenham is painfully boring
tottenham need a goal before the 60 minute mark .
well the great avb is being out done by alan pardew . for fuck sake attack them . newcastle deserved that lead . with there good tempo with we
tottenham are very average
it's the tottenham way ; why anyone thinks it would be any different is beyond me
indicative of spurs season . newcastle caught offside several times . spurs not once . not making runs to the goal .
so i stick on a sky and see newcastle beating tottenham at home 
dont know whether this is newcastle or brazil ! brilliant first half display , hope we keep it up second half ! 
paulinho hasn't performed for tottenham so far his been shit
great first half from newcastle , fully deserve the half time lead . finally shown some real passion and urgency from the first whistle .
ray winston you mug 11/2 sodaldo next goal scorer so not cool üò¥üò¥üò¥ 
newcastle playing well ? not really , not that they have to
wake up to see spurs losing 1-0 to newcastle
this is not the tottenham i used to know . dembele sluggishh needs to come off for the beast . lamela and defoe on .
cummon newcastle please win !!!!!! and sunderland do us a fav and i'll be very happy
half-time at white hart lane . newcastle 1 tottenham 0 .
with all these french players newcastle ikipatana na lyon inakuwa derby ..
spurs defence looks out of sorts everytime newcastle r in the final third ..
i reckon avb will try to play two wingers on opposite sides cutting in in the second half . take newcastle by surprise . 
can someone please tell townsend that he is allowed to take it past the newcastle lb . cheers 
newcastle newcastle newcastle
few efforts from spurs but other than that there been pretty poor newcastle deserve the lead
newcastle united looking to play through our high defensive line and with dawson slow in pace i expect a . v-b to tweak that .
if remy doesnt permanently join newcastle then he's mentally ill
newcastle hold a well earned lead at half-time in the midday kick-off . spurs trailing 0-1 at home . spurs 5/2 newcastle 11/10 draw 11/5
newcastle could win this game 6-0 and the media would just talk about spurs .
since the start of last season , french players have scored more goals for newcastle ( 31 ) than they have for paris st. germain ( 26) . madness .
 none of newcastle's goal in 2013 have been scored by an englishman .. if u didnt know 
very impressed with newcastle first half . they should probably get pardew to sign a longer term contract so they don't lose him ...
when newcastle are in the mood they can beat anybody when we are in the mood we can lose to anybody ... awful 1st half need a better 2nd 
good value , are newcastle united , for their lead .
take nothing away from newcastle though . they've been good .
half time score : tottenham 0-1 newcastle . 
tottenham 0-1 newcastle love that . ht
newcastle 1 goal up ... interestin ' baba god put my enemies to shame pls . 
great first half from the toon . 7 in 7 for loic remy and we lead away against tottenham . hold on geordies !!. 
don't want to go back to newcastle at all :(
i just hope newcastle can convince cabaye to stay until the summer at least . if any high finish is on offer he needs to be here 
ht : spurs 0-1 n'castle loic remy scores his 7th epl goal of the season to put newcastle ahead .
wonder how tottenham will respond to the second half ? however they do i hope newcastle can hold on to their lead and win the game ! 
half-time betting : 13/5 tottenham ( 0) , 11/5 draw , 11/10 newcastle ( 1) . 
new pb today at heaton harriers memorial 10k in newcastle . 46.51 . training paying off . 
newcastle united have won six away games at in the barclays premier league , they have only won more at villa park ( 8 ) 
if tottenham and arsenal lost , that would make my day
even if we beat newcastle 4-1 , and newcastle had two players send off ! ppl would still moan !. 
newcastle are beating spurs !? at white hart lane !? wow !
loool wait tottenham are losing üòÇ
so newcastle lead 0-1 at ht .
go on newcastle !
all tottenham's 5 league games on sky this season , have been under 2.5 goals . 23 yellow cards & 1 red shown in last 4 , cards will come .
lack ideas , some poor performances on the pitch . newcastle deserve to be 1up
come on newcastle hold it down
half-time spurs 0-1 newcastle . loic remy‚Äôs 7th goal of the season separates the sides after 45 minutes . come on newcastle ! "
how does it feel to be tottenham how does it fell to be smallllll you sold gareth bale we signed mesut ozilll mesut ozilllllllllllll üòÇüòÇüòÇüòâ
newcastle shouldn't dream , they won't beat spurs in their home
newcastle have got one of the slowest right backs in the prem so avb plays sigurdsson instead of lennon or lamela ... wtf !
soldado is 11/2 to score next . the better bet would be professor stephen hawking at 4/1 . 
what newcastle can do to trouble the spurs back 4 even more is bring on ben arfa . more through balls , more chances .
 update : half time 0 - 1 
being a tottenham fan is getting harder every week 
newcastle dressed like brazil and playing like brazil ( sort of ) 
why are tottenham so shit ? we play the worst football in the premier league & avb still can't get out team right kmt were getting relegated
where has my tottenham gone ? please come back soon 
tottenham are just , terrible
spurs better beat newcastle !
we are awful today , any team that can make newcastle look good has to be . 
what are the chances of tottenham and mancity losing and man u winning ??
really don't see how soldado is worth ¬£26m . i would argue half that is too much . yet the media's love of tottenham spares him criticism
newcastle have spurs all over , keep it up newcastle 
spurs are far too predictable , ht : spurs 0-1 newcastle . ( remy )
dear we are tottenham , at home we play 4-4-2 with wingers and crosses into the box . you win matches by scoring goals . yours disgruntled
ht at white hart lane , ahead wit a lone goal 
evies trying to make me a newcastle fan ... like what even is football hahaha 
tottenham tho
newcastle's remy has scored the 7th goal of the season
fair play to newcastle , you can't fault them at all , spurs are shite mind but credit where credits due
hope newcastle hold on .
following in the e.p.l they are playing well away from home against faves tottenham making spurs looking like a team lacking life
good game newcastle and tottenham .. but how out of place is ameobi 
tottenham are great until they reach the box ... then they spasm and can't kick a ball .
half time , toiletham hotspur 0 newcastle 1
ht at white hart lane , and it's tottenham 0 - 1 newcastle , remy with the goal . can spurs bounce back ? 
hope newcastle smash spurs
the good newcastle turned up first half ... hope we keep it gan !
being a newcastle fan must be the most frustratin thing ever , 1 game class 1 game shite 
that was an excellent first half for newcastle . remy puts then in the front . it's 0-1 at whl .
it's most likely spurs will want to throw everything at newcastle in the 2nd half and can be caught out on the counter
if newcastle play cisse alongside remy instead of ameobi , they'd probably bagged a couple more goals by now
tottenham need to sort them self out second halfüò°‚öΩÔ∏è
really impressed with newcastle , i must say . moving the ball beautifully . wouldn't be so easy if sandro was playing , mind 
so many players need subbing . dembele and paulinho just going through the motions and getting bossed by newcastle .
hold on newcastle
hate the mancs , almost on par with tottenham for me .. and we fucking owe them one today !
mean while in rongai ,, spurs 0 newcastle 1

spurs vs newcastle es bien .
omg tottenham is playing badly .. need some creativity man !
tottenham fans impeccibly observing 45 minutes rememberance of gareth bale . what they would do to have him on the pitch right now ...
newcastle look a frightening team when playing with a genuine target man like ameobi upfront . allows remy to sneak into the box unnoticed .
" and its newcastle who lead at the break ", said the glum , dispirited , subdued , desolate southern cunt of a commentator
newcastle united looking and playing like brazil !! 
ht at white hart lane . newcastle value for 1-0 lead . remy sharp all half . spurs sluggish but did force krul into 2 world class saves 
barclays premier league - ht score : tottenham hotspur 0 - 1 newcastle united .
worst half of football i've ever seen tottenham play
disappointing first half from spurs need more grit . newcastle are dirty bastards
get in newcastle , please win this .
tottenham can barely score 1 goal usually a penalty , so how are they gonna score 2 without conceding any . not possible .
newcastle to win the league ????
i've always said friedel is wank and it's showing ! the back 4 clearly have no confidence in him n it's letting newcastle control this game !
newcastle

tottenham hotspur 1-0 newcastle united @ half " newcastle leads at white hart lane at the half ." i like the sound of that ÓÅó 
half-time : tottenham 0-1 newcastle ( loic remy) .
none of the 33 premier league goals newcastle have scored in 2013 have been by an englishman . 
didn't they say newcastle have conceded 11 more goals than us and we can't score against them
tottenham are actually boring . whl is too quiet and newcastle's kit is the shut version of ours . 
newcastle should be more than 1-0 up !
spurs look nervous today , only one who you can see creating anything for them is eriksen on the other hand newcastle look tactically better .
newcastle really been helping arsenal out recently . draw with liverpool , beat chelsea and now beating tottenham 
tottenham fans are absolutely minging
if we play like this against newcastle how are we gonna play against united & cityüòÇ
go newcastle
good job newcastle üëç

newcastle are this season's up and coming underdogs
why are arsenal fans talking . the outcome of today's game don't affect too much since chelsea drew today and tottenham are losing .
newcastle united playing well on the counter and with tempo , which is something spurs aren't playing with : tempo .
half-time : tottenham 0-1 newcastle ( remy 13) . much to ponder for the hosts as confident visitors go in good value for their lead .
i trust my team newcastle .
none of the 33 premier league goals newcastle have scored in 2013 have been by an englishman - things like this really piss me offüòû
hey tottenham hotspurs , don't you miss bale ? hahahaha .
both proven in the premier league . the only thing is that newcastle would extort us for them .
yes newcastleüòÇüò±üôå
i'm cool supporting newcastle and sunderland for an afternoon , but united hell to the fuck no !!!
come on newcastle keep this up
and against a team as shit as newcastle as well . at home . fucking disgrace . look at pool and arse this season . kicked on . not us .
we've gotta turn it around in the second half . we can't be losing to relegation battle teams like newcastle
newcastle win would be good
 half-time : spurs 0-1 newcastle
only premier league club i hate more than tottenham is united . ?
newcastle is my second fav team in the epl bruh
2 1 newcastle on nufc
if i was tottenham i would of invested in younger players who are all 17/18 and get them into the first team
newcastle don't want to come out slacking in the second half just because they are winning at half time
come on newcastle
newcastle playing with a deep back line ... looks like we've been found out yet again .
tottenham need to get the finger oot
spurs always dodgy against newcastle . why can't we score .
newcastle have done their homework it seems . looking to get ball off us in the middle/final 3rd and hit on the break very quickly
ht : newcastle 1-0 spu*s ! no penalty , no spu*s ! hahaha
half-time spurs 0-1 newcastle . loic remy‚Äôs 7th goal of the season separates the sides after 45 minutes . can the hosts pull it back ? "
tottenham v newcastle disallowed goal-spurs use a high line to catch newcastle off-guard . cabaye passes to ameobi , who rounds friedel score .
yes newcastle ... love you at the moment , beat chelsea and now beating spurs ! only bad thing is you drew with us aha ! üëç‚öΩÔ∏è
boring boring tottenham . so fucking predictable . every player takes around 10 touches before passing .
goowaaan newcastle
defoe gets in to the tottenham history books for scoring goals and avb plays soldado who is is crap ans cannot score . what a manager
newcastle deservedly ahead . spurs need to up the tempo . not the best 1/2 i've ever seen . 
newcastle playing brilliant against tottenham , winning 1-0 at half time .
bring back aspects of the old exciting tottenham to attack and keep the defence sturdy , townsend on the left to open it up a bit
omg yes newcastle
used to feel so blessed as a tottenham fan with the exciting football we play ! now it's so slow it's pretty much anti-football ! 
spurs vs newcastle
tottenham are such a frustrating team to watch arghüò©üò§üî´
half time . totthenham hotspur 0 - 1 newcastle united
newcastle took 4 of their 5 shots inside the box , tottenham took just 3 of their 10 shots from inside the box .
go on newcastle lool
tottenham must have one of the worst sets of fans in the prem/europe . 
tottenham looking below average today
ht : roic remy 1-0 gareth bale fc !! tottenham without bale is like cell phone without service . a cell phone without service is to play game
a great finish from remy & two top saves from krul give newcastle the advantage at white hart lane 
tottenham 0 1 newcastle remy !!! ht
how does it feel to be tottenham , how does it feel to be small , you sold bale , we signed mesut ozil , mesut ozil , mesut ozil ! 
epl - ht : spurs 0-1 ( loic remy 13 ) newcastle
 isn't hard to beat at home . aston villa proved it , might just compound this as well . time will tell .
tottenham hotspur 0 newcastle united 1 half time
tottenham are such an overrated team , newcastle and the losing 3-0 at home to west ham . soldado has 1 goal from open play in league
great that newcastle has taken the lead
newcastle haven't had to even step out of gear . if avb had balls he'd put sandro , lamela and lennon on for dembele , sigs & townsend .
need to up the tempo . so slow when we have the ball and letting newcastle have so much time and space when we haven't got the ball 
newcastle playing some extraordinary soccer ball here
best thing about havin 4g is that my internet works when im at tottenham now . means i ain't gotta watch this pile of shit .
spurs not playing particularly well . credit to newcastle who have kept the likes of townsend very quiet . ht 0-1 ( remy )
that was poor , avb shape up you cunt , tottenham have played shit , have we even woke up 
tottenham should attack more on the left as well as the right bozza
tottenham have won the league twice in their history . arsenal have won the league twice at white hart lane . loool
ruud gullit on al jazeera - surprised remy went to newcastle , he could of went to a better club .
newcastle to get hammered second half ? surely we can't beat chelsea and tottenham . can we ?
half-time spurs 0-1 newcastle . loic remy‚Äôs 7th goal of the season separates the sides after 45 minutes . 
absolutely no chance of seeing remy in hoops again ! only came to us to be put in shop window , which he's done very well at newcastle .
remy ney ish , haih , urmmm spurs 0-1 newcastle
 oh harry where are you this tottenham coach's tactics are so negative !!!!
superb first half from brazil there .. sorry newcastle
half time at the lane . avb's got a tough team talk to give . newcastle are comfortable - especially with krul between the sticks 
we are so predictable . at no time has one of our midfield run in beyond soldado . far too easy for newcastle to defend .
newcastle are fucking smashing it
tottenham hotspur - driving fans to drink since 1882 ...... 
c'mon newcastle !
cabaye and remy pulling the strings for newcastle
half-time spurs 0-1 newcastle . loic remy‚Äôs 7th goal of the season separates the sides after 45 minutes . 
newcastle have played some good football though .
don't understand why tottenham don't play defoe up front with soldado . such a good goalscorer
newcastle look class today
much like the demba ba & papiss cisse partnership that was so effective for newcastle .
come on newcastle !!! caught the game late but great goal by remy .
that was 45 mins of my life i won't get back . buck up tottenham
guna bet on tottenham to win more often if this is what happens :) 
newcastle about to make me happy for the second weekend in a row ! come on you geordies ! 
 seem to be coming back in form . 
newcastle can challenge for title if cisse gets his powers back
tottenham played better b4 the ¬£100m+ spend . avb is on a ticking bomb . he probably needs to get off his high horse & bring adebayor back .
dominate everton first half , get ripped apart by newcastle first half
pathetic , both from the players and the tottenham fans . need to turn the game around 
hate to say this but thanks to newcastle for getting a goal now against tottenham
newcastle and utd to win and it will have been a very good weekend for 
massive day of football at the club today ! spurs v newcastle under way then sunderland v city at 2.05 pm then the big one !! united vs arsenal
tottenham losing . c'mon newcastle !
tottenham are so boring to watch . they play the deadest football
what were newcastle thinking with this away kit .
question : how many dodgy free kicks is the ref going to award ? answer : as many as it takes . 
hold on tight and finish this game newcastle . chickens aren't worthy enough for 3 points .
where did newcastle get this kind of form they are in from ? football i tell u
credit where credit is due , pardew is doing a great job at newcastle this season with all the backroom shenanigans going on .
also helps that newcastle have one of those goalkeepers who can pull off amazing saves .
come on newcastle ! want spurs , man city and arsenal to lose today ! 
" how does it feel it to be small ? how does it feel to be tottenham ? you sold bale , we signed mesut ozil " üé∂üé∂üé∂üé∂üé∂üé∂
impressed by newcastle in that half . they really do have some quality in the middle and up front .
really , really not impressed with tottenham . zero width and soldado needs to stay high ... spurs pissing me off now !
come on newcastle !
come on newcastle !!!
that is why we won't get champions league were getting dicked on by newcastle
just finished football training to find sp*rs 1-0 down to newcastle ... 
newcastle are passing the ball well today !
loic remy reminds me of henry . newcastle doing well so far . spurs lack the finishing touch
come on newcastle hang on lads !
go on newcastle keep it up
come on newcastle 
in the last 8 years , tottenham have won more trophies than arsenal . just for the record so that we don't tweet ignorance here 
newcastle " city " fc must be playing again , because my timeline is full of tweets when they mean 
its not like tottenham are playing shit ... we've created so many chances 
not much to say about the first half , very very poor tottenham
hold on newcastle , you can do it !
come on newcastle
totally lacklustre performance . by v in first half . tottenham , you need a decent strike force . let's see what happens next .
epl ( tonight ) tottenham vs newcastle ( 8pm , live astro 810 ) sunderland vs man . city ( 10pm , live astro 812 ) swansea vs stoke city ( no live )
so fucked me and my brother used to fight proper fists over simple football . i would fight anyone after tottenham lose to arsenal bmt .
tottenham have a lot of good players . but they aren't much of a team imo .
common newcastle you beauty's
newcastle 1-0 good half of football that
half time at white hart lane , its tottenham 0 newcastle 1 . newcastle have looked solid and compact so far 
i hope newcastle can hold on to their lead , better still score one or two more ..
come on newcastle united game on
why are tottenham on the tv , it's not thursday night ?
we all played shit today and so are tottenham ..
tottenham are actually boring . whl is too quiet and newcastle's kit is the shit version of ours . 
losing to newcastle at home we are shit .
a wudda have da had spurs backed ffs !!! looked and looked at newcastle to , 5/1 they were lol !!!! 
hope newcastle win , can't stand tottenham !
if you tell andros townsend to start passing and crossing instead of shooting every 20 seconds , then tottenham may score more . 
ht tottenham 0-1 newcastle possesion : 64.6 % - 35.4 % attempts : 10 - 5 shots : 10(4 on target ) - 5(3 on target ) 
newcastle were 5/1 to win this morning , have a little guess what i did .
if newcastle beat the yids and arsenal beat manu that will make my day !!!
so far so good for my wish list !! newcastle win , sunderland win , arsenal draw .. üëå
newcastle to keep a clean sheet for the next 45 at 2/1 . what we thinkin ?
ht : spurs 0 - 1 newcastle , well ! come on spurs ¬†
newcastle : only win games when its important for the other team to win
same ol ' situation , newcastle can now sit back most of the second half and skin us on the break , this won't get any better 
vexed newcastle are winning
even fight young spray after a tottenham loss to arsenal the passion is real .
newcastle winning !
poor first half display from tottenham , lacking a finishing touch as always , if they had that touch , they could be top of the league
so i see newcastle scored ??!!!! lol 
loic remy 1-0 tottenham
newcastle played really well . i think it's slipping out ttfc's hand .
newcastle's gameplan plays to spurs weaknesses , avb needs to change tactics not necessarily personnel as newcastle have this in the bag atm
come on newcastle !
newcastle ... i think i trust those guys .. sunderland can still keep their home record against man . city .. 
newcastle lead 1-0 at half time . decent defending . but white hart lane ain't easy
if newcastle win we jump to 6th ? nice
the better team were clearly newcastle . spurs are poor in attacking .
krul has been solid this far for ... where is anyway ? 
tottenham can't escape newcastle thrashing
lioc remy scored 47% of newcastle's goals this season more than any other player in the .. what a striker !!
would lay newcastle if i were still a betfair man
hold on for second half pls newcastle

nothing is more frustrating than being a tottenham supporter
tottenham u can't do this to me .
where the hell do newcastle get off making their away kit brazil colours ?
cheers newcastle 
newcastle looking organized
tottenham losing ... brilliant .
newcastle have made such a turnaround since losing to sunderland
mousa dembele has fallen off a cliff this season - pretty sure he hasn't completed a pass in the newcastle half . next to useless .
the last season was red hot , this multi-million new spurs team is simply horrible . they lost their identity totally 
newcastle do actually look quite good this season ! still fancy norwich to grab their second away win of the season tho !
brazil vs tottenham
newcastle are getting so good all of a sudden üòß
it appears to be incredibly easy to set up against this tottenham side . they play such a high line but always give the ball away in midfield
dad enjoys football by himself but comes to life with us all watching together . he becomes a funny pundit especially with newcastle 1 up !
newcastle to win , city to win , arsenal to win 
no englishmen have scored for newcastle this season blah , blah , blah . however : paul dummett : place of birth newcastle upon tyne , england .
paulinho and chiriches are at fault for newcastle's goal
newcastle have played the ball in between our cb and fb 4/5 times due to their width , avb needs to take note !!
ok why is my dad in newcastle
why'd the spurs game kick off at 12 ? ridiculously unfair on the newcastle fans
ever since newcastle scored the spurs fans have just moaned and groaned with the odd ' oh when the spurs ' 
good goal by newcastle tbh
i reckon someone should come to newcastle n give me a back massage bcos i have a lot of knots in my back atm n they hurt
would newcastle win at spurs ? that will be a disaster ... but i must say i would be happy ... as one of top 4 contender gos down on a drain ynwa
fans have the right to boo this shit , we are tottenham , we play fast attacking football not slow bore you to tears football
tottenham are doing my bet over already üôà
newcastle actually need to buy remy ! ‚öΩÔ∏è
newcastle's away jersey is horrible ... are they tryin to be brazil ? :p but they're beating spurs so who cares !

respect to the tottenham fans who have been silent for 45 minutes in honour of remembrance sunday .
tottenham are 100% not getting a top 4 finish
newcastle and tottenham players are wearing poppies on their jerseys which i know is for remberence , does anyone know whom or what it's for .
newcastle's kit looks class today
come on newcastle 
remy's class , could be the difference maker for newcastle this season
it's as though the newcastle players are running on batteries
spurs have been poor in the first half , newcastle have been impressive so far
not a bad performance so far by newcastle but still 45 minutes to play . if we play like we did in the first half we will win
remy is wasted at newcastle , easily could start for any of the big 4
know what depressing ? after we lose to newcastle , arsenal are gonna beat man utd . then we'll lose to city & united ( y )
tottenham v newcastle half time - tottenham 0-1 newcastle

jamie redknapp on the newcastle goal : ' remy is key to it '.

dave from newcastle ecstatic with 1st half . not cos they lead 1-0 but because ameobi started . only way its better , bring on the other one ! >
a)newcastle are winning !
newcastle played really well in the first half , deserve to be ahead
newcastle have shown in some games they can match or beat the best in the e.p.l last w/k & this w/k they have showed skill and talent 
tottenham have looked average all season ! money well spent ....
newcastle were 11-2 to win today ....
spurs too slow , losing possession in midfield , little creativity , newcastle pressing well . need a spark and some pace 
life's good today . finish season1 , haotian and chunzhen reconciled , got my visa card , spurs losing to newcastle currently
tottenham have no striker .. only penalty converters ..
this is the newcastle i've been waiting for !!
its newcastle not noocarsul
have to admit that newcastle plays better atm .
it's just like watching brazil .... well newcastle are wearing a similar kit anyway .

the better team's leading , to be honest . tottenham can do so much better . 
newcastle had a good half
to be honest , i think that the game could go on and end 2-1 to newcastle in the end after goals in the second half . 0-1 
tottenham look worrying bad so far . something has to change i fear
come on spurs . we've got the players , we're at home & newcastle are crap . let's attack !! #4 -1fulltime
0-1 at tottenham . north london is ..... yellow !
i wish sky would employ people who can pronounce the name of our team , newcastle not 
newcastle is winning !
hugo lloris is tottenham's best player . just seen remy's goal and that was predictable . avb loves that high line .
barclays premier league | half time 0 - 1 ( 13 ' remy ) 
come on tottenham , i love you but you're killing me here
howay newcastle see this game out üëåüëç
yes jamie carragher , let's look at newcastle's goal from newcastle's point of view 
have confidence newcastle have 3 men against townsend 3 fucking 3
spurs have scored 23 goals in their last 24 home games against newcastle ?.. that's not impressive in the slightest
you're welcome again newcastle 
go orn newcastle
tottenham 0-1 newcastle "
come on newcastle !!
what's happened to the " too many french speaking players at newcastle " moaners ? obvs back in their holes ! 
i can't believe spurs man how can you spend all that cash and fail to score against newcastle üòÇüòÇüòÇ
a ) what the fuck would you know - you're an arsenal fan , not newcastle b ) what's with this ' next level ' bollocks you pretentious cockend ?
watching how newcastle defend from the front and the energy epitomises everything we r not - a real shame . 
tottenham are losing and i had to have a black tea üòÅ worst break ever .
boring boring tottenham ... 
tottenham seems one of the toughest title challenger . with a new quality players . but mcm kelakar je beli player hebat , tp .
you can't do what paulinho done in the build up for the newcastle goal , it's not acceptable . i can only describe it as limp .
newcastle executing ' the attacking press ' perfectly for the goal 
still 1-0 to newcastle ?
if tottenham lose i'll be angry
spurs are 0-1 behind against newcastle . whl isn't the fort it was last year , tim krul had some great saves first half . andre in trouble .
so infuriated with tottenham
i'f tottenham lose and arsenal lose it'll be great ! don't see city losing but that would be a bonus :d
poor half from spurs ! newcastle deservedly lead !
woohoo !! go newcastle !
harry's last season , we finished 4th and we bought saha and nelsen but we beat newcastle at home 5-0 . liverpool 4-0 etc etc
hugo lloris has been the difference for this tottenham side this season . 
newcastle doing a great job on townsend . this is where he can prove he is class .
newcastle still odds against to win and to be honest they look good value at 6/5
still in bed cba to watch newcastle but i bet the game is poppin
i dont even support tottenham anymore . i support real madrid .
half-time spurs 0-1 newcastle . ( goal by : loic remy )
newcastle need to do there beat to hold on to remy . mike ashley needs to pull the finger out and sign him
wish remy wasn't doing so well at newcastle , if we get promoted we have to keep him 
newcastle cud'v ad two other goals but just offside !
avb messed up tottenham hotspurs smh
remy scored the the 1st goal for newcastle united
haha . spurs are losing . well done newcastle ! 
tottenham and stoke is the most boring teams in the league ! without any doubt ! 
newcastle are doing durt
this tottenham is awful .
tottenham fans .... where are ya !!!! 4yourehavingalaugh

pretty poor from tottenham in that first half
yeah blame the keeper and not giving the ball back to newcastle about 3 times . 
but fair play to newcastle
half time : spurs 0-1 newcastle . remy's goal gives the toon the lead . 's great form continues !
a newcastle and arsenal victory would be sweet !
tottenham are on a negative spiral

newcastle win , sunderland win , arsenal win . this will bring me happiness today .
krio is newcastle's best player !

tottenham vs newcastle until manchester united vs arsenal
jamie carragher is absolutely massacring the newcastle players ' names 
newcastle 1-0
newcastle are the thorn in my accumulator . everything else is a banker , but they are doing alright at the moment . questions is for how long ?
good going newcastle lets keep this up !! lets get , back to back victories ... against " supposedly " bigger clubs !! 
of course krul would have the best performance of his life the day i bet on newcastle to lose
tottenham will win with 2 penalties
descanso en white hart lane , gana el newcastle united por 0-1 ante el tottenham . manda el gol de remy , el nuevo henry 
game isn't over yet folks still another 45mins knowing newcastle they'll not turn up 2nd half
i am so proud of you all , fell of my seat when goal went in . we may be toon army , but we are great newcastle . again tim up & up away . go go go
this is a must win ! gotta get two early goals i dnt care if its newcastle nd the keepers having a worldy we must win at least 2goals !
hold on newcastle
goodbye newcastle and your poopy weather !!
un bon tottehnam - newcastle en attendant le big match de ce soir ... loic remy le new thiery henry
people saying nufc only in front because of krul . his job is to prevent goals conceded . it's working . newcastle deserve the lead . done
if newcastle win thats what tottenham get for always scoring pens
smh 4 tottenham !
pardew always looks a little surprised ( in the wrong way ) whenever newcastle score .
don't think we deserve to be losing . newcastle barely created anything . we could have had 3 were it not for krul . sandro , lennon & lamela .
pub grub and a few drinks this afternoon , newcastle win & sunderland upset would be perfect . 
although we all know spurs - newcastle is the big one today . the best team ever against the biggest club in the world .
add the runs from newcastle attack and the through balls from their midfield to our team and we'd have the perfect team . imagine it . üëÄüëäüí¶
ht :. tottenham 0-1 newcastle , we had a couple of clear cut chances but the firing power is absent .

townsend ruins tottenham , too direct for them when they dont play counter attack football . he's clueless with build up play
carragher referring to paulinho challenge in build-up to newcastle goal .... " oh jesus ". sums it up !!! 
comon newcastle
spurs are terrible to watch , hope newcastle hold on
toon toon black & white army ... love watching newcastle ! üòòüòç
tottenham hotspur .................. i need x
just cba with newcastle being decent 
wake up tottenham !!!!!
newcastle are so much more threating then us wish we brought remy
tottenham are so boring to watch
tell me how it feels to be tottenham , tell me how it feels to be small ! you sold bale , we signed mesut ozil , mesut ozil , mesut ozil !
newcastle have been helping arsenal a lot in the last couple of weeks 
hopefully newcastle hang on to beat the tottenham scum !!
no idea how defoe sits on the bench every week when tottenham need goals , so underrated
risky single of tottenham to score before the 70th min . odds : 2.20 
well redknapp sums it up for me newcastle's goalkeeper biggest problem in that half was the sun . wake up spurs
think spurs will win this . newcastle are a 45 minute side
sitting in tunisia 25degrees sipping red wine and newcastle winning 1-0 at half time can't get much better !
newcastle 1-0 up at half time playing away . this is wierd
 ht : tottenham hotspur 0 - 1 newcastle united . come on you spurs
hope arsenal turn united over today and newcastle don't through this away .
we all know newcastle will get beat 2-1 they always do dont they ??
come on newcastle ! 
ameobi has been awful ; newcastle managing to get the lead in spite of him . 
krul making some good saves for newcastle but spurs just look lost up front , literally no idea how to break teams down in the final third .
who even supports newcastle ?
shall be a newcastle fan for today !
hope newcastle hold onto this
it's half time in north london and it's tottenham 0-1 newcastle , hopfully newcastle can win so we can secure a second successive win 
can we say tottenham are missing gareth bale as they are trailing by one goal to nil at white hart lane common i expect townsend to do wonda
if newcastle were a stock , in fpl terms they would moving into the ' buy ' category ! whereas spurs attack would be ' sell ' ! 
tottenham is trap music = trash rap !
since the start of last season , french players have scored more goals for newcastle ( 31 ) than they have for paris st. germain ( 26 )
spurs and newcastle to draw , stoke and swansea to draw , arsenal to win .
all respect to alan padrew . motivated his side so much . sparky newcastle !
is half time newcastle is leading 1-0
when did we stop passing the ball forward at every opportunity ? can't stand the slow build up play and back passing ): come on tottenham !
the newcastle away kit is horrendous
tottenham buy one of the best young talents in the world , lamela , and keep playing him off the bench . 
1-0 to newcastle ! spurs losing
tottenham have won the league twice in their history . arsenal have won the league twice at white hart lane .
newcastle are bossing spurs
shockingly poor tactics from avb , frustrating as always , tottenham need a hero ! 
said from the beginning of the season .. tottenham is not top 4 quality
a boring draw for arsenal v man utd , and a win for newcastle would do me nicely today . come on city ! 
newcastle have secured at least a point now . can't see spurs wining 2 penalties ." << tooo funny plus defoe cnt score cs its not thursday
newcastle have looked like they want it more than spurs , spurs look slow and like they can't really be bothered 
bring back my tottenham !

right money on tottenham come back and soldado to score next ! hope that can spice stuff in this dull game !
said it a season , tottenham are so boring to watch . defiantly miss bale
brazil are playing well . when is the newcastle game on ?
more importantly for newcastle is how disciplined sissoko has been in that 3 man midfield with cabaye & tiote .
13 of newcastle united's 14 league goals this season have been scored by frenchmen .
spurs v newcastle feels like i'm watching germany v brazil when looking at their kits ! ‚ô• :d .
ooohhhh , what did i miss ? remy .... newcastle ..... :) keep it that way .
a great finish from loic remy , followed by two top saves from tim krul , mean newcastle go in 1-0 ahead at the half time break 
i can see newcastle score 1 or 2 more now we're defending with the sun in our eyes
wow that newcastle kit is hurrendous . georgies on a budget !
haka kateam kanaitwa tottenham ni shida tupu since ' one-man-army ' went !!!! their newly acquired 1st 11 inazembea kazini
why don't the so called pundits praise newcastle ? always make excuses for our opposition when we're on top 
newcastle always let me down when i puts bets on them to lose haha !
tottenham only scored 9 goals this season ? wow
tottenham have won the league twice in their history . arsenal have won the league twice at white hart lane . << ouch
yes , come on newcastle
imagine how much tottenham spent this summer but struggling at their favourite ground against stubborn newcastle team ! get in magpies ‚Äù
newcastle beat spurs please .
ht newcastle 1-0 tottenham good result if it continue for us 
newcastle keep this up and finish the game off and that's game number 1 down on the acca 
is it a coincidence friedel's last 3 games and we haven't kept clean sheet ? hull & sheriff in cup and newcastle today ? 
tim krul keeping newcastle ahead here 
highlights by supersports show how fast the newcastle players close down the spurs players when they are in possesion . .
spurs struggling to score against newcastle , this is just weird ... that 1st half was plain and terrible
tottenham playing like a 4-6 place team . oh wait , they are one !! 
since the start of last season , french players have scored more goals for newcastle united ( 31 ) than they have for psg ( 26) .
spurs dropping points would be great . c'mon newcastle .
tottenham minute , 75th minute . i'm calling it now .
hopefully newcastle do us a favour and beat spurs
and it's 1-1 at newcastle lmao
i like avb but our style of play is so defensive compared to harry's . two seasons ago with harry , how many did we put past newcastle ? 5 .
half time . tottenham hotspur vs newcastle united . : half time . tottenham hotspur 0-1 newcastle united , newcastle united ; loic remy 13 '.
tottenham becoming totally useless these days
predicted 2-1 to newcastle before the game and it will be if we don't step it up . bring on lamela , lennon-players that make stuff happen
ht 1-0 . have defended well and looked lively in midfield . krul has produced some fine saves to keep them ahead . 
ht . spurs 0-1 newcastle ..... i miss hugo
like watching brazil 
spurs newcastle will have to wait . has my undivided attention .
tottenham 0-1 newcastle ht loic remy with the goal !!
my dad gets so hyped when the football is on tv . he went mental before when newcastle scored . this from the man who screams at me for noise !
hopefully the tottenham coaching staff have kept a few rockets from bonfire night and put them up the arse of our few players !
remy . :) . i want newcastle win
tottenham r boring to watch they need to use lamela nd erikson every game

yes newcastle ;) do them yids over
newcastle united are the only team outside of the bottom three to have conceded more than 10 goals away from home this season .
every time the newcastle fans rally against mike ashley , the team starts doing mad shit , like beating top 4 teams 2 weeks in a row
so far so good . keep going newcastle see spurs off . 
the wankey tottenham hotspur went to rome to see the pope and this is what he said fuck off !! 
remy's super finish gives newcastle the lead at half-time , let's hope they can hang on and beat tottenham ! 
soo frustrating being a tottenham supporter .
newcastle's 4-4-2 allows them to double up wide , denying us space . but we should counter by getting in the hole . not advancing enough .
don't usually do predictions because i'm crap at them but i'm going for a 3 nil newcastle win .
so many sexy military men and women walking around newcastle today o_o
good first half for us , though tottenham were the better side , but youd expect that with us also away from home , 1-0 up though ! remy on fire
its halftime at white hart lane . tottenham hotspur 0-1 newcastle an early goal for remy separates the teams .

" get that townsend off all he wants to do is fucking shoot " loool some tottenham fans are jokes
newcastle doing best , now sunderland and united must follow suit .
 last year's spurs would have had more of a problem with this physical newcastle side . ref needs to keep an eye
if newcastle beat spurs , we'll be 3rd on the table . 
saving judgement until the end of the game . but so far , talk of tottenham being even top 4 contenders is laughable
remy ! ~ soldado ? spur 1-0 newcastle
come on newcastle ! only supporting them because i hate spurs
 still looking for there best formation while have it simple ... pass to or hope for or 
that newcastle goal has changed everything . spurs now need two penalties to win .

spurs trailing newcastle . epic considering how much spurs ' squad costs
blimey newcastle working hard and putting pressure on the ball . spuds have been sloppy and nervy at the back . hope we keep this up . 
newcastle are doing a great job of stifling the spurs attacks before they happen with niggly fouls in the middle of the park . 
come on newcastle !?
half time score newcastle 1- spurs 0
" newcastle have needed their goalkeeper in the first half ." revolutionary insight from sky pundits .

newcastle are the team this season where they will beat or draw against good teams but drop point against shit teams

so tottenham need to win 9-1 to go second today ?
by the sounds of it spurs looking flat and need some spark ! would be a quality result if newcastle nicked this .. hopefully they can hold on !
sandro and kaboul on . good . will hopefully stop newcastle pinging it about . doesn't solve the ' ball in the net ' conundrum

 tottenham - newcastle gros match !
white hart lane must be worst club in prem for tv cameras . 
so i came up to newcastle thursday for a night out and i'm still here 
newcastle all of a sudden coming to life this season
spurs 1-1 newcastle , sunderland 0-3 man city , man utd 1-2 arsenal 
newcastle should wear the brazil kit more often
that remy goal was the first tottenham had let in this season from anyone outside or london 
it's 1-1 at newcastle !
watching tottenham against newcastle . ( the newcastle ' accent is so strong and ugly ... damn )
i thought that tottenham was playing arsenal for a second
50'min tottenham 0 - 1newcastle
this day is going to be perfect , tottenham newcastle , city sunderland , arsenal united , barca betis
lets go newcastle !!
 hotspurs vs newcastle
just got in and noticed we are losing to newcastleüòÇ ffs tottenham
could do with newcastle holding on here , arsenal and utd drawing and more importantly city winning .
newcastle , arsenal , city and stoke to win 
c'mon newcastle !!!!
apparently that the club was named newcastle united pretty cool , can winning first of spurs .
would love a newcastle counter attack now .
tottenham started the 2nd half on fire , an equaliser is imminent . 
such an honour to represent the british red cross today in newcastle on remembrance sunday .
come on tottenham !! needs you on my accumulator ‚öΩÔ∏èüôè
tottenham is cursed
watching newcastle united today is like watching brazil !
newcastle could easily be in the top 4 with the team they have !
come on tottenham yis cunts
tottenham pilling on d pressure ! can newcastle hold on 2 thr lead !!
2nd half of spurs v newcastle just kicked off . join us for sunderland v man city at 2pm & man utd v arsenal at 4pm
yes newcastle 
newcastle been very good but think spurs bit afraid to throw themselves fully forward with bigger gap between friedel and backline .
tottenham to score off this freekick
i beg tottenham get some1 who can score üòê
there should be no reason why tottenham struggles this much to score goals .. 
newcastle be making tottenham look like they just got promoted to the epl
kru keeping newcastle in this ! come on newcastle !!!
newcastle panicking . doors . early .
i hate tottenham
tim krul is doing an amazing job for newcastle , just sayin '.
spurs can't maintain this pressure , keep them at bay for 15-20 minutes , come on newcastle !
i know they are winning , but why are newcastle dressed like brazil ?
based on d table i want newcastle to beat tottenham n man u shud beat arsenal 
newcastle 7 offsides , highest number of offsides i've seen in a match
i wouldn't have even take a point against newcastle before the game , now i will
tottenham have a free kick about 23 yards out
so if tottenham and arsenal lose , it would be good for chelsea on the long run
tottenham are useless cunts the now man . fucking knew we would struggle against newcastle ! lacking a goal scorer like suarez or rvpüò´
newcastle still have d lead heart lane .
free kick for tottenham
i bet newcastle wish they could wear brazil's kit every week 
a confident newcastle outfit can be really frightening to play against . looking like a " team " again . consistency always an issue though .
fk to newcastle .. great place
who knew ? tottenham play a defensive midfielder and now they look a lot better . paulinho & dembele offer no protection as a two .
tottenham getting closer and closer after every chance 
newcastle can't keep this going . surely a spurs breakthrough is imminent
does newcastle goalie look like brendon fraiser to anyone else 
freekick in an dangerous position . 
i must say that the best away fans are newcastle fans . the toons .
tottenham need to prove they hungry right here . they can obviously score so just do it !
s/o to newcastle
newcastle of life !
knew wba and newcastle would be tough for chelsea and spurs
eriksen has got a bet on a newcastle win .

i got my all time low ticket yesterday for newcastle and im so happy
newcastle need to wake up
i dislike newcastle united
newcastle has a little concentration and looks to concede soon
if newcastle don't score again , we're in trouble
tottenham are statistically the most boring team to watch this season . i should be working on skysports with these kind of stats
loic remy has scored 47% of newcastle's pl goals this season ; the highest proportion of any player in the top-flight 
spurs should equalise in the first 15 , and carry on going at them . newcastle ( bar krul ) can't match this at the moment 
remembrance parade done .. on the way to the game vs newcastle üèÄ leggooo
we're 4th with 21 points . we will remain 4th provided tottenham draws/loses and city draws/loses as well .
 tottenham vs newcastle .
decided im not going to loose the beard untill after i see daniel bryan at newcastle arena on friday night . have to 
newcastle defending with all they got ....

tottenham are soo , soo poor
newcastle singing " nana nana remy " get your own song you mugs 
newcastle playing like they are iraqis , putting the bodies on the line
newcastle are playing way too low ... 2 lines in 4 yards ...
everybody shitting on tottenham but the weird part is that they might win this match .
smashing from newcastle 
newcastle have know well and truly parked the bus
tottenham deserve a goal second half , krul been on top form though
are newcastle really defending a 1-goal lead with so much time left in the game ?
crunchy nut and the rest of the tottenham vs newcastle game üòå
great football from tottenham how ain't we winning
i rate eriksen and paulinio but soldado is shocking , he's been the worst tottenham signing
newcastle are a very mean team
newcastle need to do some serious defending now .

why did tottenham sack harry redknapp ? lol
this newcastle side have a massive team spirit 
come on newcastle
i'm rooting for united and newcastle to win today . what's wrong with me ? üòí
must annoy spurs that newcastle are beating them in the same colours as arsenals away kit ........... 
i saw a person earlier in those cuffed jean things & shoes . guess what ? he had a tottenham scarf on ! beats slip on lonsdales i suppose
if tottenham want to win they need to take eriksen off set pieces
after 65mins , newcastle still lead tottenham 1-0 at whl . 
this tottenham team reminds me of our team 2 or so seasons ago . can't score for *
are newcastle parking the bus this early‚Ä¶ .
come on tottenham ffs !!
newcastle have held on so well , hope they don't lose grip after all the pressure
come on newcastle please keep it up ! 
spurs corner = newcastle goal kick
not one good ball in 65 minutes by eriksen .. tottenham .. you‚Äôre welcome to him ! shit
thing is , newcastle have got another half hour of this . plus the , y'know , mandatory spurs pen .
come on newcastle !
tottenham at home just can't score doesn't makes sense to me 
tot knocking seriously on newcastle's goal area ... like the way dey swtich attacks from both sides of d flank
what the fuck is going on with newcastle ? i don't understand what's happening .
amazing how much tottenham still miss bale .
tottenham - newcastle gros gros match

krul is just d only saving grace newcastle has had this 2nd half . totthenham should be 3 goals up by now .
newcastle brought on another midfielder 4 a striker and what does avb do ? nothing ? such a retard
i hope newcastle can hold this lead 
go on the newcastle boyssss
18 shots on goal . newcastle haven't done anything aside from a 10 minute spell . krul only reason they're still ahead . mullet haired prick .

newcastle hanging on a bit .. really entertaining game
tottenham's fans are about as vocal as norwich's
love how tottenham have scored less goals than norwich this season in the league
tottenham don't have goals in them this season
if tottenham bring defoe on we're fucked
this newcastle v tottenham match is brilliant !! 
tottenham's finishing is absolutely shocking today !
tottenham do play some fast tempo attractive football . good to watch 
what has eaten today ? amazing performance so far 
i'm sure there's a who's got the shittest hair competition going on at newcastle .
newcastle have parked the yellow bus here .
arsenal's away kit and newcastle's away kit being the samba to the premier league ! 
we hate tottenham we hate tottenham
tottenham are losing to newcastle . its a damn shame .

the newcastle goalkeeper , krul is good
i'm disappointed in tottenham man after spending so much they have scored only 9 goals in the league come on avb

as things stand the newcastle win over spurs will benefit us 
remy scored for newcastle 1-0 against tottenham

newcastle wasting time like there's not 25 mind left
hats off to newcastle , for not sitting back with a one goal lead . we wanted a team to come at us and they did . your move 
newcastle need to score a second soon with spurs attacking , no worry since the have krul as a keeper and spurs have sodaldo in strike 
erikson absolutely killing tottenham !!
tottenham has 18 attempts on goal and still not goal :o 
just wonder how much longer will newcastle be able to sustain this constant pressure from spurs 
tottenham would of been so much better off if they signed benteke instead of soldado
tottenham are even making eriksen look shit . smh
i won't critique tottenham's transfer activity until their acquisitions have been given ample time to gel . poor so far , mind .
come on newcastle !

i see the newcastle time wasting train is rumbling on .
newcastle needs to score again to seal this victory .
hahaha ! scum 0-1 newcastle ! lets all laugh at tottenham !
soldado is playing great in defence for newcastle what is he doing avb take him off

wow tottenham vs newcastle is such an entertaining game , tim krul making some incredible saves , at this rate nothing will get passed him
newcastle will let a goal slip ! too much pressure by tottenham
newcastle sitting dangerously deep & inviting pressure . 
someone just said that for a team that spent ¬£100+m in the summer tottenham hasn't scored a lot of goals
this newcastle kit , blurred by the shit stream makes me think of our old old away kit
i just saw a qihui cut down by tottenham

newcastle defence and krul are unbelievable today !
newcastle v tottenham & fifa 14 - not a bad way to spend your sunday .. 
tottenham have scored 9 goals this season and 12 of them have been penalties
tottenham dont need bale they got a ( average ) team instead ......
i think arsenal , united , chelsea , city , liverpool and everton will all finish higher than tottenham this year
hate to say it but can't see not conceding here . endless pressure from , just wait for a bullshit penalty .
tottenham flopping everything
they're finding it hard to break through newcastle's midfield . lots of attacking players not moving into space and just waiting .
howay spurs man . i hate newcastle so much .
actually so disappointed with tottenham right now
c'mon newcastle !
tottenham's set-pieces have been really poor 
come on tottenham , fucking hell .
newcastle did this 2yrs ago . ( time wasted) . it didnt get them any points . b happy wit a draw today . i have a feeling we will get screwed
newcastle united !!!
be amazed if newcastle hold out here . soldado's pen can't be more than 15 mins away ?
serious how are we still behind , we're just dominating and newcastle are still in front by 1 goal . this ain't our day 
done pretty much everything but a newcastle win , sounds right for me .
tottenham firing on all cylinders in need of a goal but grt resistance 4rm n'castle! # tot vs new

howay newcastle ! 
i would love newcastle to win this
think tottenham are missing a certain welsh guy
tim krul having a big game for newcastle . think he'l be snapped up by a big club in the next year or 2 . 
tottenham are shite . so boring to watch .
continuez newcastle aller
i predicted a 0-0 between spurs & newcastle . going for a 4-0 win for city & a 2-2 draw between united & arsenal . 
 do it !!!!
tottenham are really struggling for goals this season , but that what you get for going with 1 striker all the time
lets go newcastle
newcastle winning arsenal win later perfect sunday after 
how newcastle are winning against spurs is beyond me , average team
wow can't believe newcastle is winning spurs .
krul is a beast . 
come on newcastle hold on !
come on tottenham don't make me have to log back on to lay another bet - never should bet on first game .
are spurs actually losing at home to newcastle ahahahahah
newcastle look a much better team minus papiss cisse at the moment
i feel bad for tottenham
carlisle is so much colder than newcastle , whuuut
the tottenham bench is very strong . lennon , lamela , holtby and defoe all game changers sitting there waiting .
really need another newcastle goal just now . spurs are hammering it
i reckon today may be all away wins - newcastle , man city and of course 
krull performance of the century no matter what happens 
newcastle need to make a change man
newcastle hold on
utd , city , chelsea , ars , liverpool would have punished newcastle so bad by now . this is beyond frustrating
got a feeling this will finish 0-2 , with a newcastle counter attack . remy .
tottenham 21 crosses 2 successful you'd think they'd work out a different way to attack by now
i dont understand how a team can even rebound from losing to winless sunderland then beat chelsea and possibly tottenham .
come on newcastle and bring it home today away at old trafford arsenal 4life
newcastle defending class , they'll score on the counter soon
* super sunday update * 68 minutes played & it's still , tim krul 1 v 0 tottenham man of the match
glad people have finally caught on that tottenham isn't as good as their record suggests . been relying on pk's way too much this season .
tim krul is merking it 
whats happened to newcastle like came out looking like headless donkeys on blackpool beach with a toddler on the backs 
come on bale need you to score against newcastle for big money 
tottenham losing with lamela(a ¬£26m signing ) still warming the bench smh

the reporters behind the newcastle goal would have been cacking it when walker came running towards them at pace .
c'mon newcastle
betting toon btts never comes off , why do newcastle never concede though
i thought lamela was meant to be the next ronaldo .... why wouldn't you put him on when your losing to newcastle then ? lol 
defoe getting ready to go in for tottenham . they lead newcastle 1-0 after 67 '
i always thought tim krul newcastle's goalkeeper is one of the best in the world , today i admit it , you are a beast 
come on tottenham u twats .
newcastle holding on
krul hav to change his name to cool good goalkeeping . newcastle hav an upper hand in this . 
andre‚Äôs tottenham have become far too functional and rigid . just not as fluid as his porto side were . need help , andre ? üòä
need newcastle to win sunderland and man utd come on
 greatly underrated , but here comes who generally loves scoring against 
ordinarily spurs would've had a goal but the yellow & blue of newcastle make them think they'ye up against 
don't rate tottenham at all

come on tottenham
if sunderland and united win and this scoreline stays in newcastle's favour , it'll be soooo good for us
spurs-newcastle is panning out into a real old-school british football match . apart from the noon sunday kickoff and the 17 foreign players .
your all over newcastle , just please bag 2 goals . please
tottenham ruining my accumulator already !
defoe on = newcastle concede , watch this space
newcastle playing like shit right now
newcastle would be better off breaking in greater numbers . they're generally better offensively than defensively , a second goal would be key
newcastle are gonna defend this out . we have no penetration .
first half we play like realmadrid second half we play like newcastle
defoe's the only tottenham player i like
fuck off newcastle . so many chances to counter !! just take one of them and score ffs .
lucas haters who compare him with paulinho should take a look at newcastle's first goal . paulinho was at fault- should've stopped cabaye 
this match is too tense üôàneed to hold on newcastle . hahah ‚öΩÔ∏è
hang on newcastle !!
newcastle won't see it out playing like this
the amount of chances tottenham have had , defoe should take some

tottenham piling up pressure , newcastle can't keep this lead .
defoe coming newcastle in january
