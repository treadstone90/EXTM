#1ddaylive i love you you're my idols .... my dreams come true in 29th june in milan ... see you soon . by italian directioner

ac milan/genoa o 2.5 looks nice . 2-0 9 '
milan on the right track .
see . i mention how happy i am for kaka and milan and then genoa scores .... the football gods just really hate me
hadehh , imbang !! keep fight milan
and back to good old milan ...
' live ' ac milan 1-0 genoa ; ' goal ' kaka place an angled drive into the far bottom corner
are you kidding milan !
and milan take the lead ... thanks to ricky ! :d
amazing milan defense ! 
milan you better do disssss
kaka with is 100 goal for ac milan in 200 games . not bad
milan or the matrix ?
nice milan are winning
' live ' ac milan 1-1 genoa ; ' goal ' gilardono pull genoa level from the spot , after emanuelson brought down vrsaljko in the box
what a turnaround gasperini has given since his return as manager of the club .
that lead by milan didn't last long , while we have so much garbage in the team we have to expect that .
something to hope for in milan as kaka give them the lead
kaka has given milan the lead ! ricardo with a golazooo !
good start to the milan game too , real still winning ?
that touch to bring down the ball for the goal from kaka was stunning 
hopefully milan cheer me up a bit
when the fronts doing well , the defender always ruin it . milan in tradition .
joncing milan and allegri
8 ' goal ! ! gila converts the pk and we are all even . 1-1 uk
milan really can't afford to drop anymore points but this is yet another dick of a start tonight ..
we have to win this game . 
still got a small bet on ac milan v genoa ( the latter + 1.5 ah ) but wish i'd had btts now ( 1-1) . we'll see with that one ...
gilardino's penalty cancels out kaka's opener . 1-1 
gilardino has a lot left to give . milan falls asleep again after gaining the lead . rinse , repeat ...
so emanuelson plays lb for us while antonelli ( grown at our youth sector)plays for genoa and he is gonna join napoli soon 
gilardino for 1-1 ac milan vs genoa played 8min
one average natural left back is better for milan than one utility left back . please address this , kojak .
1d day is happening at the same time as the milan game cool
genoa equalise against milan .
meanwhile in italy , kaka has scored in his captain debut against genoa
kaka is back on fire now he's back at milan
this ac milan match should be a good en 👌
dinner . at great italian restoran in milan and nice view . bismillah .
let's go milan !!
genoa just equalised at san siro v ac milan . 1-1 , ten minutes gone .
shall watch real madrid ' game then followed by ac milan's game haha
milan just can't keep a solid lead anymore
i'd recommend switching on the milan game if you have bt sport . if not , find a stream . fantastic to watch so far . it's 1-1 .
this ac milan tho , they never keep their lead .
the fact romeo made the tune it's all gravy with christina milan has him ranked as my top uk artist . 
penalty for genoa .
kaka been look like he was gonna give genoa a hard time with that first early goal
what an awesome game by honda today ! he is really hitting a great stride recently just before his contract expires . milan is lucky . 4
kaka scored for milan today ! the king is back . ♥
forza ac milan , dont give up 
serie a , milan-genoa : official line-ups milan - here are the official line-ups ahead of the match at the san siro : milan :...
that's the definition of being snake-bitten . milan lucic had a wide open net with cam ward down & out , and he hit both posts with one shot
milan put a smile on my checks is been a long time
we have an african player of the year nominee on the bench ! that's how good and deep milan's squad is . ;)
keep calm and always fight !! forza milan ....
never realised shelvey played in goal for ac milan ? 
kaka going back to milan is a good example of why torres should go back to anfeild😏
why is napoli match not telecasted on any channels unless they play against milan , juventus or other top teams .? 
oh look genoa equalized ..
so in 3 minutes , managed to give genoa a penalty and earned himself a yellow card ! job well done !

ac milan , real madrid and spurs amongst many sides seem to be having left back issues . kids , become left backs . you'll get jobs .
ac milan are so poor , but they are just a mid table team now .

just know milan are gunna flop on me
kaka with a great touch and a lovely finish into the bottom left corner in the 3rd minute . his gaol cancelled out by a genoa penaly 1-1 .
2 milan defenders booked in the first 12 minutes
hey ref , genoa is playing you like connect 4
please genoa !!!
the acclaimed genoa attack causing milan’s defenders serious problems early ..
i am so glad to see kaka doing well at ac milan , hope he gets in brazil's world cup squad
kaka looks a bit more like his old self , since joining ac milan
and what a goal by kaka . beautiful touch , there . ac milan 1-0 genova . 
just within ow many minutes milan
owh how ac milan have fallen
2 yellow card already in 13 minutes for milan defense ..
he's back to hunt milan
milan will loss zappata on the next game after he received a yellow card .
business has only two functions - marketing and innovation . - milan kundera
milan race to 7 corners ! odds 1.72
i just love kaka , he made the right decision , only if milan other players were better = . =
immediately though genoa gets a penalty against ac milan after 7 minutes with 
milan : penalty and two yellows in 13 minutes ... baresi's class and maldini's grace don't visit milanllo anymore
what is with ex milan players always scoring against milan . tcha .
milan & the sour goat at mtg tonight !!
milan is on abc family , but i should really go for a run ... or at least get off the couch . 
chance from a corner for ac milan
the amount of injuries and bans milan get is uncanny
matri deal costed milan around 30m€ . galliani , wtf ?
kaka gives milan the lead , former milan player gilardino equalises
emmanuelson are you mad ? penalty taken and scored by gillardino milan 1 genoa 1
83 minutes to go in the 90 minute game at ac milan 1 genoa 0 and gilardino equalises for genoa against 
milan better win this game , else ..................!
8 ' goal ! ! gila converts the pk from mp4 to 3gp !
time to watch ac milan ahead of tuesday night .
we are taking " can it get any worse " to a whole new level 
 madrid . . . milan . munchen .... my favorit team .
milan is on ! yessss 🙌
ac milan as he scores the genoa penalty against ac milan after 8 minutes with 82 minutes 
milan pegged back by gillardino 
come on milan 
to go in the 90 minute game as he makes it ac milan 1 genoa 1 
crisis ? what crisis ? ac milan take an early lead against genoa
i'd rather milan play with no center backs than have to watch mexes and zapata defend like hellen keller 😤
gila and kaka scored . no , we're not in 2007 and we're not 2-0 ahead of genoa . it's 1 even and the defense is already struggling in 16 mins .
seeing kaka playing is better than seeing milan wining 
milan ate pressing from the front ? that's surprising ad much as its refreshing .
eating ice cream and watching milan😌
ac milan 1-1 genoa both teams score after 8mins tick that off !!
milan at it again . can't we keep a clean sheet .
do you remember the last time milan won with a clean sheet ? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . no you don't you fucking liar
genoa is 7th , what ?!! when did that happen ?!
ac milan r bullshit
explain me how do we keep loving milan ?
milan stinks , sorry cos .
sad to see how poor milan are these days . used to be a european powerhouse but now they are mid table playing unadventurous football 
kaka is on fire now he is back at milan 
watching milan genoa on ipad nice to watch a game when your not shitting it or getting over- excited every time the ball goes near the goal
kakà after 2 minutes , milan-genoa 1-0 . the usual invincible opposition from genoa in san siro ( joking eh )
milan always concedes
benfica win , now just need milan to win for £167
milan is on . life just got so much better
milan are pressing from the front ? that's surprising as much as its refreshing .
kaka reincarnating @ milan another class finish
for my money , the genoa away kit is the best in the serie a . elegant simplicity . great work by lotto .
i wonder if balotelli hates having kaka with him on milan
i swear i could manage milan better than allegri - . -
milan playing good ..
corner for ac milan
im enjoying watching this football , and thats the first time ive been able to say that about a milan game for ages
milan .. come on ... u gotta win 
when i see a player like muntari playing for a team like ac milan , then i realise that there's hope for everyone .
keepcalm and always support milan :))
gila scoring against milan just feels so wrong .
like everyone else in the country i am watching milan v genoa in serie a
reilly and milan 😁 could this game get any better ?
the more frustrated i get with milan , the more i love the milanisti i follow on twitter
milan are in such bad form
adil rami and honda ... january can't come quick enough 
the momentum at the ... suddenly restores belief in this dead team .
22-0 our first quarter ! everyone played great . milan up next !
milan needs help
 1-1 22 ' match has settled . not much has happened since goals . hopefully it will pick it soon . 
we are anything but milan
it's really hard to see antonini in a genoa shirt </3
come on milan ... 
get in benfica ! now milan , real , napoli , porto & athletico to complete a great day !
orvc boys jamboree @ jcd .... south ripley defeats milan 18-12 in 6th qtr
oooh shit , my milan is actually playing right now !!! can't stream two things at the same time ! sorry , devils , next match , i swear !
milan never shouldve agreed to cooperate with make a wish's request of having matri and muntari start with their team
milan must learn to keep clean sheet
milan lucic breaks away up the ice , but blows a tire and passes to krejci who dangles but is robbed by ward . still 2-1 .
come on milan and madrid !
eric staal mightve gotten away w/trip there on milan lucic's pp rush , but even after non-call on chara's two-hander during tlusty breakaway

matri would be my last choice in milan attack . i would start a defender in his position .
milan are playing very well going forward . good movement with and without the ball so far .
yep 23 minutes in and milan bedding in like chievo facing down barcelona .. and into mr mindless himself ... matri lurches it over the bar

just need milan and napoli to win , then porto to win by 2 or more
in this very week in 2008 , ac milan visited fratton park in the uefa cup and needed late goals from ronaldinho and inzaghi to nab a point .
acm 1-1 gen : since leaving ac milan in 2008 , gilardino has now scored two goals in 10 serie a matches v milan .
just got out the shower , ac milan winning 1-0 goal but kaka and real madrid winning 2-0 with a goal benzema just scored 😁
milan lucic pass is behind torey krug on pp & that springs patrick dwyer for a sh breakaway . he beats johnson and ties it up 2-2 
1-1 against genoa not good enough , need to improve
shoot the fucking puck milan !
#1dday i love you ! please follow back !! you are my idols ! coming to see you in milan !! 28/06/14 going to be the best day of my life ! ❤️♥️💙💚💜

balotelli causing plenty of problems for genoa's defense . -faz
come on milan !!! 
that's the one . the mario i want to see . get involved . 
go go go genoa .
hope milan gets 3 points today . i would hate to see allegri get fired .
whoeva bet on winning this match must be on a long tin , but there's still time
loving this multiple , please montpellier and milan , win !
forza milan w 3a rase w kel shi , bas hay mesh 7ale
half an hour gone at san síro !! ac milan 1-1 genoa , at the moment .
5 fold still has potential to win madrid a clear 2-0 up , lyon still 1-0 up , az somehow still 2-1 up ! c'mon milan and napoli !
if ac milan loses today ! allegri ! ! !
 is full of contributions at . wins penalties , gets assists , etc . are you even watching ? 
all i need now is atletico madrid to score two for £167 and milan to win for £105 . both four folds down to these last two games .
classic incompetent refereeing in this milan match
hopefully milan keep up this run of shite form for tuesday 🙏
dese officials jus fucking wid milan

balotelli collects kaka's incise pass before fizzing a shot between a defender's legs and agonisingly past the post 
acm 1-1 gen : since leaving ac milan in 2008 , gilardino has now scored two goals in 10 serie a matches v milan .
kaká has scored for milan a while ago ! that's something that used to be so familiar back in the years . him and r7 , just in time at wc year .

goooooooooooooooalll gent 1-0 min 65 ajax 1-0 min 41 ac milan 1-1 min 41 ( genoa with 10 players ) porto 0-0 min 9

i don't think i feel very comfortable in a world in which mario balotelli misses penalties . it's so very disconcerting ! 
 milan ... 
penalty for milan ... perin denied balotelli's penalty ..
how many penalties have milan had this season
the only time i watch ac milan ... balotelli misses a penalty .
balo wtf man . it's depressing to watch milan this year
manfredini went off with a red card . genoa with ten men . 
balo is not balo these days .. actually milan is not milan these days
how genoa man get send off for that is beyond me
and its penalty 4 milan yehhhhh !!!!
i blame the milan bosses for making him change his hair . you take control of a man’s hair and he is lost .
you know milan aren't gunna do it if a balotelli misses a pen
balotelli didn't even try to get to the ball after the miss . he looks unhappy at .
thank for this day in milan ! 
balotelli missed penalty for the second at his professional career . and both happened in milan .

every gk becomes buffon against milan :)
thomas manfredini ( genoa ) got a red card
milan pressing hard in this first half
ooh ! balotelli has penalty saved . he no happy . perin , genoa keeper , doing well .
balotelli needs to get away from ac milan . his confidence is shattered . 
 yes , ynwolfe - but isn't milan like , a world fashion capital ?!?!
at-least genoa are down to ten men . 
ballotelli with a tame effort from the penalty spot 1-1 milan genoa
ha ha rigore per il milan ? and no goal , what the bad luck balotelli merda !
balo gets a penalty saved twice in a season ? that means things aren't going well for milan !
balotelli missed another pen ! that's two this season - that record fell apart real fast 
balotelli missing another penalty when i've got money on milan !
genoa playing in 10 , the player was sent off for the foul on mario
in game bets , milan win - 1.20 , draw 2.75 , parma win - 4.80
balo misses from the spot . this might just be a sign for a loss . 
milan is really really in big problems
genoa are playing in 10 men after thomas manfredini was shown the red .
milan with another penalty ... what else is knew its sad how you have to cheat against genoa
milan should snatch perin from genoa while they can . 
balo might be starting to ruin his career in milan
last 26 early home goal ( 0-20 mins first goal ) reads home won 22 drawn 2 and lost 2 milan number 27
bale scores 5th goal for madrid & balotelli misses another penalty for ac milan ... laliga 
bloody hell balotelli . stop missing penalties ! 
balo just gave a clinic on how not to take a penalty 
still an uphill task for genoa with manfredini sent off .
bales scores again 4 madrid as balotelli miss a pen for milan .
penalty for milan but balotelli misses !
super mario missed a pk unheard of ac milan
balotelli misses a penalty , again . still 1-1 milan-genoa . i remember it being the world toilet day a few days ago . 
milan is so shit that even the best penalty taker can stop scoring penalties
penalty for milan but balotelli misses !
balotelli jus missed a penalty , world must be ending 
my days balotelli missed another fucking penalty against genoa
this tells the success story of milan this season
last 26 early home goal serie a ( 0-20 mins first goal ) reads home won 22 drawn 2 and lost 2 milan number 27
milan never lose * in my mind *
milan should win easy now
the score right now for ac milan is 1-1 vs genoa kaka scored & i forgot who scored from genoa but it was a penalty
ballotelli misses the penalty for milan and bale actresses a goal for my real madrid . oh .

woeful balotelli penalty saved . genoa down to ten men , still 1-1 .
milan have broken balo
come on balotelli !!!!!! come on milan !!!!!
penalty missed it remains 1-1 genoa dwn to 10 men
now watch milan fail since penalties are no more guaranteed goals for them
hope milan lose the match from here on . would be the perfect send off for max .
penalty for milan but balotelli misses !! -hb
balotelli has just missed a penalty for ac milan .
real madrid manager carlo ancelotti has not ruled out a return to ac milan , stating he will " always say yes " to the club . 
need ac milan to win for £100 and balotelli is missing penalties for fun😡😡😡
matri is a bit like celery , in that he is completely pointless 
hmmm kaka gone back milan and is captain already yes 
so , balotelli misses another penalty . very interisting . milan - genoa 1-1
for my milan friends , massimiliano allegri's coaching thesis was on the " characteristics of the three midfielders in a three-man midfield ."
baloo , what have milan done to you !
come on milan ..
everything happens in milan games nowadays .
that's milan's season in a nutshell though 
c'mon milan 
balo missed a penalty !! 
genoa player sent off , and balotelli misses the pen .. just need milan to win for £105 . 1-1 after 40mins
the red side of milan is in flames , while we , inter , are just here .. chilling .. you know .. in fourth place .. 3pts away from ucl .
beat milan on tuesday and a last minute scissor kick from ambrose at the nou camp will take is through to the last 16

nightmare season for milan and balotelli . wtf !

always fun to watch this milan team play because of 
ba'lol'telli . for 2 times his penalty denied . sad ! come on , milan !
milan aren't going to win today with that luck ! 
milan should be 2 or 3 up by now ... 
milan should be leading 4-1
on a positive not , milan are actually playing really well .
mario balotelli has missed a penalty against genoa
chillax time watching milan vs genoa .

milan you guys make me wanna stab myself
mario balotelli's penalty records : inter 6/6 city 9/9 milan 6/8 italy 4/4 total 25 out of 27 .
if milan doesn't win against 10 men .... all hope is lost
balotelli misses his second penalty . wonder if he regrets joining milan ? ;) haha .
the chief of the milan lab must be a juventino . nice .
worst case scenario - 90th minute antonini cross and gilardino winner for genoa .
what's gotten into milan ...
missed penalty , like 10players in genoa's 18yrd , home advantage , yet only 1goal ; this is a cursed milan side ! i don tire lol
milan is unlucky
needless to say , milan cannot continue to tolerate balotelli's missed pks .
muntari seems have pulled his groin . don't need to add players to their injury list .
today , we already loose two players because of injuries d: 
milan has to be my favorite italian team 👏
& now another player for milan gets injured - . -
lol , genoa equalized
sully muntari has pulled up injured . excellent news bring on saponara , cristante or niang . 
vrsaljko has looked great , finding it difficult to believe that bigger clubs than genoa didn't go in for him
balotelli missed 2 penalties for milan

comee on milan 
definitely all milan that half .
it was a stupid decision by milan to loan prince boateng to schalke 05 
better half from milan
ht milan 1 - 1 genoa , matri should be sent off already , bring in binho
over 2.5 goals in the chelsea , bayern & real madrid games up now just want an a . c . milan win for a little £10 acca .
kaka hit some nice form at milan tho already looking like the leader
ht : ac milan 1 ( kaka ) vs genoa 1 ( gillardino ) keep calm and always fight !!! 
please guys follow me :) you can make me happy ... nest year i can't meet you to milan ... please guys :) #1ddaylive
first half .. ac milan 1-1 genoa ..
halftime milan vs genoa , 1-1 . goals kaka ( assist de jong) , gilardino ( pk) . balotelli missed a penalty kick at 1-1 . 
best game from milan in san siro since ages yet somehow its only 1-1 ( thank urby for that) . hoping to see either cristante or saponara in .
let's continue the spirit of milan ! our milanista will always support you ! don't ever give up ! you can definitely get up ! 
someone could you please tell milan's board member that alergi must be out tonight
apart from the red card , liability from urby and muntari , milan really play as a team today .
great work from poli down the flank before the half .. matri is the worst !! 
conceded a ac milan penalty against genoa/conceded as ac milan have a penalty against genoa 
 1-1 ht milan on top . miss penalty by balotelli maybe regretful but they should win v 10 men . 
at this point idc all i ask is for milan to spend some money in january
halftime : milan-genoa 1-1 ! we better win this game , were playing with a man more !
ht : milan 1-1 genoa . goals from kaká and gila w/ a red card for genoa . a balotelli miss followed the red card . can we win just one match ? -ms
ac milan has a lot of work to do ! their current form is really poor
#1ddaylive omg i love youu , do you prefer italy or america ? see ya in milan guys , byee <3
" business has only two functions - marketing and innovation ." - milan kundera 
man , this second half is going to be absolutely exhausting for genoa
ht milan 1-1 genoa brilliant 1st half at san siro . exquisite kaka goal to mark 200th app , gilardino ( p ) manfredini ( rc ) n balotelli miss pen !
half-time : ac milan 1-1 genoa 
it's been 17 matches this season in all . and milan have never went in leading at ht . shame .
milan-genoa 1-1 at the break ... first half featured a made pk for genoa and a missed pk by balotelli
the only time i enjoy watching milan is on youtube . 
this looks like the game where milan will dominate the possession , but then genoa will score the winner . 
even when milan have a free oppurtunity to score they fk it up
im so close to winning this multiple , come on napoli and milan !
milan showed beautiful football in the first half . 
also again after 36 minutes with 54 minutes to go in the 90 minute game at ac milan 1 genoa 1 
he doesnt get to lose that much : mario balotelli's penalty records : inter 6/6 city 9/9 milan 6/8 italy 4/4 total 25 out of 27 .
milan controlling the game so far but balotelli missed penalty twice now .
kaka has been a good signing for milan
mt . ac milan 1-1 genoa . 
despite all those missed chances , i'm still sure milan is going to nail this one . everyone is so alive on the pitch .
ht : ac milan 1 ( kaka ) vs genoa 1 ( gillardino ) keep calm and always fight !!! 
nd dats hw balotelli cudnt score the penalty for milan against parma
omggggggggggggggggggggggg why are people saying gaga will be in milan on february 2014 for versace ? no no no no i'm gonna die !
mario balotelli just missed a penalty for milan
balotelli missing penalties , muntari injured , and matri still missing easy chances . what else can go wrong for ?
balotelli's penalty record for 6/8 total penalty record ( inter , city , milan and italy ) 25/27
robinho plays ' well ' for milan , called up by brazil . plays great for brazil , allegri benches him . our coach is a genius .
milan and napoli sort your heads out
however once again balotelli misses a ac milan penalty this season against genoa after 37 minutes 
ht : ac milan 1 ( kaka ) vs genoa 1 ( gillardino ) keep calm and always fight !!! 
ht : ac milan 1 ( kaka ) vs genoa 1 ( gillardino ) keep calm and always fight !!!

if we're not aware by now that milan can't hold a lead or score the easiest of goals , then we haven't been watching . same old shit . -al
love how milan are using matri as a scapegoat . talking about pazzini as if he was inzaghi
milan is on 💫
seriously not even worth watching milan anymore
half time here at san síro !! kaká with the initial opener but was later cancelled out by gilardino's penalty . ac milan 1-1 genoa .
with 53 minutes to go in the 90 minute game as the score in the match remains ac milan 1 genoa 1 
ayyyyyyyyyy milan !
did anyone else almost forget that ronaldinho played for milan ? 😂
bad game for milan , but a great show from kaka '
steve is offering his services for demolition . clients need only to have the milan game on while he works . everything will be broken !
just casually pointing out that milan's descent into hilarity started right around the same time that camurria jumped ship . 
#1dday i love you ! please follow back !! you are my idols ! coming to see you in milan !! 28/06/14 going to be the best day of my life ! 💜💜

me & milan gone be turnt tf up at this party
it's a good thing when milan open the scoring , but then they seem to panic . conceding a goal becomes inevitable . however , i see a milan win .
milan has seen better days .....
milan can either come out of the locker room ready to take the game or settle for a draw . wouldn't bet so much on the former . -al
come on ac milan win this one for us diehard faithful fans
milan is my favorite disney movie .
i like matri & think he really does try hard & think he can do some good stuff , but man is he frustrating to watch ... 
15 matches with milan and only one goal scored !! not even olivera was this bad
i'm going out ! hope milan somehow overcome the game & will win finally ! kaka is fighting on his own ! we robinho at the 2nd half !
this kind of shit that can divides real supporters from karbitan supporters ... forza milan !
what milan desperately needs is confidence . that's what is ultimately holding them back , in my opinion .
milan , just please win . make me happy .
anyone who bet on ac milan tonight simply cos they're a big club you're a retard twat
shot 10:01 shottarget 7:1 ballposession 55-45 babak pertama , forza milan .
i need more followers .
genoa in 10 men . muntari most probably is out . shouldn't we probably move to 4-2-3-1 ? no ? 
however once again balotelli misses another/a ac milan penalty this season against genoa after 37 minutes 
there's three constants in life . death , taxes , and allegri's milan dropping points on the weekend .
#1ddaylive milan !!!
come on ac milan
with 53 minutes to go in the 90 minute game as the score in the match remains ac milan 1 genoa 1 
milan is on , i don't want to get ready for work 😩
sometimes i will be there . 
unbelievable at how bad ac milan are compared to what they used to be
if ac milan drops point today ... i liv them for good
i dont care .. because i love milan
balotelli missed a penalty for milan😩
so milan holds a meeting ... hope we see ' club statement ' very soon .
milan probably lost money 2 times more than what they gained from selling our top players just look how san siro is so empty
il milan >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
from milan . follow me !! and hangout us too ( me and my best friend ) i'm simona simi on google+
just found out milan wanna buy perin last summer .. like seriously ?! duh .
curvasud membentangkan banner : " from the golden years of the great milan to the years of zapata & constant " they missing about allegri :)
milan need a whole re-vamp of the team . a part from maybe abate and de jong , the whole team look uninterested or aren't good enough ...
little positive end of the day : over treble landed when sochaux equalised and milan leads 5-0 corners at ht ! race to 7 looks good !
i am genuinely embarrassed that kakà had to return to a team as bad as this milan
the milan fans do not pull punches !
watching the game 😘 
brilliant decision making , as i said . i wish i could have a job with milan , results and performance don't mean anything . $$$$
milan track suit top is 75 bucks lls idk if i shud get it
come on ac milan & napoli you set of crooked , ref-bribing shysters 
balotelli misses another penalty . damn . milan 1-1 genoa at halftime .
other teams be fighting to avoid relegation , milan be fighting to go relegation , smh
curva : " from the golden years of the great milan to the years of zapata & constant " 
milan best not let me down
that said , milan should be ahead this half . balotelli’s last two penalty for milan is just poor . hardly “ world class ” saves from the gks .
milan needs to win this half of football & balotelli needs to score a goal
balotelli missed another peno for milan !!
i see the giants of italian football ac milan and napoli both drawing 1-1 and 0-0 at half time ! zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
morning sun come up with the victory of ac milan 
watching ac milan vs genoa in my friend's house
whats happening to ac milan and inter milan ? those clubs are going extinct

from the golden years of the great milan to the years of zapata and constant . curva sud . 
can we just take advantage of a 10-man genoa and win a match this month
i know bertolacci doesn't fit gasperini's system whatsoever , but genoa have nothing up the middle in terms of attack .
getting ready for the second half of milan genoa , can the ligurians get a first victory at san siro since 1958 ? live commentary moments away
come on milan you can do it !!!! 3pts
can't picture balotelli leaving after a year at milan .
come on milan
genoa are down to 10 men , if they don't win this b&g should already know what to do .
i still maintain that barcelona , real madrid , bayern munich , manchester united , ac milan are european club football warlords anyday anytime !
watched some highlights of the ac milan game
ceasar milan's leader of the pack aroused my desire for dogs .
i refuse to believe bertolacci isn't worthy of genoa's xi . annoying to see gasp's same-old 3-4-3 .
so it's down to ac milan to win my bet , just checked italian table and they're 10th ! 
balo missed another pen ... xd what the hell , man😧 
go milan
the maradona of nova gorica looks set to come on for milan .

hotel chilling in milan eating pizza from the box .
milan is such a good movie
if that ac milan shirt was my size i would fuckin ' buy it
genoa be playing for a draw ... and all allegri can think of is to bring in a stale midfielder instead of one of his useless attackers ...
pure shit !!!!!!!! thats what milan is
watching milan vs genoa ... kaka looks cool with captain armband 
i forgot i'm going to milan's 😂 i should probably get ready
allegri needs to be sacked . only won serie a first year because milan had a bomb squad and serie a sucked . he has no emotion/drive
ac milan have turned so shit all of a sudden
" birsa , feel free to punish your former club . i know you won't celebrate , because you have that milan class ."
ac milan to win and napoli to win 2/1 
let me taking in the 2nd half of this milan match

seriously are genoa playing with ten ? 
kaka trying to get his team to play ball ; balotelli taking on all of genoa by himself , to no effect ; matri tactically unaware . -al
oh my god ! milan curva sud raised a banner saying " from the golden years of the great milan to the years of zapata & constant ."

matri isn't just poor but unlucky as well . terrible mix for a milan no . 9 .
real poor playing , milan ! no problemo ...
sad what has become , actually horrible to watch them play , no intricacies , just direct poor football
who wants to be my valentine and go to milan ?!
is milan an agent for the pigs explains why he sacked mego@ and why he's not sacked the fat scouser
genoa's keeper is only 21 and that amazing ..
perin is a real talent .. not gabriel .. even though gabriel is talented but not this much .. not milan level .
this genoa goalkeeper is a fucking wall holy shit !
 1:1 min 60
genoa's goalkeeper saving amazing shots
perin is unreal . saving genoa once again
good lord . what will it take to get a milan goal ?
score now milan you don't have all day
matri getting closer and closer !!! and milan is getting closer closer wtf come on !!!
me aint kno weh kinna football milan playin uh nuh
i'm so happy for rm , i swear milan if you continue like this i'll join al-qaeda just for matri .
de jong though <3 <3 he has never had a bad game in a milan shirt & he is the heart & soul of that milan midfield .
so tonight marks a big event , i'm going to medusas without even one person from genoa . times do change
oh no what's happening to milan niall ? #1ddaylive
come on milan
genoa keeper is having an absolute worldie
" from the golden years of the great milan to the years of zapata & constant "... d milan fans @ d sansiro raised dis banner 2nite 
liverani's genoa would've already bent over .
if milan fail to get through the group stage of the champions league , then it will be immediately following .
please milan ......... score at least one more time & not let any more goals in - . -
 parcial 1 - 1 .
milan could very well have 4-5 goals .
milan can't afford not to win this . against 10 men ... time is running out for an assault on 3rd place too
milan is just sad now .
#1ddaylive 28 june . san siro . milan . we will be there . we are so happy . we love you
it's all milan now , but perin fingertips a matri header over the bar i love this league "
perin excellent for genoa ... milan forwards clueless . who says genoa are playing with 10 men ? 
perin the only thing stopping milan picking up 3 points today . 
watching this ac milan match and am like " wtf is wrong with balotelli
balotelli misses a penalty the day i have milan in an accumulator 
this ball won't go in for milan at all
perin , the genoa gk should be in the italy squad for the world cup , behind buffon of course 
come on milan
" the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting ." - milan kundera
i firmly believe zapata will be as good as baresi was for milan .
don't get me wrong . i admire the militancy of curva sud supporting milan .
man of the match : genoa’s keeper mattia perin .. class !!
this genoa defense tho ....
come on milan ! win this !! 
milan is the shit
ac milan ur the dumbest of them all
mario balotelli's penalty records : inter 6/6 city 9/9 milan 6/8 italy 4/4 25 out of 27 .
i hate allegri mn kull galbii . he managed to ruin milan .
still not sure who's milan and who's genoa .
ac milan needs a change and it has to start from the president . the whole management need to be honest with themselves .
anybody can confirm if gaga will be in milan on feb ?
ac milan are the kings of fucking up accumalators these days can't even beat 10 man genoa ffs
come on napoli , milan and a . madrid !!!
boxing coupons looking good so far , just waiting on milan and napoli as well !
my dad always leaves it so late before getting tickets , we're hardly going to get tickets for ac milan now hahaha
playing against 10men .. ac milan can't still score ..
has delighted the fans of a.c. milan with the signing of javier hernandez . 2014
like who is milan anyway¿ ?
 1-1 65 ' milan as expected still on top but not able to get past . they need more urgency . 
spirit of 45 milan !
is genoa proving strong head or milan striking force weak ?
idk if anyone noticed but genoa are playing with 10 men ..
milan is such a cute movie !
 should still come out of this with a win but they've been thoroughly unimpressive in the final third so far
tbl league g7 , galatasaray won on court of torku selçuk univ . 69-91 , now 4-3 . milan mačvan performed 9 pts ( 3/5 2pt , 1/3 3pt ) 6 rebs in 15 '.
fuck off milan , fuck off napoli
next wk .. celtic play ac milan and that shower play st peters pipe band on monday nite ... says it all ..... now fuck off
ac milan should sack this clown already
my 1500th tweet is reserved for allegri securing his job as milan's coach after losing 1000 games
will be raging if ac milan dont win 
this is not milan after all
need a win from napoli and milan here ! please god
babes gone love this hair . we don't have milan tonight so we getting grown ! ctfu
ac milan playing shiiii 👎👎
milan struggling again
i want to change my name , milan is getting boring
come on milan , 25mins left ffs
need milan to win and balotelli missed an effin penalty !!!!
milan still trying to score !!! kaka is playing very well trying his best to make his team win ... 
come on ac milan
my 1500th tweet is reserved for allegri securing his job as milan's coach after losing 1000 games .
i'm struggling to understand how milan are tied 1-1 . balotelli missed a penalty , and milan players in general are incredibly wasteful today .
serie a ac milan vs genoa 7.45 pm- 9.45 pm
how shit are ac milan
 i think milan will be looking this week for a new manager jones will have his last game next week
matri has missed more shots today than genoa's whole team have taken . 
what a good goal that would have been from milan and matri . encouraging stuff 
so unfair , disappointing and shameful for the curva to single out zapata/constant ;p utting their names on d banner for show is unruly 
this balotelli-matri would be magical if either one of them weren't on such a horrible goal scoring drought 
milan ruined marios penalty taking techniques
its sad when you see kaka playing as a playmaker striker and a defender just to win a game for milan
wow ... milan really can't score today ,..
milan are finding it difficult to penetrate the genoa defence ... that doesn't sound right
milan are a man up and can't score .. against genoa ... that's horrid
milan looking clueless
still , matri scores the best goals from all milan players . if you know what i mean .
milan look tired just let this yr be over plz
someone needs to tell matri that he now plays for milan , not for juventus !
how i cant watch the milan game <
milan still drawing 1-1 with genoa at home . away side down to 10 men , balotellli has missed a pen .. plus muntari off injured ...
#1ddaylive genoa is waiting for you ! thanks for everything guys .. i love you , see ya in milan !! byee
ac milan's first goal 😍😍👌⚽
ac milan dey draw atm , who knows , they may even lose in the end . slacked payints
has been appointed as manager of a.c. milan . 2014
 1-1 
so i need ac milan to win and balotelli managed to miss a penalty , mofo
freekick for milan
if napoli , milan and athletico don't win i give up with accumys 
watchin the milan game .... wow they r pish man !!
so how's that retreat going for milan ?
hows milan struggling to break down this dead 10 man team . smh
napoli vs inter milan would be the derby of the cheaters .
 might not back as what we use to see him , but at least he still have that touch ! 
watching .
milan still not able to get past perin and 10 man genoa , one way traffic
watching milan is painful at the minute . the death of a supernova .
i swear if kaka is injured , at the hands of antonini , i will forget antonini ever played for milan ! : @
we are into the final 10 minutes here in san síro !! it's still ac milan 1-1 genoa , at the moment .
lol we can't score against a 10man genoa .. perin is playing amazing today
14 of last 16 head to heads between milan and genoa have ended under 2.5 goals
this milan game just proves that allegri needs to and 
i did . it know genoa had buffon on goal !
jones lost the plot , players lost the motivation , milan lost the love :( 
every goalkeeper against milan becomes buffon
i'm losing patience with this milan side .
mattia perin is definitely someone milan should look at as a long term replacement for abbiati .. much more confident than gabriel 
balo isn't shit at all . he's holding milan up . all over the pitch this kid .
come on milan !! my commentator is going to rip is hair off now im scared of this guy
catso !!!! forza milan .... no excuses here ... must get the full 3 points playing a man up for all of 55 minutes !!!!! andiamo !!!
milan can't beat 10 man genoa at home . if that's not shameful , i don't know what it is .
just remembered that genoa are actually playing with 10 men . goes to show how terrible milan are right now .
go milan go milan !!! 
milan irritating with this coryy shit !
balo just killing milan this hole game
allegri you dumbass , a draw at home against genoa is like losing 5 games straight so do something !!!
milan needs goal scoring training !!
come too fuck ac milan
come on the fuck milan
mattia perin is like a man possessed for genoa . amazing keeper
20 minutes to go in milan ... let's see what kind of tactics has in store for us
you would think that after all these shot attempts , the ball would find its way into the net . someway , some how ... 
guess im going to milan basketball game monday ❤ && hopefully humboldt still have their game so i can go see them tuesday .
milan are wasteful , not that perin is having an excellent game in post
i'm watching milan and that bad guy i swear is scary a'f .....
milan score already jare
ac milan 1-1 with genoa . 20 minutes left . genoa are 28/1 ? mental ! £2 on lol .
you know that milan is really bad when aljazeera does not broadcast the game on any of the hd channels !
in football luck only takes you half the journey , you gotta work hard to finish the job off . work hard milan don't wait for luck 
insanity : doing the same thing over and over again expecting things to change . así es el caso del milan .
milan + this french toast & bananas . perfect saturday afternoon at work .
we're struggling to maintain a draw vs a 10 man genoa .. this is pathetic
milan starts with m mussolini starts with m coincidence ? no ! they should have a similar political ideology to the great leader
please milan maybe a winner no ?
dr who is shit , so is x factor :) mind you , so is this milan team haha ! least i can wind up the milan fan up at work haha
come on milan !!!!
chievo beat verona in the derby ?! kaka scores for milan and balotelli misses a penalty !! that's why i love serie a , unpredictable ! 
that milan team though , incredible .
milan is really becoming top notch at those curling shots that land in the stands .... nice of them to reward the fans with sporting gifts
get a fucking goal milan !
why take poli off , looks like he's started to come into his own . take matri off ! 
why did poli come off ? he was playing well ! should have been matri ! 
ac milan are proper bollocks ! 
and yes im watching it cos i have a bet in and no it's not currently a winning ticket ;) come on milan ffs
ac milan are looking for goal by all means ... 😂
lol at the milan players all trying the ' cut inside , drop a shoulder and bend it ' routine . 
get out of town emanualson !!!! va fanculo ... 4 men in the box and he tries a low percentage shot from 25 yards out 
instead of milan to take off de jong as their playing against ten men they take off a more creative player
milan going with the all out 4-1-3-2 . every possible goal scorer on the field .
please milan ...... just win please .......... school makes me really sad & it would really help if you could score your chances & win !!!!!
it really shows how good this milan team is . genoa has given the rossoneri an extra player for most game , but it doesn't show on the field .
come on as milan please
is on antidepressants , haven't seen any rage from him and lack of rage is affecting his game 
substition former manchester city player robihno comes onn for andrea poli ac milan 1 genoa 1
past milan's would've destroyed 10 men genoa . allegri is destroying the team . sorry , they have the players to beat genoa !
milan are struggling to beat a 10 man genoa ...
would be tasty if napoli and genoa could score one each in the last 15
how have milan not scored , utter shite - cmon !!
mario balotelli's penalty records : inter 6/6 city 9/9 milan 6/8 italy 4/4 total 25 out of 27 .

it would be nice if milan could win a game against a bottom tier team in the san siro .....
basically we are playing with only dejong as a defensive midfielder ! genoa to score on the counter ?
milan and genoa are currently tied 1-1 in the second half .
i hope milan can win this game !
get the finger out milan ya cunts !
milan be tweakin i swear to god
i haven't watched a milan game in over a year .... and im a milan fan but what do u want to see in a milan game these days ....
 1-1 76 ' pass , pass , pass is all milan are doing . they are lacking an aggression to win . 
come on milan !!!!!!!!!
watching is no longer an enjoyable experience . balotelli and matri are creating no options . so easy to defend against . 
i need 1 ac milan goal for £40 please
what if genoa scores ....
someone remind me never to put ac milan in an accumulator again just to add a few more £ to my winnings . shite against 10 men
why have milan not taken advantage of this extra man
can ac milan score ??? 1 goal please !
they're down to 10 men , they're genoa and we still suck .
just convinced my aunt to watch milan to watch her when i start back working ☺️
it is painful watching milan struggle . against 10 for an age and have never looked like scoring
" milan from midtable " just sums up allegri's managerial career
ac milan are pure shite can't even beat a team with 10 men at home !
have to say it's another desperate milan display . being held at home by 10-man genoa . 1-1 with 14 min left .
this is disgrace . milan are not da milan sadly .
milan is one of my fav disney movies❤️
milan missing pazzini and el shaarawy so much .
2 goals in the first 10 minutes of the milan match , except from that the games been sooo boring .
i would rather watch istanbul final from 2005 over and over again than watch this milan . ..
this ac milan side has turned the erstwhile fortress called san siro to farm siro . see farming left , right and center . * sighs *
any danger of milan & napoli scoring , plus balotelli missing a pen !!
who told me to put genoa to win ffs
this is oh tm god nialal harry ??: milan
milan are really shit
if napoli and milan don't win i give up
please milan , just 1 goal ...
milan can go and suk their mums
having bad players is no longer an excuse . its just not . we have better players than genoa , chievo and more . not an excuse . 
we can't even beat a 10 man genoa team forza acmilan
galliani is not gonna be happy til allegri rubs milan's face right thru de dirt before he lets him go
go milan
 should replace the player who missed the pinalty .
in football luck only takes you half the journey , you gotta work hard to finish the job off . work hard milan don't wait for luck

omggg milan is sooo fucken shit they need to change this shitty team .... kaka deserves to be in a much better team !!!
ac milan 1 ( kaka ) vs genoa 1 ( gillardino ) keep calm and always fight !!! .. (y )
this match is pretty indicative of the general feeling i’ve had all season watching milan .
such a crisis in milan
another team that needs a new impetus is milan . allegri's a decent coach and did good things there , but it's just not happening this season
thanks for nothing milan . you especially balotelli !

milan doczy scores scores his first career goal as a badger off a great pass from sammy banga to bring the score to 5-3 .

do you remember the days when you'd feel excited to watch milan ? yeah it's hard because that memory is so faint now !!
so ac milan struggling to beat a 10 men genoa and napoli losing to parma at home , wait i've had a bet after ages . 
they're up a man , and all milan can muster are shots from 30 yards out ? are you kidding me ? -al
highly unlucky milan ..
genoa have 0 attempts on goal in the 2nd half . . milan have more than 20
kaka is too good for milan .
we gonna break records today for most shots and most misses in a game aren't we ? 
come on milan ffs show some passion .....
kaka is too good for milan .
ac milan let me down for 150 .. against 10 men for an hour an balotelli missed a pen 
all thought kaka will not be useful . the point is milan are useless without him .
milan hey find a area , they www.monstermmorpg . com to rest . by 
they're up a man , and all milan can muster are shots from 30 yards out ? are you kidding me ? -al
so many chances . drawing a 10 man genoa is a joke-ms

2-0 after 9 minutes & in danger of losing the 2 . 5 ac milan
how are ac milan not winning ?

goodnight , love milan ( ll ' ) 
overall milan is playing great game but right now we need a goal , a freaking goal so kaka
this is just embarassing for milan now 
come on milan
milan there for the taking tuesday after tonights display ! 
anybody here who watches serie a ? what going on first time the in my life i have seen ac milan playing and san siro is empty 
my god ! genoa have been playing with 10 men since in the 1st half yet we can't score !
ac milan are doin me for 85 quid
a bunch of milan references
worst . milan . ever .
the is a reason why genoa is holding milan .... defense !! which foreign coachs and allegri lack
so frustrating watching milan . can only imagine what the last 5 games have been like .
now it has turn to racist chants and banners ? , .... a disgrace !
if ac milan don't score i'll be getting a flight over sharpish to bottle man
milan will always be my favorite disney movie .
this game is a microcosm of milan as a team . lack the ability to score , lack the ability to prevent goals . they everything else well though
milan not being able to beat a 10 man genoa is kinda depressing .
the only thing that will change milan's fortune is allegri's departure . even the gods of luck are up in arms .
i'm gonna go mental if these milan cunts can't even get a goal against 10 men after an hour !
what happened to the old milan ?
this game is a microcosm of milan as a team . lack the ability to score , lack the ability to prevent goals . decent at everything else .
it's getting worse .. curva sud all over the players 
milan's decline is really saddening . one of the great european clubs and they're sitting in mid table .
so it has come to this . milan can't even beat a 10 man team . disgusting .
milan struggling to beat 10 men genoa at home haha why is allegri still in a job its beyond me .
9th april 2011|milan - i wasn't 2nd june 2012|milan - i wasn't 23rd march 2013|bologna - i wasn't maybe next time ? justin bieber
if nothing changes ... parma 16 , milan 14 😐
the mgmt and allegri have taken the joy of watching milan away from us . that is unforgivable .
 have got eight minutes to get a goal against ten-men and save allegri's job ( maybe) . napoli losing to parma as well . 
just saw that kaka scored tonight . my favourite player of all time , sad to think how much better off he'd have been never leaving milan
milan can't even break down 10 man genoa , if celtic were watching this they'd fancy there chances poor side
drawing against genoa at home while they are in 10 men , allegri must be sacked
ac milan can fuck off
milan 2/1 10 to go ...... yes please . 
update : the ac milan can't score a goal
ac milan is average at best right now . washed up players combined with youth that doesn't play
milan better win this game ..
if milan don't snatch a winner then allegri has to go .
the earlier allegri leaves the better fr milan
genoa are starting to attack ! 
watching milan play and seeing balotelli's form just hurts my heart 😥
so fails to win , in sansiro , against genoa , with them playing with 10 men only ! seriously ?
why are ac milan such a rubbish team now , with all their history don't they feel ashamed 😕
ac milan is just a dead team
this is a scarily bad performance from milan . really lethargic .
milan can't even score on a team playing with a man down
genoa's defense is too damn strong . however , dont lose hope . stay positive . 
ok i surrender . do something i can ; t watch milan like this .
really can't wait for january and allegri leaving milan
this is not ac milan ,,, why 11 v 10 , we cannot win
ac milan's best players in the past few games have been birsa & kaka ... says it all really , robinho , balo & matri haven't been up to scratch .
so when do milan get their second penalty of the night ? ( 86 mins , currently 1-1 )
if milan don't win tonight .......
genoa are drawing with milan i don't think milan are that great genoa playing with 10 men gives me great hope for tuesday hh
milan haters can you not
almost 45 and genoa playing with 10 players yet this how milan look like this what happen when you force matri
ac milan are muck
looks like milan have cost me £176 the fucking useless cunts
mario balotelli's penalty records : inter 6/6 city 9/9 milan 6/8 italy 4/4 total 25 out of 27 .
milan you may be cold and frightful but you certainly are delightful 
milan : full names that don't win games
lets go ac milan give me goal
milan too don cast , smh
 1:1 min 87
imagine balotelli got on it tonight with skream in milan !! 😂😂
milan playing with no heart or urgency here .... unbelievable what they have become
this ac milan match is making me fall asleep honestly
no w's for you , milan .
come on milan ! 
is balotalli high ? -milan
we cant beat even genoa lmfaoooooooooooooooo
if even a blind squirrel finds a nut sometimes , why can't milan find another goal with 32 shots , 68% possession , & genoa on 10 men ? 
sweet ac milan cost me 2 bill fukers balotelli missed pen aswl to top it off
c'mon ac milan !
milan a team full of names ? yeah like birsa , zapata , constant
i don't know why but for me it's semi sad to see ac milan deteriorating like this , used to be a powerhouse in europe .
what a sorry sight ac milan are ... 
what is wrong with you milan !!!
#1ddaylive 28 june . san siro . milan . we will be there . we are so happy . we love you
milan 1-1 genoa at 88 '. last time genoa had a shot on milan was 80 minutes ago !
#1ddaylive niall was talking about milan !
i don't understand how ac milan have become so shit in recent times . they're abysmal this season .
how has birsa missed that !? unbelievable ! 
wow ac milan really struggling
i envision milan drawing this game
i never thought i would get tired watching a milan match i have waited a week to watch .
please one goal to milan !!
holy fucking shit dicon conjo mi ta support ac milan ? conjoooo
ac milan are so shit .
the most awful milan team i've seen in years !
birsa could have had a hattrick ! 
this current ac milan side is fucking woeful .
i would have loved to see how this game played out if genoa had 11 men ...
c'mon milan who are you the penguins , with a million chances that don't finish
whaaat the hell . ban pami milan !!
after this head from birsa .. okay milan won't score even if they keep playing till ' tomorrow
milan are officially cursed .. i mean come on ..
this is simply unacceptable from 
ac milan are gone to shite along with italian football 
i have to say : milan is lacking concentration . huge inability to execute . allegri has lost control of this team .
unlucky milan
milan just isn't meant to win this game , are they ?
how dare " milan easy-too panic " 
hopefully , when adil rami signs for ac milan in january , he'll shore up their awful defence .
jesus what a miss by milan . seriously that was sick .
he said milan play with 10 men because matri useless and just waste the opportunity . 
 1-1 90 ' 87 ' for milan to create an goal chance . whatever happens from now , it has been poor . 
all these milan fans getting upset :)
there is a reason a dude like wasn't getting any time at 
88 ' 1-1 : birsa with a quality chance to head home the winner . not happening . 
what's with milan ?
too bad to see how bad is tonight
milan this season have just been painful to watch . currently 10th and closer on points to bottom than top .
that header from sums it up . run timed to perfection but terrible execution . story of the night for milan 
oh my word , birsa missed an absolute sitter as milan reach injury time
and thats why ac milan are in the position there in
come on milan !
shame on you milan its 11 vs 10 kaka scored for you and you couldnt keep it like that
without a doubt perin should be motm . you would have never guessed milan have a man advantage .
this ac milan team is just funny
serie a : milan-genoa 1-1 at half-time milan - milan and genoa are 1-1 level at half-time at the san siro . kaka ' opened t ...
genoa's defence is far too strong
i cant believe milan cant win this match
milan why ?
there will be minimum of 4 added minutes genoa vs ac milan
acm so awful around the box , emmanuelson the most awful of all . and to top that balo missed a pk . idk how milan and lyon game didn't go over
ac milan very need to win . but they cant . its very hard to say
wow . milan are woe . may as well sell all their top players , and start to rebuild . they're going nowhere !
added time +4 , come on milan come on !!!
when i was growing up i used to adore these teams ac milan , real , ajax & monaco
its exactly 3points for genoa ... even the result 1 -1 . game over for allegri i think ...
the fact that bonera is still playing for sums up how terrible their squad is . 
missing person : matri , last seen : warming up before second half milan vs genoa
serie a ac milan vs genoa 7.45 pm- 9.45 pm
if i was the milan coach , i'd have never brought on birsa or sub-out poli .
disgraceful 2nd half performance by milan ... absolutely disgraceful .... should be up 4-1 with all those missed chances
they can't even manage a scrappy win against genoa ?
haha balotelli missed a penalty again . milan 1 genoa 1 .
i now want genoa to win , if only bc they've played with more heart and ten men .
cheers balotelli u prick ! a.c milan are absolute wank , at home playin a shit team with 10 men and can only manage a draw
come on milan
$150 roundtrip tickets to milan , italy . probably a mistake fair , but just booked 4 tickets for pres . day weekend . anyone want to come with ?
last 4 minutes .. come on milan ...!! keep calm and always fight
thanks milan , no really , thanks
hahaha fuck this milan team is embarrassingly bad
those who think ' tata is spoiling barca's legacy , should go and watch the recent matches against real madrid and ac milan 
milan drew and napoli lost , could it get any better ? yes if juve win and roma lose on monday !
you can't rely on ac milan to win ffs
milan cant buy a goal
parma win and milan still can't score !
god help 
no way milan
milan aren't just bad , but unlucky too . everything goes against them .
milan are playing around
milan can't be any worse 
if lose to on tuesday , should be looking for a new job by wednesday lunchtime
milan injury time
milan are absolutely awful atm . celticltic should batter them
genoa have the god of iron on speed dial
milan is really really really sick ..
what a mess to ac milan
come milan . please score .
but performance v genoa can only really be described as woeful .
so milan will do se ge se ge , like nko osu and draw dis match against genoa , can't remember d last time we tasted victory in seriea
come on milan :(
milan failing to see off a team of 10 men however doesn't surprise me 
its like god is against milan winning , either that or these guys don't practise shooting in training .
napoli lost , milan i beg of you . score .
please cmon milan
ac milan are just shit .
genoa counter attack 2-1 watch
hang on !!!
i don't even enjoy milan doing this poorly
first milan and now sister act !
ac milan a dead team since pirlo left
just sack allegri and get me inzaghi instead . 
come on milan !!
meanwhile back at the ranch ... ac milan still can't win a solid game :/
#1ddaylive niall always talks about italy !! and expecially milan !!
milan are fuckin scums man
ac milan no fit comeback like last season fa
great defending so far by genoa . only if they can score a counter now ...
allegri is just a big time sucker . he can't even beat a 10 man genoa . smh in disgust .
milan are simply cursed
milan are so shit man
so you missing cassano inter milan ?
stupid milan performance !!
10 man genoa they are a heroes !! trying harder milan !
can't be that milan can't beat genoa at home , with them 10 men for all 2nd half . can it ?
ac milan are not the team they used to be . very average tonight . when they played at ibrox they were far better . the legends were better .
milan has only had one victory in the past ten games . this is just not good enough . where is my milan ?
can't believe this , fuck off ac milan
* sigh * .. we cant beat 9 man genoa ( 9 men because 1 red card and antonini )
genoa almost played the whole match with only 10 men !!! and still some idiots think milan is a great team !!! 
what the fucking milan
get draw against ten men . especially , it's genoa . things can't get any worse .
milan are woeful this year . sweet jesus .
ac milan you stupid pricks
come on , genoa . you should've won this game .. dominating performance from start to finish .
unlucky milan !!!
how the hell did milan tie - . -
napoli loss , milan potential draw . this was a good day :)
damn , so this is what we got . ft milan 1-1 genoa . 
honestly , fuck you milan and fuck you balotelli
milan and napoli both didn't win haha:')
and finally napoli n milan finally make this saturday the poorest have ever seen
fucking hell milan . get a grip !!!
milan won't score even if this game goes on for 3 days . 
boss that from genoa . great digging in .
milan gets a tap in in the 94th minute and zapata fail ...
haiyoo milan , why u guys cannot score ??
so unlucky ac milan
hahaha for milan .... ??
we just drew with 10-man genoa . 
full time ; ac milan - genoa 1-1 goals : kaka 1-0 , gilardino pen 1-1 
my wish is to go too milan , italy 😬😉👍✌️🇮🇹
then you have a shit milan who can't even beat a 10 man genoa at home . balotelli horrible .
disgrace !!! disgrace for the whole milan !
good bye milan 
fuck full time milan 1 - 1 genoa
 would be much better with 10 players than having balotelli on the field !!
can't wait for celtic v ac milan tuesday
milan deserved to win today . allegri walks off the pitch smiling hysterically
wow curva sud are just making it worse for milan .
cheers milan , didn't want that £120 anyway .
